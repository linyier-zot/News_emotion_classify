'888888,0,Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday said Wuhan city had turned the tide against the deadly coronavirus, as he made his first visit to the virus\' epicentre in a message that Beijing has the situation under control and vowed to resolutely fight for a victory against the novel COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nWearing a protective mask and accompanied by a retinue of military and health officials, Xi - who initially came under criticism for not acting in time to stem the virus when it first showed up in December last year, but later won praise for a decisive\nfollow-up action - visited a makeshift hospital and community residents and frontline workers in Wuhan.\nXi, 66, vowed to resolutely fight for a victory in the war against the coronavirus during his inspection tour of Wuhan, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\nDuring his visit, Xi said the spread of coronavirus had been basically curbed in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan where over 50 million people lived in total isolation since January 23 following a complete lockdown of the areas.\nThe initial success has been made in stabilising the situation and turning the tide in Hubei and Wuhan, Xi said.\nAhead of the President\'s visit on Tuesday, China\'s National Health Commission announced a dramatic drop in number of COVID-19 cases both of which fell below 20 mark for the first time since the NHC began daily reporting of cases in later part of January.\nThe NHC reported 19 new confirmed cases of infection and 17 fatalities on Monday. All the 17 new deaths were in Hubei province and in Wuhan, while Beijing and other cities geared up for "imported cases" with the return of large number of Chinese and foreigners to re-join work.\nThe overall confirmed cases in the Chinese mainland have reached 80,754 by the end of Monday. This included 3,136 people who died of the disease. 17,721 patients are still undergoing treatment while 59,897 patients have been discharged after recovery, the NHC said.\nWhile the virus has abated in China, it has spread to over 100 countries. The death toll has reached 4,011 globally with more than 110,000 cases of infection.\nThis is the second visit to Wuhan by a top Chinese leader.\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan on January 26 when the COVID-19 virus spread at an alarming pace, prompting a lockdown of the city and the Central Hubei province with 50 million people.\nXi, also general secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and head of the military, called for firm, solid and meticulous prevention and control efforts to defend Hubei and Wuhan.\nThe coronavirus has become a major challenge to Xi\'s leadership who is often referred to as China\'s most powerful leader after the CPC founder Mao Zedong, with the prospect of life-long tenure in power.\nAfter over three-month long battle against the virus, China has come to a grinding halt with estimated losses of over USD 103 billion.\nThe virus has also caused acute distress among people as China locked down the Hubei province while implemented stringent measures all over the country including closure of factories and offices to contain the virus.\nXi said after hard work, the situation in Hubei and Wuhan had shown positive changes with important progress, but the prevention and control task remain arduous.\nHe praised the sacrifices of people of Wuhan and Hubei province.\nThe positive trend in preventing and controlling the virus could not have been achieved without the sacrifice, devotion, perseverance and hard efforts of the people of Wuhan, Xi said.\nWith their concrete actions, Wuhan people have demonstrated the strength and spirit of China, as well as the Chinese people\'s love for the family and the nation, which enables them to stick together through thick and thin, he said.\nAfter his arrival in Wuhan, Xi went straight to Huoshenshan Hospital, the 1000-bed makeshift hospital built in record time of less than 10 days to inspect thousands of cases.\nChina also built another 1300-bed hospital equally in record time, rushed over 30,000 medical staff from the military as well as from all over to treat the spiralling number of cases.\nThe official media reported with the cases falling in big numbers, all the makeshift hospitals numbering over 14 are now being dismantled in Wuhan.\nAt the hospital, Xi greeted medical staff through television monitor and learned about community-based efforts for epidemic prevention and control, Xinhua reported.\nHe also visited residents of a community in Wuhan who are subject to self-quarantine, looking into the community-level prevention and control work as well as daily necessity supply.\nXi\'s visit sent a strong signal to the entire country and the world that China is ascending out of the darkest moment amid the outbreak, and the battle against the epidemic has now entered the next stage, state-run Global Times quoted analysts assaying.\nXi\'s Wuhan visit at this moment shows the turning point of China\'s domestic fight against the epidemic has arrived and now the fight is shifting its focus to prevent imported cases of infection and gradually resume economic activities and production, analysts said.\nLu Keli, an associate professor at the school of Marxism studies in the Renmin University of China in Beijing told the Global Times that Xi\'s visit showed that China had achieved a phased victory at the current juncture that can help effectively stabilise and control the epidemic situation.\n'
'888888,0,China has published new data on more than 44,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, which show the disease is not as deadly as previous coronaviruses including SARS and MERS./nThe World Health Organization reports more than 70,000 cases, including 1,772 deaths, mostly from China\'s Hubei province, where the outbreak first surfaced. Cases in 25 countries outside China have increased slightly to 694, including three deaths, one each in the Philippines, Japan and France./nThe data appear to show a decline in the number of new cases of coronavirus. But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this should be interpreted with great caution because trends can change as new populations are affected./nMore than 94 percent of all reported cases in China come from Hubei province. The new cases reported are both clinically and lab-confirmed cases.

He says they are trying to better understand the origin of the outbreak and its evolution./n'
"888888,0,On March 2, Indonesia finally confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 infection. \n This came after weeks of denial by the government and bizarre reactions by various public officials, raising questions on Jakarta’s priorities and preparedness in dealing with the issue. \n Following China’s announcement of its first fatality on Jan 11, the general attitude in Indonesia was that the virus that caused Covid-19 was strictly a foreign issue and would not enter the country. \n After a cabinet meeting on the issue on Jan 25, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo announced a number of measures to offset possible ramifications for the domestic economy.\xa0 \n Tellingly, none of the measures were aimed at ramping up public health readiness to deal with a possible viral outbreak, a likely scenario given Indonesia’s trade links with China. \n Throughout February, as neighbouring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia reported cases of Covid-19 infection, the Indonesian government kept insisting that the country had no infections. \n Harvard University's Professor Marc Lipsitch said on Feb 11 that his research suggested it was almost impossible that there were no infected individuals in Indonesia, given its volume of air travel links with Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. He cited underreporting to explain Indonesia’s zero-infection status. This was vehemently denied by Jakarta.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n Indonesian Health Minister Dr Terawan Agus Putranto called the study an “insult” to Indonesia and attributed the zero infection statistics to the “strength of prayer” and “protection from the Almighty”. \n He also claimed that his ministry was following World Health Organization procedures to detect the virus. \n However, an Indonesian migrant worker returning from Hong Kong in early March professed to local media her “bewilderment” at the lack of proper checks such as temperature scanning at the Juanda Airport in Surabaya. She had only been asked to fill in a form.\xa0\xa0 \n February also saw the repatriation of 238 Indonesian citizens from Wuhan. Although they were quarantined and observed for 14 days, it later transpired that they were never medically tested for the virus. \n Achmad Yurianto, a Health Ministry official, defended the decision by claiming that none of the 238 displayed any symptoms for respiratory disease and therefore required no laboratory tests, even though asymptomatic transmissions have been documented elsewhere. \n It was difficult to avoid the impression that Jakarta was burying its head in the sand.\xa0\xa0 \n Even after the formal confirmation of Covid-19 infections, Jakarta seemed reluctant to roll out comprehensive measures to curb the outbreak. \n It is also worth noting that the two infected individuals were tested after alerting the authorities themselves. \n The mother and daughter from Depok had gone to a hospital themselves after falling ill. The hospital misdiagnosed the daughter with bronchitis and the mother with typhus. \n The daughter, a professional dancer by the name of Sita, then learnt that a female Japanese tourist who had been at an event she had hosted was diagnosed with the virus in Malaysia. \n Ms Sita informed the hospital this and asked to be tested for Covid-19. To her horror, however, she learned about her positive status not from the hospital but on television when she saw a press conference by Mr Widodo. \n A leak of their personal details alleged by someone in the government then led to the pair being trolled online, with fake news being circulated that the tourist was a man and Ms Sita had “danced with him in a nightclub”. \n Many Indonesian social media users even professed having no sympathy for Ms Sita because she had been infected “by behaving loosely”. \n The public hounding of Indonesia’s first two Covid-19 victims may have the undesirable effect of dissuading more Indonesians with symptoms from coming forward, knowing they may be stigmatised when they are found to be infected.\xa0 \n It certainly does not help when the religious establishment, represented by the Indonesian Council of Ulema, also supports the idea that there is something un-Islamic about being infected with Covid-19. \n In a press release on March 3, the government-funded body claimed that as long as Indonesian Muslims do not eat anything “haram” or unclean according to the Quran, they are safe from Covid-19. \n It said the virus is “a rebuke from Allah” for those who eat “unclean food, such as pork, human blood or live animals, which always bring diseases”. \n Given that Vice President Ma’ruf Amin is also the outfit’s chairman, its statement is likely to have been sanctioned by the government. \n Days before the statement, Mr Amin himself had reiterated the view that Indonesia’s “zero-infection” status was due to divine protection. “Many clerics recite the qunut (dawn prayer), including myself, which is why the coronavirus is banished from Indonesia,” he said. \n The haphazard way in which the Indonesian government has reacted to the Covid-19 outbreak underscores its fear that it will trigger mass hysteria among Indonesians as well as of the negative economic repercussions. \n This would explain why, even after the confirmation of infections on March 2, Mr Widodo still boasted that Indonesia is somehow benefitting from the outbreak. \n On one occasion, he professed himself “pleased” that, thanks to the epidemic, optimism for doing business in Indonesia rose to above 50 per cent while that for China fell to 35.\xa0\xa0 \n In reality, the country’s public health system is ill-prepared to deal with a full-blown crisis. \n To date, only hospitals and health institutions in Jakarta and Surabaya are capable of testing for Covid-19 with accuracy. Bali, Indonesia’s top tourist destination, has no laboratory which can identify the virus. \n Indonesia’s hospital bed to population ratio is also low at 12 per 10,000, half that of Singapore while there are only 3.9 doctors for every 10,000 Indonesians. The fact it is also an archipelago of 18,000 islands makes any containment effort challenging. \n On March 6, the Indonesian government confirmed two more Covid-19 cases, after tracing 20 people who interacted with the first two cases.\xa0\xa0 \n While this signals a greater degree of realism and action, Jakarta should have been more transparent with the public from the beginning, instead of trying to play down the threat Covid-19 posed. \n In this internet age where Indonesians can access information readily, running a narrative which was at odds with the rest of the world only resulted in diminished public trust in the government. \n Evidently, Indonesia did not learn much from how it handled the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in 2003. \n Although Jakarta set up an emergency fund worth tens of millions of dollars to contain the outbreak, as well as forcibly quarantined individuals suspected of having contracted Sars, it was never transparent about how many Indonesians were infected.\xa0 \n The lack of credible data even gave rise to the belief that Sars somehow passed Indonesia by. \n We appear to be seeing a repeat of this now with the Covid-19 outbreak. It is not too late for the Jokowi administration to restore public trust in its ability to contain the virus. \n The central government must also ensure that its steps are in tandem with its counterparts on the regional levels. At the moment, a serious lack of coordination exists. \n Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan for example has ruffled some feathers by declaring a state of emergency in the capital city, though no comprehensive measures have been rolled out. \n Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security Mahfud MD, without mentioning names, has warned regional leaders against using the outbreak to score political points.\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n Time is of the essence here and Indonesia should act now, especially as the country confirmed two more cases on March 8 and can expect more infections in the days ahead.\xa0 \n \xa0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Johannes Nugroho is a writer and political analyst from Surabaya whose commentaries have appeared in the Jakarta Post and Jakarta Globe since the 1990s. \n "

'888888,0,The new Coronavirus is spreading with enormous dynamism, despite the countermeasures taken by the Chinese authorities. Throughout the world, researchers try to deduce from the still young development as many characteristics of the organism as possible. What you know and what you don\'t:\n-CORONAVIREN: The pathogen 2019-nCoV is one of the Coronaviruses, so called because they are surrounded by zackenlike structures that resemble a crown. Seven representatives of this group cause respiratory diseases in humans. Three of these are known to cause some serious symptoms: in the case of Sars virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome) also originating in China, 2002/2003 became known around 8000 cases, around 800 people died. ==References====External links====External links==* Official website It is less contagious, but more aggressive: from around 2500 infected to November 2019, nearly 860- about every third died. 2019-nCoV is very closely related to Sars.\nINFECTIOSITY: It is difficult to assess how infectious the new virus is. The Chinese authorities assume that an infected person infects on average 1,4 to 2,5 people, which would be similar to Sars. "Such figures are extremely unreliable," says the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite. Consequently, the rate of transmission depends on many factors, such as whether people are socially active or stay at home. That is what the measures in China are aimed at. "I think these measures are doing something." It is positive that people usually only become infectious with the symptom, unlike the flu, where people are already infectious before they get sick.\n-AGGRESSIVITY: The new Coronavirus appears to be less aggressive than Sars and Mers. By Monday, 80-year-olds of around 2800-year-old infected died, corresponding to a 2,9-percent mortality rate.\nYeah. However, the number is likely to be misleading, because it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that the serious cases become known. Three percent mortality would be very much, in Drostens\'opinion. The expert assumes that the ten percent given for sars is also a much too high value. "There was probably much more than the well-known 8000 Sars cases," he explains.\n-SYMPTOME: The incubation period between infection and onset of symptoms is two to 14 days. The lung disease is manifested by fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. Because the virus infects the lower respiratory tract, sufferers have no flu. Eventually, the symptoms resemble a Sars infection. No wonder, because the new virus docks at the same receptor. The test on the virus is usually based on sputum (ejection) analysis and lasts about two hours.\nThere is no special treatment for lung disease. Severely ill patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-reducing agents, the treatment of possible additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation.\n-IMPFUNG: Vaccination would be the best way to contain the epidemic. According to Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine, vaccine candidates are currently being tested against Mers in humans. Provided they are successful, they will be available at the earliest in a few months. "This could then be built on," says Schmidt-Chanasit.\n-RESERVOIRE: The reservoirs of various coronavirus are located in the animal kingdom. With Mers, camels are the origin, with Sars and the new pathogen, the reservoirs are probably with bats. The Sars pathogen probably jumped on humans from kittens offered on Chinese markets. Also 2019-nCoV is probably based on an animal market in China. The species of animal from which the virus jumped is currently unknown\nYeah.\nFor protection against this virus as well as other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to the sick. Schmidt-Chanasit and Drosten consider the usefulness of normal breathing masks, as seen everywhere on the streets today in China, to be rather low.\nPROGNOSEN: Some experts expect a long outbreak. "We should regard this as a marathon and not a sprint," said Chris Whitty, who advises the British Government on health issues. "The extent and impact of this outbreak is currently unclear because the situation is developing rapidly," wrote a team about Anthony Fauci from the US National Health Institutes (NIH) in the specialist journal "JAMA". The virologist Drosten, on the other hand, can imagine that the epidemic ends just as quickly as the Sars outbreak, which was quickly flayed and 2004 was declared to have ended. "I am inclined to think optimistically, because this is a Sars-like disease." It is also true that there has so far been little spread outside China. "This is extremely encouraging." Sars continues to train, but only in the animal kingdom. (dpa) +++ This article was published on 27. January at 17.58 o\'clock updated +++\n'
'888888,0,Affected by the bullish sales situation of masks, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, which fell due to the epidemic, rose sharply against the market this morning (23), in which both Ogilvy medical and Zhende medical rose to the limit.\nMacao rationed mask\nIn Macao, after the first case of Wuhan pneumonia was confirmed yesterday (22), people rushed out to buy masks. Although some of the masks were priced up, legislator Lin Yufeng observed that within two or three hours, the masks on the market had been taken out of stock. In order to prevent confusion, the government immediately announced that the masks should be given to residents as soon as possible today, and many casinos in mainland China were staffed yesterday At midnight, the government ordered casino staff to wear masks.\nThe Macao government announced that from tonight, Macao residents with ID cards and external labor cards can purchase 10 masks at a price of mop 8 in more than 50 pharmacies, and only once in 10 days. Li zhanrun, director of the Bureau of health, said that the government had ordered more than 20 million masks to arrive before the Spring Festival. It is expected that each resident can have more than 40 masks, which can cope with more than 40 days based on one per person per day.\nMask market breaking crisis in Hong Kong during Spring Festival\nIn Hong Kong, the government does not have a mask rationing plan. With two cases of "highly suspected" infection yesterday, the rush to buy them immediately followed. Liu Aiguo, vice president of the General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong and Kowloon pharmacies, said in a radio program this morning that although the pharmacies had already added masks earlier, most of the masks in drug rooms in Hong Kong have been "out of stock". His pharmacies sold more than 10000 masks yesterday. He added that the pharmacy will be closed in the coming spring and may not be able to replenish until the 10th of the year (February 3).\nIn the rush to buy, businesses have their own strategies. In addition to raising the price, some businesses have increased the price to launch a mask that was pointed out to have quality problems in Japan at the beginning of last year. Some buyers have pointed out on the Internet that the packaging Wuchang, but they found that the mask only had one layer when it was used, and it is still used without protection. Other netizens suspect that Chinese manufacturers, commissioned by Japanese businesses to make masks, dumped their products in Hong Kong that had been produced but not destroyed.\nIt\'s still hard to forbid price hikers to work overtime in China\nIn mainland China, price hikes of masks are common. Authorities in Beijing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai and Chengdu have successively issued notices asking drugstores and other sellers not to raise prices. The market supervision bureau said it would investigate and punish all kinds of illegal acts such as price bid up, hoarding and price fraud, and the violators would be given heavier punishment according to law\n。 Among them, Shanghai may impose a maximum fine of less than 3 million yuan; if the circumstances are serious, Shanghai may be ordered to suspend business for rectification or even to nail the brand.\nHowever, businesses in Shanghai still face the wind and violate the rules. According to the economic daily, a supermarket in Minhang District of the city was reported on the 21st, saying that the masks sold by the shop owners on the spot were not priced, but the prices marked on the Internet increased by 20% to 1.6 times. In addition, some businesses raised the price of anti epidemic products from 158 yuan to 398 yuan within three days. The authorities have put the business on file for investigation.\nPrice hikes are also common on multiple online shopping platforms. Take 30 9132 N95 masks with 3M brand as an example. There are Taobao stores that have raised their prices four times to 398 yuan (the same below), and 20 N95 masks with 160S brand have been raised ten times to 998 yuan. By yesterday, Taobao, Jingdong, pinduoduo, Suning e-commerce, hungry and other platforms have successively issued notices to prohibit platform businesses from raising prices when selling masks. Taobao also issued a statement on the official microblog, saying that there are sufficient supplies of masks on the platform at present and that it has provided special subsidies for masks to ensure that consumers can buy genuine masks at affordable prices.\nIn addition, there are also manufacturers of protective equipment to increase wages for employees to sell masks. Chinese media reported that the head of Zhende medical said that the factory had urgently called on employees who were taking Spring Festival leave to work overtime to produce masks and would give priority to CDC and medical institutions. In addition, hengming medicine, which supplies Taobao tmall and other online platforms, recalled employees on holiday to return to work in an emergency on the 21st, paying 3 to 5 times their salaries to workers, and fully reimbursed transportation, accommodation and other expenses to ensure the supply of masks.\n'

However, the property management company of the community then issued a notice to clearly announce that four confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia have been found in the community and are under isolation treatment.\nIn January 25th, the official media reported, "(Tianjin) public security organs found in their work that Xi Moumou made false statements about the number of new coronavirus infecting pneumonia in WeChat\'s friends circle during the period from 11 to 14 January 24, 2020. At 19:00 on January 24, Xi was arrested by the peace branch of the Public Security Bureau. Xi has confessed to the above illegal facts and is now under administrative detention in accordance with the law. " There is no detail about what he fabricated.\nWhy the authorities are so nervous? Yang qianrun, a counselor in the circle of friends, has a good understanding of the state of mind of the authorities: "even if you know the truth, even if you say the truth, please don\'t go around in disorder. You\'re not helping, you\'re not reminding people to pay attention to protection. Your information scares the people, causes the collapse of the national government, and it\'s up to you to turn the tide " It\'s a bit of a sermon from Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels.\nThe reporter dare to speak\nZhang Eurasian, a reporter from Hubei Daily, felt that Wuhan had caused such a great loss to the whole country and wrote a blog call for "an immediate change of commander for Wuhan". The most ridiculous Hubei Daily sent an apology to the Wuhan municipal Party committee, and even shamelessly sent a letter to the Wuhan authorities, apologizing for "adding obstruction and chaos" to the leaders.\nOn January 24, Zhang Eurasian, a reporter from Hubei Daily, tweeted that Wuhan\'s "top leaders" must "make a decisive change". "Like many people, I used to think that temporary change is not familiar with leadership and is not conducive to work, but according to the increasingly serious and expanding situation, the current people on the stage do not have such leadership and command power," he said "For the sake of Wuhan, I hope to change the commander immediately!!!"\nThe post was blocked, and the Hubei Daily of the Communist Party of China responded quickly. On that day, it immediately sent a letter to Wuhan Municipal Committee and government to apologize and review\n。 "This morning, Zhang Eurasian, an employee of our group, made a wrong speech on his personal micro blog, adding disorder to the current prevention and control work, and blocking leaders at all levels," said in the letter about the explanation and apology of the group\'s employees for their wrong speech on their personal micro blog I\'m sorry.\nHubei Daily also requires that "all employees\' personal microblogs, wechat and other self-Media and friend circles shall not publish or forward bad information or information not reported or verified by the media, but can only spread positive energy to form a chorus of people of one mind."\nIn January 24th, when reporters asked for the same day as commander in chief, Ma Guoqiang, commander of the Wuhan municipal Party committee and Secretary of the municipal new type of pneumonia prevention and control headquarters, stressed that "we should integrate ideas and actions with general secretary Xi Jinping\'s important instructions and the Central Committee\'s decision making arrangements" to ensure that the fever patients are treated in a timely manner. It\'s funny.\nI\'ve been a senior official in Hubei for a long time\nObservers at home and abroad have realized that such a serious situation in Wuhan is caused by China\'s institutional problems, not by the neglect of government by one city or several low-level officials. Why did Wuhan delay such a long time, officials or dare not report, eliminate the problem on the spot, fear to make things big, hope that big things become smaller and smaller, because in need of positive energy, listening to good words, or above ambiguous attitude, this matter, why Xi Jinping did not speak for forty days later, it is doubtful that the central level must not escape this crisis. As a result, on these two days, we should go all out to fight against pneumonia in Wuhan in the last few days. After that, officials should boldly point their finger at the local authorities in Wuhan, such as the people\'s daily and the global times.\nThe people\'s daily and the global times criticized Wuhan authorities for "not timely and accurate information disclosure", referring to their "boldness", which caused panic. However, "boldness" is behind fluke, ignorance of the laws of infectious disease prevention and control, and ignorance of their own and others\' health risks. " A decent voice.\nHu Xijin, editor in chief of the global times, also mentioned in summing up the panic wave of the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan that the supervision function of the news media has been weakened by some functional departments that have nothing to do with propaganda but are very strong at all levels and places. There are so many multimedia people in Wuhan, but they have not issued their own warnings outside the health system\n。 The official tolerance of various voices on the Internet is also too low. Eight people who gave warnings on the Internet in Wuhan were interviewed by the public security at that time, which suppressed the whole public opinion to further discuss the risk of the new virus and continue to give warnings.\nSome analysts believe that the official system is always the same. If something goes wrong, the official media are busy washing the land for the leaders, exonerating them, transferring the responsibility, and catching a scapegoat. Wait and see how long Hubei officials can be.\nWang Xiaodong, governor of Hubei Province, said on Sunday that "after the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia, the Central Committee of the party and the whole nation were worried. We felt very sad, very guilty and very self reproach." Some netizens commented, "what did you do early? Eight people were arrested and a city was harmed. I\'m afraid you are afraid of losing your official position, so you said it\'s very sad.".\n'

The teams will be in contact with them,"he said. If you agree to stay in voluntary quarantine (or prophylactic isolation, the term legally used), you may stay at home, or at the premises of the Ministry of Health, which are in hospitals but does not mean that you are hospitalized.

'888888,0,Moody\'s on Monday slashed India\'s growth forecast for 2020 to 5.4 per cent from 6.6\xa0per cent projected earlier, on slower than expected economic recovery.\n\nIn its update on Global Macro Outlook, Moody\'s Investors Service said India\'s economy has decelerated rapidly over the last 2 years and economic recovery is likely to be \'shallow\'.\n"While the economy may well begin to recover in the current quarter, we expect any recovery to be slower than we had previously expected. Accordingly, we have revised our growth forecasts to 5.4 per cent for 2020 and 5.8 per cent for 2021, down from our previous projections of 6.6 per cent\xa0and 6.7 per cent respectively," Moody\'s said.\nMoody\'s growth projections are based on calendar year and as per its estimates, India\'s GDP grew 5 per cent in 2019.\nThe rating agency had in November 2019 projected India’s economic growth in 2020 and 2021 at 6.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively.\nIn its latest update, Moody\'s said the reduction in India\'s growth rate reflects domestic challenges rather than external factors.\nStating that the key to stronger economic momentum would be the revival of domestic demand and bank credit growth, Moody\'s said the Union Budget 2020 did not contain a significant stimulus to address the demand slump.\nWith a weak economy and depressed credit growth reinforcing each other, Moody\'s said, "It is difficult to envision a quick turnaround of either, even if economic deceleration may have troughed."\n"As similar policies in other countries have shown, tax cuts are unlikely to translate into higher consumer and business spending when risk aversion is high," Moody\'s said.\n\nThe rating agency said it expects additional easing by the Reserve Bank.\nHowever, if the recent rise in CPI inflation, mainly as a result of higher food prices, is seen to have second-round effects, this would make it more challenging for the central bank to cut interest rates further, it added.\nThe RBI has lowered the repo rate by a cumulative 135 bps in 2019.\nInflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to a 68-month-high of 7.59 per cent in January.\nRBI\'s mandated target range for retail inflation is 2-6 per cent and the central bank aims to keep it at 4 per cent over the medium term.\nMoody\'s said that resumption of credit growth is equally important as reviving demand, and banks have been reluctant to lend or lower lending rates despite successive rate cuts by the RBI.\n"...credit impulse in the economy has deteriorated throughout the last year as a result of the drying up of lending from non-bank financial institutions as well as from banks," Moody\'s said.\nIt said the deterioration in credit growth to the commercial sector is particularly “stark”.\nNominal credit to industry grew at only 1.6 per cent year-on-year in December 2019, while credit to the services sector registered 6.2 per cent\xa0nominal growth, and credit to agriculture and related activities grew 5.3 per cent, it added.\nWith regard to global growth, Moody\'s said coronavirus outbreak has diminished optimism about prospects of an incipient stabilisation of global growth this year.\nGlobal\xa0GDP growth forecast has been revised down, and Moody\'s now expects G-20 economies to collectively grow 2.4 per cent in 2020, a softer rate than last year, followed by a pick up to 2.8 per cent \xa0in 2021.\n"We have reduced our growth forecast for China to 5.2 per cent in 2020 and maintain our expectation of 5.7 per cent growth in 2021," it added.\nMoody\'s expects that the\xa0spread of coronavirus will be contained by the end of March, and normal economic activity would resume in April-June quarter.\n"At present, China\'s economy is by far the worst affected. However, the rest of the world also has exposure as a result of a hit to global tourism in the first half of this year and short-term disruptions to supply chains," it said.\n"The effects on the global economy could compound if the rate of infection does not abate and the death toll continues to rise, because supply chain disruptions in manufacturing would become more acute the longer it takes to restore normalcy," Moody\'s added.\nThe death toll from China\'s coronavirus epidemic rose to over 1,660, with over 68,500 confirmed cases.\nThe coronavirus outbreak originated in central China\'s Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries.\nMany countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have suspended flights to the country.\n'
'888888,0,Even as countries around the world impose lockdowns in the stepped-up fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the United States and China find themselves embroiled in a different battle: the blame game. US President Donald Trump has pointedly and repeatedly called Covid-19 a "Chinese virus" - a term that stigmatises that nation, while a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official promoted conspiracy theories that the virus was brought to China by the US military. Neither, of course, is correct. Health experts have been quick to point out that pandemics have no nationality or ethnicity, and the use of terms which imply that viruses do have ethnic origins can, and indeed have led to discriminatory practices. \n But this is also more than a problem of discrimination. The pandemic is now threatening to derail a US-China relationship that was just starting to stabilise. Continued name-calling will hamper global coordination at a time when it is most in need. That the pandemic has become the latest irritant in their bilateral relationship is perhaps not surprising. The politics of the moment plays very much into the nativist, nationalist tendencies that is seeing a resurgence globally. Having watched the pandemic wreak havoc on the economic growth that he tied so closely to his own political fate, Mr Trump senses some advantages in portraying the crisis as a foreign threat. White House officials highlighted criticisms of China\'s handling of the virus in the outbreak\'s early days - saying the pandemic could have been avoided if Beijing had done the right thing at the start. \n '
"888888,0,At the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. The first cases in France were announced in January\nYeah. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\n"

'888888,0,(REUTERS) - The effects of the coronavirus outbreak are likely to reverberate beyond China as most major economies in the region are expected to either slow down significantly, halt or shrink outright in the current quarter, Reuters polls of economists found. \n Singapore is forecast to be the worst affected from the fallout, with growth dropping by more than 1 percentage point for 2020. The least impact would be on Indonesia, which is expected to grow 4.7 per cent this year. \n A port city and a major trade partner with China, Singapore is expected to contract 0.6 per cent in the January to March quarter of this year, a first since the 2009 recession after the global financial crisis. \n Many Asian economies, which were just limping back to growth from the spillover effects of the 18-month\xa0United States-China trade dispute, were again dealt a blow by the outbreak, which has shut down businesses and cities. \n With the Covid-19 contagion interrupting global supply chains that most countries depend on for trade and commerce, economic activity is likely to slow, but at varying degrees. \n Forecasts from economists collected from Feb 19 to 25 showed that Singapore, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand are all expected to put in their worst performance in years in the first quarter. Only Indonesia is expected to remain relatively unscathed. \n "The impact of the coronavirus on economies in Asia is potentially huge, as tourism in the region takes a beating. From deserted hotels to empty airports, the impact of this little scrap of protein and lipid on economies in the region is potentially enormous," said Mr Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research for Asia-Pacific at ING in Singapore. \n "If this doesn\'t sound sufficiently scary, bear in mind that tourism is just one of the channels through which the coronavirus can weaken the GDP growth of Asian countries grappling with this epidemic." \n A similar Reuters poll published a little over a week ago found that the Chinese economy will grow at its slowest pace in the current quarter since the financial crisis, with a worst-case scenario showing it at 3.5 per cent, nearly half of the 6\xa0per cent reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. \n "The base case is rapidly shifting from \'Bad\', meaning only China is impacted, to \'Ugly\', where both emerging Asia and developed economies see soaring infection rates and deaths," said Mr Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Asia-Pacific at Rabobank in Hong Kong. \n "Its effects will likely resemble the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 more than the Sars outbreak in 2003," he said, referring to the economic impact. \n That fear in financial markets was clear on Monday, when world stocks took a nosedive to a two-year low as a surge in virus infections outside mainland China fuelled fears of a global pandemic. \n Proximity to the region\'s economic powerhouse and trade relations mean any impact from a slowdown in the world\'s second-largest economy is likely to be felt across the region. \n While a bounce back in the next quarter is expected for most major Asian economies polled, growth for this year is likely to be lower than predicted just last month, suggesting some activity would be permanently lost. \n More than three-quarters of economists, 57 of 77, who answered an additional question also expect growth across these other Asian economies to pick up in the second quarter. \n While South Korea was the hardest hit by the virus outside China, its impact on the economy so far seems modest, according to forecasters who expect it to grow 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, down only 0.4 percentage point from a January Reuters poll. \n Thailand\'s and Taiwan\'s economies are forecast to expand at a paltry 0.2 per cent and 1.3 per cent in the current quarter, the lowest in nearly half a decade. \n Australia\'s economy, a proxy for Chinese economic growth, is forecast to grind to a halt in the current quarter, ending the country\'s near three-decade growth streak that\xa0started in 1991. \n "This (the virus outbreak) can be hurtful to growth in several countries beyond just the negative spillovers from China. A sharp rise in infections reported by several countries raises concerns of a deeper hit to these countries and also global growth," said Ms Johanna Chua, emerging markets Asia economist at Citi in Hong Kong. \n But if the grim outlook does not improve, under a worst-case scenario, economists expect growth in all countries polled to drop further by 0.5 percentage point to 1\xa0full percentage point. \n '

'888888,0,The number of deaths caused by a new type of pneumonia in China rose this Tuesday to 17, with the death of eight more patients in Hubei Province, where the city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, is located. The total number of infected in that region alone is already greater than 440, while total patients throughout Chinese territory have risen to 547, officials announced. With this new data, the total number of cases detected worldwide increased to 55.\nIn Wuhan, a metropolis of nine million inhabitants, an unprecedented order was given to stop the contagion: no one leaves the city and public transport services are suspended. The airport departure terminal has been shut down and long-distance trains will follow if they make stops in the city.\nThe measures reflect the nervousness of the Beijing authorities, at a time when the largest annual migration on the planet is taking place: the Chinese Lunar New Year festivities, which move around the country hundreds of millions of people taking the opportunity to visit family and friends, As with Christmas in Western countries. According to the Chinese Ministry of Transport, the country must register a total of three billion domestic journeys over the next forty days. This is even the worst time of year to deal with a virus in China.\nThe figures released this Wednesday still harbour fears about a possible pandemic similar to that of atypical pneumonia, or Severe Acute Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 killed 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong.\nFaced with this scenario, the Chinese National Health Commission announced further measures to contain the disease, including disinfection of ventilation systems at airports, stations and shopping centres across the country.\nYeah. "If necessary, temperature controls will also be carried out in key areas and busy locations," said the reporting state body.\nThe total number of Chinese provinces with recorded cases of the new coronavirus is now 24, to which Hong Kong and Macao join. In the last ancient Portuguese territory, the authorities confirmed the case of a 52-year-old merchant woman from the Chinese city of Wuhan who arrived in Macao on the 19th day and who was subjected to two tests confirming the disease. Currently committed in isolation at the Count of Saint January Hospitality Centre, is considered a high-risk patient.\nHowever, the Macanese authorities stress that there is no outbreak in the territory at the moment. But there are preventive measures in place: daily visits to hospitals will be reduced from two periods to one and public spaces are being cleaned up, cases of bus stops and taxis and municipal markets.\nIn Hong Kong, the case of a 39-year-old man who had visited Wuhan is confirmed and, according to Hong Kong Health Secretary Sophia Chan, he is "highly suspected" of contracting the virus. The authorities have also set up an emergency telephone line to meet people who have been on the same train as the possible patient who has already travelled in Hong Kong territory.\nOutside China, cases of the new coronavirus have also been confirmed in South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and the United States. All the patients were in Wuhan. Several countries with direct or indirect air links to Wuhan are therefore systematically carrying out checks on passengers from areas considered to be at risk.\nYeah.\nThe Portuguese Government, for its part, warned on Wednesday that citizens travel to China and surrounding areas to learn about the evolution of the virus and recommended that tourists and residents register with or register at the consulate, according to the Lusa Agency.\n"Travellers, in particular those travelling to China and neighbouring regions, are recommended to be duly informed of developments and to remain vigilant with regard to reports published on the portals of the Directorate-General for Health, from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organisation", it warns the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the portal of Portuguese communities.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIn Brazil, authorities are investigating a suspicious case in Minas Gerais, advancing the Globo news portal G1. According to a note released by the State Department of Mining Health, the possible patient, a 35-year-old Brazilian woman, has returned from Shanghai to 18th January. While ensuring that she was not in the Wuhan region, the woman had respiratory symptoms compatible with the disease and was transported to the Menezes State Hospital in Belo Horizonte, where she is under observation and waiting for tests to validate or rule out infection with the new coronavirus.\nW\n'

'888888,0,Dracula\'s companion, bloodsucking night warmers, and now also dangerous virus seekers, who are to blame for the Coronavirus outbreak in China. The image of the bats has received another crack when genetic analysis of the new pathogen with the provisional name 2019-nCoV revealed: It is 88 percent related to a virus that treats under horseshoe noses (The Lancet: Lu et al. 2020). Bats, flying dogs and their relatives are particularly popular in Germany. Many people have been campaigning for decades for the protection of the 25-species native to us, almost a third of which are considered endangered or threatened with extinction.\nIt is not until the current coronavirus epidemic that bats are held accountable when an animal-borne pathogen spreads among humans. Fleas are considered to be a popular reservoir for viruses, i.e. the viruses are dormant in them and waiting for their chance to spread across species boundaries. When the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) also caused the first outbreak of the Coronavirus (Mers-CoV) in the year 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula, it was dromedars that transmitted the new pathogen to humans. But bats must have infected the camels.\nThe Nipah virus, which affected pig farmers for the first time in Malaysia, can also be traced back to bats: the farmers were infected by their pigs, who had eaten fruit again, on which feces and urine were glued by flying dogs. It is precisely this interplay of different species as hosts of viruses that divides scientists into at least two camps: some stress that the viruses originated from bats. The others focus on the fact that it was camels and pigs that transmitted the diseases to humans.\nYeah. Ultimately, the causal question remains one of the interpretations: is the type of causator of an epidemic that originally harbored the virus? Or the one who passed it on to humans?\nMost viruses have hosts beyond species boundaries. They are constantly changing, exchanging heritage among themselves and learning new things: Thus, a pathogen that first only affects birds can, through mutations, acquire the ability to enter human cells, so an animal disease becomes a disease for humans. When that happens, scientists talk about zoonosis. The further mankind enters the habitat of animals, the higher the likelihood that new zoonoses will emerge. People blush forests, hunt and eat wild animals or seek adventure in the wilderness as tourists. Rather, they come into contact with infected animals and stick to them. Similarly, in a wildlife market in Wuhan, the epidemic with the new Coronavirus may have begun.\nWhen the inheritance of the new pathogen was sequenced a few weeks after the outbreak, it turned out to be 88 percent equal to the two Coronavirus species found for the first time in bats. It is clear that this pathogen originated from the bat,"says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine.\n"I don\'t want to deny that the virus could have come from a bat at any time," says renowned bat researcher Paul Racey of Aberdeen University in Scotland.\nYeah. But he is a representative of the second group of researchers, who seems to be much more relevant to a completely different question: What kind of animal has the new virus ultimately transmitted to humans?\nBats are an order of mammals that, in the classical nomenclature, divide into the subordinates of flying dogs (Megachiroptera) and bats (Microchiroptera).\nRecent genetic analyses have shown, however, that the hoof-nosed species originally attributed to bats are more closely related to flying dogs. This is why zoologists nowadays distinguish bats from a new subsection, the yinterochiroptera: in turn, they include flying dogs and horseshoe-nosed (Rhinolophoidea).\nBats are usually nocturnal and can be spatially oriented by ultrasound. Most bats are smaller than flying dogs and feed mostly on insects. Flying dogs are called that because their head looks like a dog\'s. They are found mainly in the tropics and subtropes, where they feed mainly on fruit or nectar. In contrast to bats, flying dogs tend to orient themselves optically rather than over echo waves. Huffin-like species owe their name to a small patch of skin between the upper lip and the forehead, which is shaped like a Hufeisen. They feed, like bats, mainly on insects.\nBats are suspected to be the natural host of various viruses that can also make people sick: Ebola, Nipah, Hendra and Marburg as well as the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In addition, researchers found similarities between the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and two virus strains found in bats.\nYeah.\nFor Racey, there would be clear evidence that the pathogen has passed directly from a bat or a flying dog to humans only if researchers could prove to a bat that it eliminates 2019-nCoV directly, so it actually spreads the virus. There is no such proof so far. The fact that two strands of viruses are similar in their heritage is not enough for bat researchers to blame the bats with their more than 1.400-known species alone for a new outbreak. After the rodents, they formed the most species-rich order of mammals, and were often targeted because of their large spread.\nAccording to Racey, it may be good that the new Coronavirus has long since passed from one bat to another. This intermediary could then have passed the agent on to humans, for example at the wildlife and fish market in Wuhan. What kind of animal this could be is still unclear." We don\'t know which animals were on the market,"Racey says. Also Virologist Schmidt-Chanasit does not rule out that there was an intermediate host, i.e. animal species between bats and humans. But it is clear to him: the bat is the origin of the new Coronavirus. And whoever is the unknown landlord is being researched intensively.\nBut that is precisely what zoologists criticise: that all zoonoses are always researched until the bat appears at the origin of the infection chain. This is because not all potential species carrying viruses would be investigated equally intensively, says Merlin Tuttle, bat shooters and zoologists from the USA. Bats are easy to catch, Tuttle knows from his own experience: you set a trap at the entrance of a cave and wait, until the animals fly in." It would be much harder to catch thirty cobras than thirty bats,"says the researcher\nYeah. The virologist Schmidt-Chanasit understands the argument, but says that you can argue the whole thing in the other direction: "If you catch more bats, you might find a virus that matches the new Coronavirus to 99 percent."\nWhether Nipah, Sars or Mers: Bats are considered to be the original hearth for many viruses that can infect humans (trends in microbiology: Brook & Dobson, 2015). Often they carry the pathogens in the body without getting sick themselves. Why this is so, there are different theories about it: many have something to do with bats consuming extremely much energy while flying, which could also affect their immune system. It could, for example, result in their bodyguards not fighting viruses with full force but tolerating them by various means. This would also explain why the animals themselves do not get sick but can pass on the pathogens (Emerging Infectious Diseases: O\'Shea et al., 2014). However, the exact mechanism has not yet been clarified.\nIt is at least clear that bats and flying dogs are "an incredibly rich group of mammals", says Fabian Leendertz, who is researching pathogenic microorganisms at the Robert Koch Institute of Epidemiology. And the more species there are, the higher the likelihood that the animals will host a greater variety of microbes. There are also very large bat populations that are a perfect reservoir for viruses. Individual species of flying dogs or bats do not necessarily have to be more mature than other animals. However, their diversity may make them frequent carriers. Researchers from the EcoHealth Alliance, a private research facility in New York, investigated 754 mammalian species and found that, overall, bats harbour more zoonotic viruses than any other mammalian species investigated (Nature: Olival et al., 2017)\nYeah.\nInter-owner or co-owner: the spread of the viruses is not the fault of the bat anyway. For nature does not know the principle of guilt. Seeing them as the cause may be right on the principle of causality, but it is too short-sighted. Voigt says, instead of pointing the finger at animals at any new pathogen emerging among humans, people should rather rethink their own behaviour towards wild animals. Wildlife plays a major role in transmitting viruses from animals to humans. Many zoonotic outbreaks, however, are not even due to people hunting large wild animals like monkeys in the jungle, Leendertz says. Instead, they are targeting so-called cultural successors, for example rats, bats and flying dogs that are in the vicinity of human habitations. At the same time, it is difficult to condemn such hunting practices on a global scale: hunting is an ancient tradition in many regions and is regarded as an important source of food. One problem is also the markets where people buy and sell wild animals. There, dead and living animals are offered in the narrowest space, people rush through the small alleys, everything mixes and mixes: a perfect place for a virus to spread quickly.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory\nYeah. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection.\nYeah. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nFledermaus researchers such as Racey and Tuttle fear that branding the flying dogs and bats as viral vectors will further worsen the relationship between them and humans." If bats are considered to be the cause of Ebola and other viruses, no one will accept a bat in their own garden anymore,"says Tuttle. Recently he was called by the owner of an apartment complex: a bat flew into one of the apartments, the inhabitants are now afraid to have infected the animal with a disease." The current media reports on the connection between the Coronavirus and bats have certainly fuelled the story,"Tuttle says\nYeah. Although Hufeisennasen may have played a role in the case of the new Coronavirus: here in Europe it is very unlikely that people will infect bats with a dangerous virus, says Christian Voigt, who is researching bats at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research. In Europe, bats could only transmit rabies. But this risk is also rather small: according to the Robert Koch Institute, the last rabies-related rabies-related case in Europe 2002 occurred in Scotland.\nThroughout the discussion about animals as vectors of disease, it is often forgotten how important they are to agriculture and nature worldwide, and what role they play in different ecosystems worldwide. Some flying dogs, but also few bats, pollinate just like bees and other useful crops. As insect eaters, our native bat species keep the pests in check. But not a few are now threatened with extinction. In this situation, the batsmen from the USA and Europe fear that an image of virus-spreading could further harm the animals: not only because then perhaps fewer people will donate for the protection of these animals than for sweet pandas or seal babies. It is also because they fear that bats could be systematically fought like rats or pigeons in the city. With all the excitement surrounding the origin of the new Coronavirus, the world should not lose sight of the global dramatic species death. Well, cursing bats doesn\'t protect you from any disease.\n'
"888888,0,The new crown epidemic is a crisis that Xi Jinping's abnormal system can anticipate.\nThe columnist of the echo commentary reporter analyzed the institutional factors of the epidemic crisis, and concluded that whether Wuhan pneumonia or the previous Hongkong's Anti China war is a crisis that Xi Jinping can expect. The new coronavirus has blocked China's economy, killing hundreds of people and infecting thousands of others, the article wrote. But his other consequence is the damage to the credibility of China's technocratic system. The operation of the CPC lacks transparency, but it can still be trusted and obeyed by the Chinese people because it is efficient. In the economic sphere, it makes Chinese people rich in a generation's time, and it shows this efficiency in all other fields such as public health. This efficiency is the foundation of political power. In the face of the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, the Chinese government has been delayed for seven weeks. The author of this article points out that the main reason for denying the epidemic is the anti anomaly system established by Xi Jinping since taking office. Since 2012, Xi Jinping has accelerated the transformation of China's political economy, focusing on consumption and high technology. In the political field, it used the anti-corruption movement to control the party in its own hands, set up a system of personal rights that did not exist after Mao Zedong, and even wrote Xi's thoughts into the constitution. He abolished the term of office of the supreme leader and completely changed Deng Xiaoping's performance promotion system since 1978. Nowadays, the most important standard of official promotion is obedience. The pneumonia crisis in Wuhan shows that, at least in Wuhan, obedient officials control everything. The article quotes the writer Xu Kaizhen's point of view in an interview with the New York Times that the pressure of the anti-corruption movement makes the leaders of the bureaucracy, including those at the top, at a loss and only care about their positions. They can't take action without knowing the opinions of their superiors. The article wrote that Xi Jinping himself also admitted in February 3rd that the new crown epidemic situation is a major test of the ability to govern the country. But the author of this article points out that the crisis can be expected, the new crown epidemic is only one, but not the last major accident. Another major accident was in Hong Kong. If Xi Jinping's regime had not been more and more autocratic, there would not be a campaign of resistance on such a scale for young people in Hongkong. At the beginning of Hong Kong's sovereignty return, people also hoped that Deng Xiaoping style system would gradually open up. Hong Kong is gradually moving towards democracy. People in Hong Kong can retain their most important freedom\n。 But the new Mao Zedong changed the judicial system of Hong Kong, which shows that instead of Beijing moving closer to Hong Kong, it is the opposite. Young people in Hong Kong have been adamantly and courageously rejecting this prospect for seven months. The author predicts that China is still moving towards other accidents.\nJapan in the forefront of Wuhan pneumonia crisis\nIn fact, many cities in different provinces, large and small, have begun to take various measures to block the cities themselves, but not to make too much publicity. According to the report, at least 80 million people are estimated to be under observation in isolation across China, but the authorities avoid disclosing information.\nThe Princess Diamond, a luxury cruise ship, was stranded in Japan after several new cases of coronavirus infection were found. A reporter from the Figaro newspaper in Tokyo introduced the isolated life of 3700 tourists on the cruise ship, and pointed out that Japan was already in the front line of the epidemic crisis from various perspectives. Japan is the country with the largest number of infections outside China, with 45 cases as of Thursday night; Japan may also be the country with the most economic impact. On the one hand, Japan's economy mainly relies on exports to China, while China's economy has been in crisis; on the other hand, the impact of the epidemic on Japan's domestic market has also emerged. Every year during the Spring Festival, Japanese stores and restaurants are crowded with Chinese tourists. According to a document issued by BNP Paribas, from the SARS epidemic in 2003 to 2019, the number of Chinese tourists to Japan increased 21 times, accounting for one third of the total number of Japanese foreign tourists. What's worse, Japan has been preparing for the Tokyo Olympics in July for many years, hoping that the Olympics will become an opportunity to show the world success and prosperity. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said whether the Tokyo Olympics will be rescheduled.\nCDC: new coronavirus is unlikely to spread in the EU\nThe Figaro newspaper also published an article on the work of the European Center for Disease Control and prevention, headquartered in Stockholm. The center has no laboratory. Its main function is to collect information, coordinate the epidemic prevention and control efforts of member countries, and observe the spread and research of 56 infectious diseases in the world. Julien beaut é, a virus expert at the center, told the paper that because the center continues to track and observe the spread of various infectious diseases, they have long found unknown pneumonia in China. Chinese officials have only since confirmed the news. But he also said that most of the infectious diseases they followed were known viruses, and that the medical community understood the incubation period and the infection period\n。 But they don't know whether the new coronavirus is just human to human transmission, and whether there are still active animal infectious sources in China? Which factors may lead to increased mortality, asymptomatic infection can infect others, and so on. Now the only thing that is certain is that the epidemic is still spreading. Although the academic community still lacks a complete understanding of this, the center believes that the epidemic is unlikely to spread in the EU.\n"

"888888,0,\nPeople the world over are anxious and scared because of the coronavirus outbreak, and Indians are no exception\nThere are three ways of looking at how a person responds to a situation like this. One is on an individual basis. The second is on the community level, and the third is on the health system.\nAll these three factors interact together and work on a person to behave in a certain way.\nEven people who are absolutely normal, when faced with something like this over which you have no control and which disrupts your lifecycle, daily routine and social life completely, can become depressed and anxious.\nWe have the evidence that during the initial outbreak in Wuhan in China, more than 50 per cent of the population suffered from depression and one-third of them had moderate to severe anxiety; anxieties about themselves and their families.\nThere was generally an increased level of anxiety.\nIt is mostly the uncertainty of the whole situation. The disease is pandemic, and the virus is spreading fast. So far there is no treatment available.\nSo, when you do not know much about the virus which spreads really fast, and you do not have a vaccine, the general anxiety level of the population increases tremendously.\nIn such a situation, people who are vulnerable psychologically are more likely to be upset.\nIt is normal. Even normally healthy people who are not exposed to covid-19 become worried and anxious when they develop a cold and cough. This can be distressing.\nWhen I said those who are vulnerable, I meant those who are already depressed or anxious, and it aggravates.\nFor example, these people may wash their hands continuously.\nIn the case of this virus, the really vulnerable are the old people above the age of 70. The epidemiological studies have shown that the virus seems to cause mortality in older people with prevailing health conditions like hypertension and diabetes.\nMany elderly people are on ACE inhibitors (medicine to control hypertension) and if they contract the virus, they are more likely to have problems.\nWhen you are older, the tendency to be anxious and depressed is more, and it will be even more in situations like these where you have no control.\nChildren who do not know much about the virus also can get anxious because of the situation they are forced into and also by picking up news from here and there.\nThey also see their parents being anxious which makes them behave in such a way that parents will find it difficult to control them.\nIt can make or break the family.\nThey can develop more bonding as they can't go out and are forced to interact with each other. In a fairly stable family, it can foster bonding and they may enjoy the togetherness.\nBut if the family is already wobbly and discordant, when they lose the space which they use to have is gone, there may be more flare-ups. This can be more damaging.\nSo, it entirely depends on the family's pre-existing situation.\nYes, we have similar kind of statistics from all epidemics that the anxiety level, depressive level and worries of people goes up.\nNo. That was different because in the case of HIV, the spread happened only when people were in contact. So, people were more relaxed about the HIV virus. They knew that only if they had physical contact would they contract the virus. So, HIV did not create this kind of anxiety.\nBut covid-19 is not a contact virus; it is a droplet virus.\nEven if you have not met a person who has covid-19, if you touch the glass he has used or the railing or the lift button he has touched, and then you touch your eyes, nose or mouth, you get the virus.\nIt means you do not know from where you are getting the virus.\nWhen the environment itself causes danger, there will be more anxiety.\nI think so. This is a pandemic. HIV was an epidemic. So also Ebola, and they were able to contain it fast. We were able to come out with a vaccine for SAARS and H1N1 quickly.\nNo other virus has reached the scale in which this is in. What is worrying about covid-19 is the rapidity of its spread.\nIf you look at the RO number, that is how many people each infected person infects, it is the highest in the case of covid-19.\nThe RO number for SAARS was 2 while it is 6 in the case of covid-19. It means each covid-19 infected person is capable of infecting six other people.\nI won't say this is the deadliest virus.\nYes, it spreads very fast, but if you look at the mortality rate, it is only 2% to 3% of the people who contract it. But it is highly contagious.\nI would say, you should face it calmly.\nThe more anxious you are, the more stressed you are, your immunity level comes down, and you are likely to pick up the virus.\nYou should follow precautions, but you should not panic.\nSocial isolation itself can create panic among people. So, stay connected. Unlike 20, 30 years ago, today you can stay connected with people.\nI also would say the biggest creator of anxiety and panic is social media because the kind of fake news that gets circulated. That's why WHO said, please avoid listening to fake news.\nListen only to accurate and not falsified numbers, figures, localities, etc put out by the government.\nDefinitely. Anything that makes you feel better and calm, is advised.\nI would say there are better methods of tracking than stamping. It was like in the Nazi times, you stamped people!\nWhat happens is, when you so something like this, a person feels isolated from the community. When s/he goes out, the entire community may pounce on him.\nSo, s/he feels rejected by the community. This will scar the person. This can also generate xenophobia.\nWhen you have the technology, there are better ways of tracking a person.\nAlso, make the quarantine places reasonably comfortable for people, provide access to their families, and there should be enough guards to see that they don't escape from the facility.\nAbsolutely. Unfortunately, the global estimates say the world may go into a deep recession by July. That will have more impact on young people than older people. The young people will be anxious about job losses, pay cuts, etc.\nWe know the economic consequences will be terrible, but we do not know how terrible it will be.\nThe government should keep the people informed of the situation every day with up-to-date figures, up-to-date resources and correct news so that they don't listen to fake news. Then the anxiety level comes down.\nNot knowing the real picture causes more anxiety.\nAs of now, it seems they are doing the right way.\nOne thing India has done well which other countries have not done is spreading awareness through the telephone. With this, the general level of awareness has gone up. It is a very positive thing.\nBut they should be testing more people. I think more people need to be tested than what is being done now. We need more testing centres. For example, what South Korea has done. They even had drive-in testing centres.\nAs a psychiatrist, I will say, take precautions, but don't panic. Because panic will reduce your ability to fight the virus.\nHave a good routine; eat well, sleep well, exercise, go out for small walks and maintain social contact.\n"
'888888,0,The number of deaths caused by the new coronavirus in Wuhei province, where the city of Wuhan, epicenter of the virus, rose this Thursday to 204. This new data increases the total number of deaths worldwide to 212. According to the Wuhei health authorities, the number of infected people in Chinese territory has also increased to 5806, aggregating 9320 cases of infection worldwide. 98 There are confirmed cases of infection outside China in at least 18 countries. There was also confirmation that the virus has already reached all Chinese provinces, including Tibet.\nThis Thursday, at least 6000 people were detained inside a cruise ship off Italy because they suspected that a couple might be infected with the new coronavirus, reported to Reuters. On suspicion were two passengers arriving from Macao to board the Smeralda Coast, which was docked at the port of Savona, and presenting flu-like symptoms. However, it confirmed the Italian Government at the beginning of the evening that the tests on the couple were negative.\nAlthough no case was detected on the cruise ship, Italy confirmed two cases on Thursday in the new coronavirus country and suspended all flights to or from China despite opposition to the restrictions on flights from the World Health Organisation (WHO). "As in other countries, we have two confirmed cases of the new coronavirus. These are two Chinese tourists who arrived a few days ago [Italy],"said the Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, quoted by the agency France-Presse, adding that the decision to close the Italian airspace to flights"to and from"to China was"as a precaution".\nItaly is the fourth European country to confirm cases of viral infection after France, Germany and Finland\nYeah. The new coronavirus has reached at least 18 countries in addition to China, including India and the Philippines, which have recorded the first cases in the last few hours.\nThe new coronavirus has also arrived in India: there is at least one positive case detected in the state of Kerala, according to a statement from the Indian health authorities. The Philippines has also confirmed its first case.\nIn both cases, infected people had travelled from the Wuhan province, the epicenter of the outbreak. In the Filipino case, the infected woman is 38-year-old and of Chinese origin. In the Indian case, the infected student was studying at the University of Wuhan, although it is not known when he returned from China to India. The student is currently under quarantine.\nAccording to the Indian Ministry of Health, all hospitals and health centers are prepared for a possible outbreak and airports are monitoring symptoms (such a s fever, cough or breathing difficulties) in all incoming passengers. The Indian Government is also planning two flights to repatriate citizens in Hubei Province, China. Only those citizens who are healthy will be transported.\nIt is not the only country to choose to repatriate its citizens. Japan and the US have already sent chartered flights to China in order to withdraw nationals from their countries. Australia is preparing to do the same and has already announced that the rescued nationals will be isolated on Christmas Island in quarantine. The arrival of planes from South Korea and the United Kingdom was delayed by the lack of authorisation from the Chinese authorities, writes The Guardian.\nIn Europe, the second Hi fly chartered flight to repatriate 350 people from several European states left Beja Airport at 10am this Thursday. This flight is expected to bring back the 17 Portuguese who have asked to leave China\nYeah. Italy and Germany also independently announced two flights\nIn response to the outbreak, Russia has chosen to close its border with China, reporting the South China Morning Post. Nor will any electronic visas be issued to Chinese nationals wishing to visit Russia from this Thursday.\n"We must do everything to protect our population," said Prime Minister Mishustin, who also advises that all trips to China should be avoided.\nThe Macao Government also decided this Thursday to postpone the resumption of the lessons. The new date will be announced one week before the reopening of "higher and non-higher education institutions (secondary, primary and child education) and the resumption of activities in the"private complementary educational support centres and in continuing education institutions".\nWithout giving a date, Kong Ngai, head of the education department in the semi-autonomous region of China, added that during suspension schools must "use remote means" to work and accompany students. Even cross-border pupils "do not need to go to Macao" and "should stay home until school starts again". Schools should "cooperate" with the Government of Macao and avoid crowding people and reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.\nOn the other hand, Macao\'s health authorities have stated that the most recent cases of coronavirus in Zhuhai are people who have been in the territory and the routes of these patients are being checked. According to the Chinese National Health Commission, 26 confirmed cases of infection with the new coronavirus have been confirmed to date. Zhuhai is located in Guangdong Province (South China), the second with the largest number of cases in the country: 354\nYeah.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) decided this Thursday to classify the coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international interest, the most important signal the WHO can give the world. In order to declare a public health emergency of international interest (PHEIC) the situation under examination must meet three criteria: it must be an extraordinary event, with a risk of high public health risk from other countries and requiring a coordinated international response. This is the sixth time that the WHO has used this global alert instrument.\n"In recent days the spread of the virus, especially in some countries and especially by the transmission of humans-to-humans, is worrying us," said the Director-General of OMS Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday, quoted by the BBC. In Germany, Vietnam and Japan, there are reports of people who have become infected without ever travelling to China: only by contact with other infected people. "Even though the numbers outside China are relatively small, they have the potential to cause a much larger outbreak," he added.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAccording to a study published in the scientific journal The Lancet, which analyses at least 99 cases of the new coronavirus treated at Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan between 1 and 20 in January, at least 46 people had been on the Wuhan fish market. The average age of the infected is 55,5 years and most of them were male. The most common symptoms are fever and cough. At least 11 of the infected in this hospital died from organ failure.

'888888,0,BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, sending markets into a tailspin over fears of a global pandemic even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities.\nWhile health experts have expected limited outbreaks beyond China, the rapid acceleration of cases in Italy going from three on Friday to 220 on Monday is concerning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.\nJust as China put cities on lockdown, Italian authorities sealed off the worst-affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases.\nShops are shut, bars are closed and people speak to each other from a safe distance in northern Italy.\nMarkets are nervous that Europe could experience disruptions similar to China, where air traffic has been disrupted and global supply chains rattled for everything from medicine to cars to smartphones.\nBut China’s actions, especially in Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward, urging the rest of the world to learn the lesson of acting fast.\n“They’re at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in,” he said.\nThe surge of cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets as investors fled to safe havens. European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018. All three indexes closed down more than 3% after notching record highs last week on optimism the coronavirus would not seriously hurt global economies.\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index , jumped to a one-year high.\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word “pandemic” did yet not fit the facts.\n“We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,” he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.\nThe epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the WHO said.\nDr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies program, told reporters it was still possible to contain the virus and that it might appear each year like the flu.\n“The virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic,” he said in Geneva on Monday. “And at this point, it is not possible to say which of those realities is going to happen.”\nIn the United States, the White House is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading virus, a White House spokesman and an administration source said on Monday. Politico and the Washington Post had reported the Trump administration may request $1 billion.\nLiang Wannian of China’s National Health Commission said while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue.\nExcluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20.\nOverall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier. That took the total number of cases to 77,150, while the death toll rose by 150 to 2,592.\nThere was a measure of relief for the world’s second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections.\nOutside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to some 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.\nSouth Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833. Many are in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, which became more isolated with Asiana Airlines (020560.KS) and Korean Air (003490.KS) suspending flights there until next month.\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran, where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected. Most of the Iran  infections were in the Shi’ite Muslim holy city of Qom.\nA WHO team is due in Iran on Tuesday.\nJapan had 773 cases as of late Sunday, mostly on the cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo.\nIn South Korea, drone footage here showed what appeared to be hundreds of people queuing up outside a Daegu supermarket to buy face masks.\n(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus here)\n'
'888888,0,The Chinese state press released a speech this Saturday by President Xi Jinping indicating that the Chinese leader was aware of the potential gravity of the outbreak of the new coronavirus weeks before the population was alerted to the issue.\nAt the beginning of the outbreak, Xi Jinping adopted a stance that many considered to be ineffective, fuelling a wave of criticism about the response to the crisis of the Chinese Government, which forced him this week to come forward with the fight against the health crisis, to unleash a purge on the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) in Hubei Province, where the new virus arose and initiate a reform in the way China deals with health emergencies.\nIn an unprecedented way, Chinese citizens, forced into quarantine of gigantic proportions, tens of millions of people are confined to their homes, or subjected to control measures severely restricting their movement or contact with other people, call for more transparency in the state, more information on what if it\'s going on.

It was on that day that the Beijing authorities confirmed that Covid-19 was passing between humans, when alarm began to take on a new tone.\nXi Jinping\'s advisors will have thought that the disclosure of this debate will show that the Chinese President has been aware of the crisis from the beginning, and they hope to dispel criticism because he has not publicly appeared to lead the actions against the emergency, which has already killed 1665 in a total of 68.500 infections. "The general tone of the speech seems defensive", he told the New York Times Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California (USA). "He wants to change the narrative, which so far has been very unfavorable to Chinese lieutenants."\n"I have followed at all times the spread of the epidemic and the progress in efforts to contain it, constantly issuing orders orally and instructions," Xi Jinping said in the speech quoted by the New York Times.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the most profound works of the publiYeah.\nThe Chinese executive now faces several criticisms and public discontent, which became acute earlier this month after the death of Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor, 34-year-old, who issued warnings about the new virus and was arrested for spreading rumours and forced to sign a document unfolding, and who died. after contracting Covid-19.\nA few hours after the announcement of the speech, China announced a drop in the new Covid-19 cases for the third consecutive day.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON - The U.S. State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States on Friday to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, as tensions between the two global powers over the outbreak intensified.  \n David Stillwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very "stern representation" to China\'s ambassador Cui Tiankai, a State Department official said, adding that Beijing\'s envoy was "very defensive."  \n The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in "starting a global pandemic and not telling the world."  \n "Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous. We wanted to put the government on notice we won\'t tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world."  \n Defence Department Spokeswoman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter on Friday that "the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 blaming U.S. service members. #ChinaPropaganda"  \n The virus, also called COVID-19, has infected 138,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,000.  \n China\'s embassy did not respond to requests for comment.  \n Despite the signs of tension, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Beijing on Friday for its "data sharing".  \n Asked by a reporter during a White House news conference about "odd narratives" being offered by some Chinese officials, Trump appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  \n Trump, who in a national address this week called the outbreak a "foreign virus" that started in China, added: "They know where it came from, we all know where it came from."  \n Tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter on Thursday.  \n "When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!" Zhao tweeted in English.  \n The episode is the latest in an increasing war of words between Washington and Beijing, whose already strained ties over issues including trade, intellectual property rights and press freedom have further been tested by the virus outbreak.  \n The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, pummelling financial markets, halting industry, bringing some flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sports events and concerts.  \n Zhao\'s comments came days after Robert O\'Brien, the U.S. national security adviser, said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing.  \n Wuhan was ground zero for the outbreak, which the World Health Organization this week labelled a pandemic. It has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide, including nearly 81,000 in mainland China, and killed more than 5,000 people.  \n Beijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has complained that the U.S. response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.  \n He and several other U.S. politicians have angered Beijing by referring to the "Wuhan virus."

This is the first time that Japan has issued a "three-level" warning with a lower severity since adopting four levels of infectious disease risk information in 2015.\n26, the Ministry of health and labour said that more than 40 year old Chinese men who had visited Wuhan from Japan had contracted the new coronavirus and had pneumonia symptoms. The man is now in hospital in Aichi county. Although he has a fever, his condition is stable at present. This is the fourth case found in Japan.\nJapan\'s Ministry of land and communications held an important meeting in the province to prevent the expansion of the new form of coronavirus infection on 24 April, confirming the need to implement the border crossings in airports and harbors. "There are 2080 flights from China to Japan, about 400000 seats," said the Minister of state communications, Chiyu Yijia. There are 15 cruises, about 35000 people coming. " Since January 27, the overseas group travel industry of China has all stopped overseas travel, which has a great impact on Japan\'s tourism industry. Chinese overseas travel to Japan accounts for about one-third of all overseas travel. Hotels around Japan have received notice of check-out. Department stores also tend to rely on foreign tourists to generate income in recent years, some of which face 100% of foreign tourists The Chinese are the biggest customers in the store, accounting for 80% - 90% of the sales. During the Spring Festival, it is a concentrated sales period. In 2019, the consumption of foreign tourists is 481.3 billion yen, of which 36.8% are tourists from mainland China, accounting for 1771.8 billion yen. However, this new pneumonia epidemic will be the second heavy blow to Japan\'s tourism economy after Japan\'s relations with South Korea worsened and South Korean tourists greatly reduced. Japanese businesses are sighing for this, hoping that the epidemic will subside as soon as possible\n。\nJapan has now decided to designate the new coronavirus pneumonia as "designated infection", requiring all Chinese passengers arriving at the airport to have their own cough and fever and accept infrared temperature sensors.\nKyoto Prefecture and Kyoto City are popular tourist destinations for Chinese tourists. Kyoto and Beijing have stepped up their vigilance with the emergence of new coronavirus pneumonia cases in Japan. In a 24-day interview with a reporter from a governor of the Kyoto government, governor Longjun Nishiya pointed out that he would appeal to the residents of the government for the prevention strategies of routine hand washing and wearing masks, and that all aspects of the infection of the pneumonia should be "prevented before it happens", and that the infection should not be allowed to expand, but should be responded with a sense of tension. The "Brocade market" in the central Beijing area, a popular market among foreigners, mainly sells traditional vegetables and fresh fish in Kyoto, with more than 120 stores in a row. Jinshizhenxing street trade union appealed to shops in the market to take measures to prevent respiratory tract infection, such as wearing masks and washing hands frequently.\nDue to the warm climate, Japan\'s zuoka county is close to China geographically, and it is also a favorite place for Chinese tourists to visit in winter. Starting from the large-scale continuous holiday of Spring Festival on the 24th, there are many airport and accommodation facilities for Chinese tourists to visit Japan in zuoka county. Zuoka has strengthened the prevention measures against infection. The notice urging tourists from China to fill in the health status registration card will be issued from the 25th after the flyer is posted at zoga airport.\nThe aircraft under the jurisdiction of Fukuoka quarantine office, including the zoga airport, has posted flyers since January 8. No matter whether they have been in Wuhan or not, if they are taking cough medicine and antipyretics, they also need to report to the quarantine officer.\nIn Tokyo, tourist attractions such as the Tokyo district\'s shallow grass culture and tourism center in Taitung have posted leaflets on new coronavirus pneumonia, and visitors who wish to seek medical treatment because of poor physical condition will confirm their stay experience before visiting Japan.\nOn the 25 day, the Tokyo metropolitan government issued a new announcement on pneumonia related information on the website of the infectious disease information center in Tokyo. It said that in order to strengthen the prevention and control of new coronavirus infection in Wuhan and other cities, effectively prevent the spread of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection, and ensure the health and safety of Japanese tourists and Japanese citizens, the general infectious diseases were introduced. Methods of prevention and disinfection, medical treatment methods of medical institutions, etc.\n'
'888888,0,Four continents have already reached the new Coronavirus: from China people have carried it to other parts of Asia, Australia, Europe and North America. In Africa, however, it has not yet arrived. But what if? The pathogen t hat has already killed 500-people and infected tens of thousands of people would hit countries here whose health systems are as weak as perhaps anywhere else in the world. Worst case scenario, it could mean an epidemic of hundreds of thousands of infected and thousands of dead. Because many regions in sub-Saharan Africa already have major problems today: epidemics of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis and an increase in chronic diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure are not only weakening people, but are overburdening countries where hospitals, doctors, nurses and medical care are lacking.\nEven if they struggle with numbers and predictions, many experts are very afraid of this scenario. Meeting of the Executive Board of the World Health Organisation on 3rd. In February, the mood among the African Member States was very tense, officials say. And John Nkengasong, who heads the African Union\'s only three years ago, said TIME ONLINE between two telephone conferences: "We are facing an unprecedented danger."\nEven in the Sars epidemic 2003, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa had largely been spared, with only South Africa registering a single case. With the new Coronavirus, however, no one should hope that it will go so smoothly: the links between China and many African states have become too close. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese guest workers work on the African continent, thousands of African students travel to China each year with a university scholarship\nYeah. Air traffic from Africa to China and back has been declining over the past ten years.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th\nYeah. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nYeah.\nMany countries of the continent have strong economic relations with China. Kenya and Ethiopia, for example. For Ethiopia, China is the most important economic partner with a trade volume of more than five billion US dollars. In Kenya, the Chinese government sponsored one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of the country, a high-speed train connecting the capital of Nairobi to the coastal metropolis of Mombasa. The train is part of the New Silk Road Initiative initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping 2013. China is investing billions of euros in infrastructure projects to build global trading bases.\nAnd last week, in both Ethiopia and Kenya, there were several Coronavirus suspected cases on the phone, says Michel Yao, who is responsible for emergency programs at the WHO Africa." We\'ve had many alarms,"says Yao. This is a good sign, however, because it shows that the monitoring systems worked in many places.\nBut is it true? Or have there been cases in individual African states for a long time that nobody has registered? A report published by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board at least found worldwide gaps in the preparation for epidemics and an investigation by the Center for Health Security of Johns Hopkins University showed that the worst prepared countries are found almost all in Africa. In fact, there is a shortage of everything: laboratories to detect pathogens, isolation rooms and personnel.\nBut first of all, in order to suffocate an epidemic in the germ, good reporting systems are needed. Because the faster cases are detected, the fewer people can infect the infected. John Nkengasong says the African Disease Protection Agency has already set up a task force to assist countries\nYeah. In addition, each country should have a rapid response force, and already today, all airports would be looking for infected people, with questionnaires and temperature scanners. Such a screening would be carried out anyway because of the outbreak of Ebola in Congo that has been going on for a year and a half.\nHowever, it is difficult to say how well these measures really work in the event of a coronation. It certainly also depends on which country in sub-Saharan Africa is dealing with the first cases of corona viruses. Some countries, such as Ghana or Nigeria, are better prepared than regions where war is raging and governments are unstable, such as South Sudan or the Central African Republic. There, for example, the virus is likely to have almost free circulation.\nAlso, finding new cases will not be easy, says Gerard Krause of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research: "In large parts of Africa, people think of malaria first if someone has a fever." So it is also a matter of training health professionals that in addition to diseases such as malaria, Lassa, Ebola and meningococcal meningitis could also hide the corona virus behind a fever.\nKrause has been helping to set up a system in Nigeria since 2017, and last but not least in Ghana, called Sormas. One must imagine it as a platform that connects all those involved in a health system digitally: the laboratory, the district doctor, the village health worker and the health authority. For example, if a health care worker suspects an infection with the new corona virus, deposits it on a tablet and takes a blood sample, explains Krause, different things happen at the same time: the laboratory is notified that a sample is on its way\nYeah. The health authorities and the district doctor receive an alert and the health care worker is instructed to isolate the suspect and search for people he was dealing with.\nIf we succeed in finding a suspect, the question remains as to how it will be confirmed. At the beginning of February, there were only two laboratories throughout Africa testing samples of patients on the 2019-nCoV virus. The evidence of a suspicious case in the Ivory Coast had to be sent to Europe first, said Michael Yao, TIME ONLINE. It took days to establish a false alarm. In the coming days, twelve laboratories in sub-Saharan Africa should be able to test for the new Coronavirus, Yao says. John Nkengasong assumes that he will soon be available in 15 to 20 countries.\nFinding patients quickly and then isolating them is even more important in much of Africa than elsewhere. Because most health systems in sub-Saharan Africa may be too weak to care for the sick in the event of a major corona virus outbreak. There are no surface quarantine stations with ventilation machines used in the event of severe pneumonia caused by the corona virus. In addition, there is a shortage of skilled workers in almost all countries of sub-Saharan Africa. While in Germany statistically approximately 42 doctors arrive at 10.000 people, in Ethiopia there is exactly one, in Somalia even only 0.2*.\nIn many countries, the most elementary is missing, says political scientist Ilona Kickbusch, who has advised the federal government on global health issues: "This already begins with the protection coat and medicines." Also, in many countries with weak health systems, there are logistical problems. Bringing respiratory masks into affected areas may take days, much too long for the contagious corona virus\nYeah.\nThe weakness of some health systems was also the main reason to call for an international health emergency, said the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on 30th. January: "We do not know what damage this virus can do if it spreads to a country with a weaker health system. We must act now to prepare for this possibility."\nJohn Nkengasong says: "I can only call on the international community to help African countries now, and not to wait until the continent is completely overwhelmed." An outbreak like in China would not stand up to the health systems of most states.\nThe Gates Foundation, which has been investing millions in global health for years, has already promised Nkengansong\'s authority four or five million euros to take action against the new Coronavirus. I got 05. In February, the Foundation then declared that it would invest another 90 million euros to combat the Coronavirus, approximately 18 million of which would go to African countries. Some African states, such as Sudan, requested 04. In February, at the meeting of the WHO Executive Board, explicitly asked for help. On the one hand, it was about training professionals for the prevention and treatment of the Coronavirus,"says Mathias Bonk of the Institute for Global Health in Berlin. And secondly, they need materials like test kits, masks and protective suits. Some of these problems are intended to resolve a strategy plan tailored specifically to the new Coronavirus presented by the WHO this week.\nJohn Nkengansong of the African Disease Protection Agency also spoke to the World Bank and asked the public health authorities of the USA and China for logistical assistance. It was precisely the Americans who helped in recent health crises in sub-Saharan Africa.\nYeah. But what if the US itself experiences a severe corona virus outbreak? This fear is also driving many people around at the moment: that the classical donor countries could be so busy with outbreaks of the virus that they are no longer helping.\nMichel Yao says the WHO emergency team is also in contact with non-governmental organisations such as the Red Cross and doctors without borders. In some places, if the virus reaches them, African states could benefit from such existing partnerships. In such cases, for example, Ebola treatment centres in the Congo could then be converted to places where people with a coronary virus infection are isolated and treated.\nHowever, Ilona Kickbusch also stresses that it needs not only money and supplies, but also a strategy to explain measures such as quarantine and isolation of patients to the people in the affected areas. In the past Ebola outbreaks this proved to be a problem: men in yellow protective suits, so it must be many villagers have depicted, came, brought healthy people and brought back dead. Of course, conspiracy theories emerged, making it even more difficult for treatment teams to gain the trust of the population.\nGerard Krause of the Helmholtz Institute for Infection Research is in contact with various African states. They are thinking about using their Sormas system, just like Ghana and Nigeria. There the system has already helped 2017 and 2018 to control an outbreak of monkey pox, says Krause. Even if it may be too late for the new Coronavirus, another epidemic with a new pathogen is bound to come. This should be prepared by an ever closer-knit Africa.\nRead all about the new Coronavirus on our topic page.\n*Correction note: Initially the text stated how many doctors on 10.000 people in the respective country are coming incorrectly\nYeah. This has been corrected.\n'

'888888,0,HONG KONG — The Covid-19 epidemic caused by the coronavirus will not end this year as the contagion has spread worldwide, a leading microbiologist from Hong Kong has said. \n Professor Yuen Kwok-yung from the University of Hong Kong, who advised authorities on control measures against the disease, said although the situation in mainland China and Hong Kong might improve in summer, there could be more imported cases from the southern hemisphere in winter. \n "We think the epidemic will probably not come to an end," Mr Yuen said on a pre-recorded television interview aired on Sunday (March 8). "There will be what we call reversed imported cases. In the beginning other countries feared us, now we fear them [for bringing in the virus]." \n He elaborated further in a reply to the Post later on Sunday that in his view, the epidemic would not end until a cheap and effective antiviral or vaccine became available or the majority of the population had contracted the virus and got natural immunity. \n Since late February, Covid-19 infections have jumped in South Korea, Italy and Iran, which are now the three countries with the highest number of cases outside China. On Sunday, it was reported that Italy would quarantine the entire Lombardy region with a population of some 10 million, after recording its biggest surge in daily cases, at 1,247, since the outbreak in the country began on Feb 21. \n As of Sunday evening, Hong Kong had 114 confirmed cases and three related deaths. \n Mr Yuen also urged people to avoid travelling at least until the end of the year. He pointed to two infections in Hong Kong that were linked to a recent tour group to India. Another woman in her 80s from the same group was also diagnosed with Covid-19 after returning to Vancouver, Canada. \n "When the epidemic is serious, avoid travelling to other places unless necessary," Mr Yuen said. \n He added that while the global spread of the virus had shifted the focus away from tightening border measures between Hong Kong and mainland China, it was too early to tell if the situation on the mainland would be "under control by April", as suggested by some experts there. \n Mr Yuen also said the virus, like most strains, had been mutating, but assured that for now there was no evidence to suggest it had become more deadly or easily transmitted. \n The key to fighting epidemics, Mr Yuen reiterated, started with personal hygiene. \n "If everyone washes his or her hand, wears a mask all the time and maintains social distancing, the risk of infection will be lowered. It\'s a matter of compliance," Mr Yuen said. \n "We cannot guard against the virus forever, but the longer we delay its spread, the higher the chances of getting a vaccine in time." \n In a separate interview also published on Sunday by mainland Chinese online media Caixin, Mr Yuen said his team and other scientists were developing a vaccine. He revealed that tests on mice showed no side effects, and successfully produced antibodies, but further procedures were required. \n "I believe it will be one year or 11/2 years until clinical applications," he was quoted as saying.

'888888,0,The Portuguese to be removed from Wuhan will be evaluated on arrival in Portugal to determine the risk of exposure to the new coronavirus and only then will any social isolation measures be taken, explained this Tuesday to Lusa the Director General for Health.\nFrance\'s health minister, Agnes Buzyn, said today that the French who are to be removed from this Chinese city, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV), who do not show symptoms will be kept in a place of confinement for 14 days, the estimated maximum duration of the incubation of the disease, to ensure they haven\'t been infected by the virus.\nAsked by Lusa about whether Portugal will take an identical measure, the Director-General for Health, Grace Freitas, said that it will not be so restrictive: what is usually done is the person\'s "epidemiological history".\n"The first thing we have to understand when they arrive is the risk that they may have contracted an infection. If the risk is too small no action is taken," he said.\nResponding that the Portuguese authorities are always reviewing risk-based procedures, the Director General for Health recalled the procedures adopted in the case of influenza A with the first cases that came from Mexico.\n"We asked people who came with asymptomatics, who may or may not be incubating the virus, to do voluntary social isolation," that is, to stay in a room alone and have minimal contact with people.\nBut, I stressed, "the initial story is that it will determine the risk and in the light of that risk it is that social isolation measures are advised".\n"If the Portuguese have already been in their homes in Wuhan for the past four days, had no contact with people or animals, were not exposed to anything, have no symptoms, there is no reason to place them in social isolation", said Grace Freitas\nYeah.\nFor the head of the Portuguese health authority, these\'common sense measures should be taken\'.\nHe also recalled that a person only goes to the hospital if they have symptoms. However, it was linked, the authorities keep in touch with these people to make sure they have no symptoms.\n"So far, the Portuguese protocol is thus and follows the guidelines of the World Health Organisation", he concluded.\nPortugal has already activated public health devices due to the coronavirus from China and has alerted St John\'s Hospital in Porto, Curry Cabral and Stephania in Lisbon.\nIn Portugal, established protocols for gender situations have been activated, by reinforcing the Health Service 24 line, by means of number 8002424, and the medical support line, for screening and preventing people from filling the health centres and emergency rooms of hospitals in the event of possible contagion.\nSome countries, such as the United States, Japan, France, Germany and Portugal, are preparing with the Chinese authorities to withdraw their citizens from Wuhan, where there are also two dozen Portuguese.\nThe Portuguese Government has already announced that it wants to remove by air the Portuguese detained in Wuhan.\nChina raised to 106 dead and more than four.000 infected the balance of the new coronavirus detected at the end of the year in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (center).\nInfected persons may transmit the disease during the incubation period, which takes between one day and two weeks, without the virus being detected.\n'
"888888,0,In recent days has made headlines worldwide a condition called coronavirus, because the virus that causes it, which, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), can cause various diseases in humans and animals, they can go from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Disease Prevention, coronaviruses are common throughout the world, they can infect and sicken people, however, the new outbreak is called 2019-nCoV and was identified on January 9, 2020.\nAccording to Telesur, it is believed that the virus spread from a seafood market in China's Wuhan city, but authorities identified cases that had no contact with that place.\nBoth China and the WHO have warned of the ease of spread of this disease, which, according to officials of the Asian giant, on Wednesday claimed his 17th victim.\nOn the other hand, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) called for strengthening surveillance actions against the possible occurrence of events related to the new coronavirus and recommended that health workers keep themselves informed about the disease, become familiar with the principles and procedures to handle infections and trained to check the travel history of patients.\nChina's Wuhan city of 11 million inhabitants and the capital of the central province of Hubei, canceled public transportation in an effort to contain the disease, according to Prensa Latina. The city closed its airports, bus and train services stopped him subways and buses.\nLocal government also called to remain in the city, and who for reasons of force majeure need to leave must apply for a special permit.

'888888,0,Li Wenliang, the ophthalmologist who is listed as the first to have detected the coronavirus and the one who alerted the authorities about the potential for contagion of the virus, died this Thursday following the infection with 2019-nCoV.\nAccording to the local press, Wenliang was one of eight people being investigated by the Chinese authorities, suspected of creating rumors and releasing a panic among the population due to the virus.\nWenliang will have detected the coronavirus and attempted to alert other doctors to the danger it posed by sending a message in a group conversation in mid-December. Days later, the British newspaper "The Guardian", was called upon by the Public Health authorities, who forced him to sign a document in which he was accused of "false statements".\nMeanwhile, the authorities have already apologized to Wenliang, adds the BBC.\nLi Wenliang was 34-year-old and on social media explained that it was the similarity between the coronavirus and the Sars- an epidemic of 2003- that caught his attention. At the time, he had detected the virus in seven people. Today, infection has reached 28 thousand people in China alone and killed more than 560.\n'
'888888,0,The San Joao University Hospital Center (CHUSJ) in Oporto has an isolation zone ready to receive possible patients infected with the new coronavirus detected in Wuhan, China. If a case is diagnosed in the North region, the main concern of the medical team is to contain the spread of the virus and for that there are already mechanisms in place.\nFirst of all, a patient possibly infected with the virus will not enter through the main door, but through a special passage from the hospital\'s infectious disease service. On the path leading from the door to the isolation room, there are several color lines that transmit different orders, more or less like a light. The green stripes mean a clean area, and that\'s the way to circulate who isn\'t infected. Yellow is a transition area (for example for doctors who have just examined a patient) and red means that we are in an infected zone. Before the end of the hall, we arrive at the division that is equipped to accommodate possible patients for as long as necessary.\nNot nearly two metres away, there is a small room where it is imperative that doctors and nurses (or any professional who comes into contact with an infected patient) equip themselves with gloves, waterproof suits, visors and masks. And there is another small division, right next to it, where after each examination the equipment is discarded, which will not be used again. On the walls are step-by-step instructions of what the professional should do (and not do), remembering that he will never be alone and that he will be supervised by another person who will make sure everything is accomplished.\nIt was in this room that the man who was sent to St John\'s Hospital last Friday because he suspected he might be infected. This was the second suspected case of infection in Portugal and ended up testing negative, like the rest of them.\nYeah.\nIn a guided tour of the PUBLIC, the Director of the Infectious Diseases Service (SDI), Antonio Sarmento, explains that there is a specific procedure for when the hospital receives a suspicious case of the virus, emphasising that each case must always be validated first by the Directorate General for Health (DGS). "The patient is transported by a team already prepared to the premises and, until proven otherwise, we will address it as an infection case according to the criteria defined by the World Health Organisation and the DGS," he says.\nAlthough there is only one room for possible cases of infection, the Director of the SDI states that if there is more suspicion, other divisions in that hospital wing will have to be activated.

"888888,0,Amid the Coronavirus outbreak that has crippled major businesses across the globe, Apple is also one of the companies that are scaling down the manufacturing processes carried out in China, which is the epicentre of the deadly virus. But, even though the production of the iPhone may be disrupted, Apple may not push back the launch schedule of the iPhone 12 series, as per a new report.\nAccording to Digitimes, citing some supply chains in China, the next-generation iPhone model, dubbed iPhone 12, may as well be launched in September without facing any postponements. Although the production of iPhone 12 models could see a snag, it will not intensify into causing a delay in the launch later this year. Apple could, however, push back the availability of select models from the iPhone 12 to meet any surging demands.\nThe report also mentions that Apple is anticipating higher demand for the iPhone 12 series units, owing to a production ramp-up for the A14 chipsets. The demand for A14 chipsets could be well more than 50 per cent than the same time last year for A13 Bionic chips because Apple is placing high hopes for its first 5G iPhone models. The A14 chipset will enable 5G connectivity on this year's iPhone models, which Apple is anticipating will churn higher revenue. Apple is said to release more new iPhone models this year, with 5G to be the mainstay among all of them.\nAccording to the Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is poised to launch four 5G iPhone models this year. There will be a 6.1-inch OLED display iPhone with two rear cameras, another 6.1-inch OLED display iPhone with three cameras and a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor, and a 5.4-inch OLED display iPhone. But much before that, Apple is highly likely to launch the iPhone SE 2 aka iPhone 9, which is also tipped to support 5G networks.\nMoreover, Apple is also said to have stopped sending key people from the iPhone engineering team to China. The engineering team is responsible for validating various hardware and software aspects of the iPhone, such as the engineering validation, design validation, and production validation. The absence of engineers will delay the process of validation, which in turn will affect the iPhone manufacturing schedule for this year.\nPreviously, Apple had to shut its stores in China in the wake of concerns centring the Coronavirus. It has also asked employees to halt travel to China and other regions hit by the epidemic. The maximum number of cases of Coronavirus has been reported in a few Asian countries.\n"

'888888,0,NEW YORK (Reuters) - An old malaria treatment that has been tried with some success against the new coronavirus and was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump at a news briefing earlier on Thursday is in short supply as demand surges amid the fast-spreading outbreak.\nThe American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), which maintains a list of drugs in shortage independent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s list, added the generic malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to its list on Thursday. Four out of eight manufacturers of the drug are currently in shortage, it said.\nThe new coronavirus, which causes the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, emerged in December in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the world.\nThere are currently no vaccines or treatments approved for the disease, but researchers are studying existing treatments and working on experimental ones.

But surging demand in recent weeks is the issue with the malaria drug, which can also treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, according to online pharmacy, Honeybee Health.\nIts co-Chief Executive Jessica Nouhavandi sent a letter to prescribers earlier this week, urging them to be aware of potential hoarding of the drug that could deprives those who really need it.\nOn Thursday, Nouhavandi said demand was its highest yet after Trump’s comments.\nJeff Bartone, who owns Hock’s Pharmacy in Vandalia, Ohio, said he purchased five bottles of hydroxychloroquine this morning, but within an hour the company that distributes it to his pharmacy had run out.\nHe said four backup prescription drug wholesalers were out of the drug as well.\nBartone said he does not typically stock large amounts of the drug because it is not widely prescribed.\nMylan NV (MYL.O) - one of the manufacturers ASHP said was in shortage - said it was ramping up production of the drug and expects to be in a position to begin supplying it more broadly in mid-April.\nIt said with the raw materials on hand it can make 50 million tablets to potentially treat more than 1.5 million patients.\nBayer AG (BAYGn.DE) said it would donate 3 million tablets of Resochin - a closely related drug known generically as chloroquine phosphate. Chloroquine is also in shortage, according to the ASHP.\nOnline pharmacy Valisure said it too was unable to order any chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine as of Thursday from its four distributors.\nValisure Chief Executive David Light said other potential treatments are also becoming difficult to obtain.\n“Kaletra and losartan are being rationed, meaning we are only allowed to order limited quantities at a time,” he said.\nKaletra, a combination HIV treatment sold by AbbVie ABBN.N, and the generic blood pressure drug losartan have been considered as potential treatments for the virus, although Chinese investigators reported this week that Kaletra failed to improve outcomes for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.\n'

We know that people with infection were taken to places of isolation or quarantine in that general area,” Klausner said.\nUC Davis said no one on its main campus has tested positive for the virus, known as COVID-19, but “out of an abundance of caution,” three campus residents are currently in isolation. One of them, who is showing symptoms of illness, has been tested for the virus, but the results are not yet in.\nThe CDC’s protocol had called for coronavirus testing in individuals with a fever or respiratory illness who have a travel history or contact that could have led to exposure to the virus.\nCalifornia officials said this protocol had to be expanded in light of the “inevitable” local spread within the United States. At least 33 people had tested positive for the virus, but five have since left the state, official said.\n“The case from yesterday is giving the CDC a lot to consider on revising those protocols so more individuals will be tested,” said Mark Ghaly director of California’s Health and Human Services Agency, referring to the woman from Solano County.\nCDC Director Robert Redfield told a U.S. congressional hearing on Thursday that more test kits were being sent to California and the agency now backs expanded testing.\n“When a clinician or a public health individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus, so that’s the current guidance that went out today,” he said.\nNewsom said the CDC has pledged to send more personnel to California to track the potential spread of the virus.\nWith new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday even rich nations should prepare.\n“No country should assume it won’t get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,” Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe’s worst outbreak.\n'

"888888,0,Health authorities in China are racing against the weather to contain the spread of a new pneumonia originating in the center of the country. World experts fear the efforts have arrived too late. Although the first cases were detected in Wuhan in mid-December, only one month later infrared temperature detection areas were installed at the city's airports and railway and road stations.\nThis Tuesday the National Health Commission updated the balance sheet for six deaths and 291 confirmed cases of this new type of coronavirus, a kind of virus that causes respiratory infections in humans and animals and is transmitted through cough, sneezing or physical contact. The day before, the National Commission confirmed that the virus is transmissible between humans, days after Wuhan's municipal health authority alerted it to this.\nThis is an exclusive article.

'888888,0,The "new coronavirus infection pneumonia spread early in Wuhan, China" provides the most detailed epidemiological data on the rapidly spreading epidemic. The authors of this paper are experts from authoritative health institutions in China, and also have considerable administrative responsibilities, including Gao Fu, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, director of China CDC, Feng Zijian, deputy director of China CDC, and Yang Bo, director of Hubei CDC.\nWhat caused much controversy is that the paper pointed out that in 2019, a new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan in mid December. "The interpersonal communication between close contacts has occurred since mid December and has gradually spread in the following month." however, the Wuhan Municipal Health Protection Commission went straight to January 11th. It also said, "no obvious human transmission phenomenon has been found." the 16 day renamed "does not exclude limited persons." The possibility of a successor, but the risk of continuous human transmission is low "; in addition, it is more controversial that the paper points out that in from January 1st to 11th and 12 to 22, there were 7 and 8 medical staff infected, but until 20, when Xi Jinping was formally addressing the epidemic, Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemic prevention expert, was informed that 15 medical staff were infected when he was interviewed. The Wuhan Health Protection Committee was delayed 21 days before it informed the 15 medical staff of the new coronavirus infection.\nWang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University, questioned on Weibo: "this is the first time that I have seen clear evidence, and the evidence of human to human transmission of the new coronavirus has been deliberately concealed!" the professor asked in an accusatory tone: "it is the scientists of the CDC who, in order to publish their papers, do not publicize the data? Is the Wuhan municipal government suppressing data disclosure for some reasons? Or what? " He further questioned: "as a researcher with first-hand information, you know the exact information about human to human transmission three weeks earlier than the public. Have you done what you should do?" His post has now been deleted.\nZhang Fengfeng, an epidemiologist at UCLA School of public health, told intellectuals that some Chinese scholars published articles in several internationally renowned magazines in a short period of time. From the data disclosed in the paper, it can be seen that many of them can be used to guide the control of this new infectious disease at the early stage of the outbreak.\nThe publication of this paper and the query of experts shocked the Internet. At the first time, these queries were almost directed at the researchers\n。 The core question that netizens question is when scientists knew when the 2019 new coronavirus would be transmitted to others. Why was it published in foreign periodicals instead of telling the truth to the domestic people earlier? Another is that scientists know that such a paper can not be published at home, so they can "save the country by curving" and "disclose the truth abroad". It seems obvious that it means to excuse scientists.\nIn the face of doubt, China CDC put forward four explanations on Friday, pointing out that the paper is based on the retrospective analysis of 425 confirmed cases reported as of January 23, and all cases have been released to the society before the paper was written. The 15 cases of infection of medical staff mentioned in the paper were also announced to the public by Zhong Nanshan and Wuhan health and Health Commission respectively from 20th to 21st; the viewpoint that human to human transmission occurred in December last year proposed in the paper "is a retrospective inference based on the epidemiological investigation data of 425 cases". Disease control experts use "retrospective" to explain that there is no problem that scientists have long known the epidemic and concealed the truth. Feng Zijian, deputy director of the center, was interviewed by the Beijing news about the infection of medical staff. One of the first doctors infected by Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital was hospitalized on January 16. Did the National Center for Disease Control and prevention not receive any information about the suspected infection of medical staff on that day? Feng Zijian said that "it is not particularly clear". The reporter asked whether the network direct report system of infectious diseases could directly reach the country within two hours Home level? Feng Zijian replied that "the use of network direct report is not so early", because Wuhan pneumonia is a new disease, and there is no infectious disease report in the directory. Adjusting the network direct report system settings requires a process of personnel training. All in all, he denied questions about the data being withheld by the CDC.\nAfter the controversy over the above-mentioned papers, there is also a view that we should not lose focus and focus on researchers. The root of the problem is power. On this point, even Zhou Xianwang, mayor of Wuhan, explained in an interview with CCTV why he didn\'t disclose the epidemic in time. He said, "as a local government, I can only disclose it after I get this information and authorize it." after that, officials in Wuhan and Hubei made similar statements, which were derided by netizens as "throwing the pot".\nSome netizens think that the scientific papers reveal two key facts: one is that there are 425 confirmed cases in January, while 198 cases were published in Wuhan on January 20; the other is that human to human transmission was confirmed at the beginning of January, which was not published until the 20th of Beijing until the local government, which obviously exposed that the Communist Party of China is lying from top to bottom\n。\nA student who claimed to be academician Gao Fu came out to defend the National Center for Disease Control and prevention. He pointed out that the center for Disease Control and prevention formally participated in the epidemic on December 31, confirmed the level II and level I response on January 6, announced the level 8, announced the level 10 sequence and diagnostic reagents, and raised the level 15 to the highest level. The response of disease control met the standard. Another netizen wrote, "is academician Gao Fu right? Not necessarily. As the director of the center for Disease Control and prevention, he didn\'t release the epidemic situation in time, and didn\'t raise the risk level of the virus in a more timely manner. All of these are Gaofu\'s pots, or at least some of them are his pots. But this is his mistake as an administrator, not as a researcher. "\nOther netizens questioned why so many things pointed to technical experts and National Centers for Disease Control and prevention all at once in order to dump the pot for the highest level. Technical experts have no right to decide on information disclosure. The key to this epidemic is not to make it public in time. It is the power of the state to suppress the truth, which is still creating chaos.\n'

"We send tests, masks, gloves, respiratory protection and coats to all regions of the world, but the world is facing a chronic lack of personal protective equipment, as you might imagine," said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nAfter the death of Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, the Chinese government launched a politically sensitive investigation. The doctor had warned early of the outbreak of the new lung disease, but shortly afterwards was warned by the police and was not allowed to spread any more about it. The State Supervisory Commission sent an investigation team to Wuhan. It\'s about the "questions of the people" about the incidents.\nThe death of the 34-year-old ophthalmologist who had died of lung disease on Thursday evening has caused great sympathy. His fate symbolises for many the consequences of the cover-up and slow reaction of the authorities.\nChina\'s head of state and party Xi Jinping sees the fight against the spread of the new Coronavirus in a "decisive phase". In a phone call with US President Donald Trump, he expressed confidence that China would get the epidemic under control. The whole country was mobilised and took strict preventive measures. "We are fully confident and able to defeat the epidemic." He criticised the US ban on Chinese and foreigners who were in China, with the exception of US citizens.\nOutside mainland China, over two dozen countries have confirmed 270 infections and two deaths.

'888888,0,Moscow, March 19. /tass/ According to TASS (TASS), one of the research and development units of Russian daily vaccines is a staff member of the Federal University of Albert Rizwan (Kazan), who comes from the region along the Volga River, It is estimated that the domestic prototype drug will not appear within six months. As scientists have pointed out, the timing of vaccine development depends on the level of scientific participation.\nScientists point out that it is very important to prove the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Scientists have been looking for drugs for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for more than 20 years, and so far, no vaccine has worked.\nOften, developing a vaccine - which is not even half, but a tenth, because the most complex - shows that the vaccine is effective and safe. In the case of coronaviruses,] the same thing is true - more groups are developing vaccines, because maybe someone will develop better ones.\n"Many countries and laboratories in the world are now committed to its establishment, and have carried out several clinical trials)（ --"I think there are many kinds of vaccines developed in the world, which may take 6-12 months.About\nKazan experts create drugs that do not use live viruses or their purified proteins. This can be achieved through genetic engineering and therapeutic tools, which are also used to treat genetic diseases and cancer.\nThe basis of this method is to introduce the gene of pathogen into human body by promoting immune response. Its advantage is that it does not need a live virus or infectious material to create a vaccine. We can take the gene release of gene decryption, and according to the genetic text of these information, with the help of genetic engineering, develop gene vaccine rapidly, As a computer program, and quickly synthesize and test animals. [if everything goes according to plan, the vaccine prototype will be ready within six months] "\nAfter the work on the vaccine prototype is completed, researchers will begin to use biological virus test drugs.\nWorld vaccine trials\nEarlier, U.S. experts said they had begun testing the first experimental vaccine for the new coronavirus.

'888888,0,LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That’s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country’s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China’s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world’s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels\n.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters’ favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China’s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed\n. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n'
'888888,0,Riyadh (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said on Tuesday he was confident that OPEC and its partner oil-producing nations, the so-called OPEC+ group, would respond responsibly to the spread of the coronavirus.\nHe also said Saudi Arabia and Russia would continue to engage regarding oil policy.\n“Everything serious requires being attended to,” the minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, told reporters at an industry conference in Riyadh.\nAn OPEC+ committee this month recommended the group\ndeepen its output cuts by an additional 600,000 barrels per day.\nSaudi Arabia supports the further oil production cut, but Russia is yet to announce its final position on the matter.\nThe minister said he was still talking with Moscow and that he was confident of Riyadh’s partnership with the rest of the OPEC+ group.\n“We did not run out of ideas, we have not closed our phones. There is always a good way of communicating through conference calls,” he said.\nRegarding the coronavirus, which has impacted OPEC member Iran, he said OPEC+ members should not be complacent about the virus but added he was confident every OPEC+ member was a responsible and responsive producer.    The flu-like SARS-CoV-2 virus which first broke out in China has now spread to more than 20 countries.    “Of course there is an impact and we are assessing, but we’ll do whatever we can in our next meeting and we’ll address that issue,” UAE energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said at the same industry conference.    Saudi Aramco [2222.SE] CEO Amin Nasser on Monday said he expected a short-lived impact on oil demand and consumption to rise in the second half of the year.”We think this is short term and I am confident that in the second half of the year there is going to be an improvement on the demand side, especially from China,” he told Reuters.\nAramco had seen minimal impact from a drop in oil demand due to coronavirus spread, he said during a panel discussion in Riyadh.\n“We expect by the second half things are back to normal. There is an impact on markets but Aramco has dealt with many crises before,” Nasser said, adding the impact on the company was “minimal”.\nThe CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) also described the impact as “temporary” at the same event.\n“Nobody can deny that there has been a temporary impact from coronavirus, we have seen that on global markets in terms of demand,” Sultan Al Jaber said.\nOil climbed on Tuesday as investors sought bargains after crude benchmarks slumped almost 4% in the previous session, although concerns about the global spread of the virus capped gains.\n'
'888888,0,The Covid-19 epidemic in China seems to be contained for once. But how does the government intend to stop the economic collapse? What about the credibility of the regime? How does the device work and why did it fail after the virus broke out? These questions and more are answered by Sebastian Heilmann, professor at the University of Trier and former director of the Berlin think tank Merics.\nONLINE TIME: China\'s government is now gradually lifting the quarantine of Wuhan and Hubei and for a week now the leadership in Beijing has declared that there are no new infections in the country. They just came in from abroad. No more Sars-CoV-2 cases in China after the official confirmation of 800.000 infections since January, can this be?\nSebastian Heilmann: It is a decision of the Politburo that the epidemic is over. Of course, the virus is not gone, but there must be no more negative messages. We have evidence that the epidemic has been contained. However, there is unofficial information that there are still cases in Southwest China that are suspected of Covid-19. The risk of a new infection wave therefore remains concrete for China. What we are seeing now is, above all, a political approach. All unpleasant information is suppressed, and the propaganda apparatus formulates the most important story in the end itself: that the epidemic has been defeated thanks to the superiority of China\'s system.\nONLINE TIME: A key reason for lifting restrictions in society and the economy is the bad economic climate. The lockdown broke China\'s economy in the first quarter. How does the Beijing leadership want to tackle the economic crisis? Europe and the USA are the main markets for China because of the virusYeah.\nHeilmann: China\'s economy, according to what we can sum up from various sources, is again at about 80 percent of its performance. But there is a real catch-up in China. The great unknown is now the demand. We have a global break-in that affects China\'s exports and supply chains and is hardly countervailable. Domestic demand is also uncertain: are people buying cars or 5G phones again to the extent expected before the crisis? Beijing will now have to save companies with its state banks, especially in the private sector, where liquidity is very tight and with minimal margins. Many small and medium-sized enterprises are on the brink.\nONLINE TIME: Will China spend as much money on this as 2009 did in the financial crisis?\nHeilmann: So far, the Chinese government has been reluctant, in flagrant contrast to the US and the major European economies, which are actually flown with support programmes. China had imposed on 2009 a huge incentive programme of 17% of gross domestic product, which also boosted demand strongly worldwide, but caused serious distortions in investment behaviour in China. Similar programmes have not yet been identified in China. Foreign projects such as the New Silk Road will also have to cope with significantly less funding in the coming years.\nONLINE TIME: Will China invest less abroad in the future?\nNot necessarily. We must expect Chinese investors to make targeted advances against companies and industries that have been closed to them so far. Crisis-related prices would be favourable for investments and acquisitions in Europe. I can imagine that many small and medium-sized businesses in Germany, to whom the economic recession is adding, are quite willing to sell. This is expected to become an increasingly important issue in the coming weeksYeah.\nTIME ONLINE: Party leader Xi Jinping now sends solidarity addresses to other countries, state and companies donate and sell medical supplies abroad, including to Europe, for example in hard-hit Italy. It may be suspected that this is not entirely unhelpful, that Beijing not only wants to improve its geopolitical position towards the Washington government, but is also seeking goodwill so that as many European states as possible, for example, choose to do so, engage latent spy suspect 5G network equipment Huawei. Is that right?\nHeilmann: Beijing is clearly about opening doors in Europe. And let us not delude ourselves: international investment is, of course, welcome in crisis-ridden European economies. China continues to invest heavily in 5G, and from there companies will come to us and say:\'We will build you the infrastructure and bring the funding right away\'; some governments will not be able to resist.\nTIME ONLINE: Can something be done about the sale of companies?\nHeilmann: The EU and national governments want to prevent a sale out in times of crisis, if necessary through state participation in companies. But I would suggest a more offensive strategy towards Beijing: "You are helping us now, selling and giving us medical aid, which we appreciate, but we want a moratorium as a confidence-building measure, that, during this crisis phase, no European companies are acquired using Chinese state banks or other state funding models."\nI think this is a viable path. The Chinese government will be open to such a proposal, because the rabid acquisition campaigns of American investors in crisis-ridden Asian economies, such as the Asia crisis between 1997 and 1999, are repeatedly criticized harshly in ChinaYeah. Chinese investors do not want to be seen as hedgehogs.\nONLINE TIME: It is a thin line between the resurgence of Covid-19 infections and the stimulation of the economy. How does China intend to strengthen domestic demand?\nHeilmann: With the aim of economic stimulus and social compensation, China\'s government is expected to introduce generous tax relief up to coupon programs so that even those on low incomes can participate in economic recovery through their consumption. I also believe that targeted purchase subsidies for cars or the badly indebted real estate sector are well possible.\nTIME ONLINE: Is there anything known about widespread dissatisfaction in the population due to the virus crisis?\nHeilmann: Dissatisfaction is regularly articulated in social media. However, as I see it, the monitoring methods have been tightened up and modernised to such an extent that no protest can be organised at the moment. In the course of the fight against the epidemic in China, we see a dramatic increase in the pooled analysis of location data, facial recognition and behavioural profiles. This epidemic has dramatically accelerated the expansion of digital surveillance in China. The control apps developed to combat the epidemic will be introduced in an adapted form in Chinese everyday life.\nONLINE TIME: What is the current status of the regime in the Chinese population?\nHeilmann: Compared to the disastrous epidemic in Italy or the USA, there are now many positive, system-supporting statements. They are generated on the one hand by propaganda, but there is also a lot of spontaneous support. A kind of live system comparison is currently taking place in front of all of us: which country is coping well with the pandemic? Chinese look to South Korea, Japan, also Italy, but especially to the USYeah. They see that the US may not have been able to cope with this epidemic and may be badly damaged economically and politically. And that, paradoxically, China\'s global status is being promoted by the pandemic, which originated from China but fought successfully there.\nTIME ONLINE: Does the KP leadership also interpret their handling of the epidemic as superiority of the authoritarian one-party system?\nHeilmann: The KP has grown up as a campaign party, it has won the revolution 1949 through mass mobilization and coercion. Since then, the KP has resorted to campaigns in every crisis situation. This kind of emergency mobilization is in the DNA of this party. The party headquarters can switch to crisis mode within a very short period of time, push aside bureaucratic rules and apparatus and drive huge waves of pressure through the entire system that no one can resist. Hard collective disciplinary measures such as the recent outbreak of the epidemic are the natural playing field for the KP.\nTIME ONLINE: There have recently been disinformation campaigns based on official Chinese authorities and partisan media: Suggestions that the virus did not come from Wuhan, that US soldiers had brought it to China or that it came from Italy. Such campaigns against other governments seldom come from Beijing. Why now?\nHeilmann: Chinese disinformation campaigns have been more frequent recently, for example in the Xinjiang question, against Taiwan or Hong Kong, most recently also against Sweden, i.e. smaller political players. But now we are seeing a global campaign aimed at changing the Corona story. China is responsible in two ways from the Western perspective. On the one hand, the initial phase was overslept and early warnings from Chinese doctors were suppressed, which made the pandemic only possibleYeah. And Beijing has allowed hundreds of thousands of Chinese to travel abroad in the last January Ridge. China therefore has a central role and responsibility as the starting point of the pandemic. But this storyline is harmful from the point of view of the Communist Party; it must be changed for the benefit of China.\nONLINE TIME: But the seriousness of the Chinese leadership, at least in Western countries, suffers with the spread of Hanover conspiracy theories.\nHeilmann: China\'s KP likes to see itself as the guardian of scientific evidence and expertise, especially in contrast to the Trump government, but also in contrast to Russian disinformation and destabilisation campaigns. I therefore think that the KP propaganda will backfire. The conspiracy theory about an American origin of the virus can be interpreted more as a test balloon of foreign policy hawks in Beijing. The party leadership is not aiming for confrontation, but for the country to be willing and helpful internationally in the Corona crisis and not irresponsible and manipulative.\nONLINE TIME: Does China\'s propaganda actually tell its people the same stories about the origin of the virus?\nHeilmann: Debt assignments to the US, which at the same time deflect responsibility from China, spread quickly in China\'s social media, because they meet the national pride of many. On the other hand, despite censorship and propaganda, most Chinese are far too clever not to recognize such simple distractions. Many are simply skeptical of official statements about the Coronavirus, because they were personally affected by this epidemic and were able to make their own observations. I expect that the story of a mysterious foreign origin of the virus will therefore not come trueYeah.\nONLINE TIME: The outbreak of the Coronavirus showed that the KP leadership was not informed about everything. The epidemic represents exactly the opposite of what the party stands for: it carries the risk of social unrest and shows that, despite the lessons learned from the Sars crisis 2003, no action was taken on the basis of scientific criteria. How could it have come to this?\nHeilmann: The KP elite in the closed party and government center Zhongnanhai in Beijing employs loyal officials and experts who receive many messages that others will never see and who filter and evaluate them for the KP leadership. These are very serious and highly trained forces, analytically sharp, strategically thinking.\nBut they are by no means risk-averse, which is typical of a highly centralised, authoritarian system such as the Chinese one. The hierarchy of officials has the greatest difficulty in passing on unpleasant or even catastrophic information, which has to be carried from bottom to top of many levels in the KP hierarchy, from the local level to the centre. This system is based on so many information filters that politically undesirable findings make it difficult to get to headquarters in time. We can see from this that freedom of information and freedom of the press is a really good thing.\nONLINE TIME: Will party leader Xi Jinping and his ruling KP rather weaken or emerge stronger from the Corona disaster?\nHeilmann: Unless there are new waves of infection in China and chaotic conditions in the USA, Xi and the KP will definitely emerge from the pandemic. If the American economy and the US dollar are seriously damaged as a result of the pandemic, then China will emerge as a winner from the system comparisoYeah. If that happens, we will then be living on another planet, with completely different political and economic forces than before the pandemic'
'888888,0,GENEVA (Reuters) - A World Health Organisation panel of experts on the new coronavirus met on Thursday to evaluate whether the outbreak, which has spread from China to several countries, constitutes an international emergency.\nThe 16 independent experts in disease control, virology, epidemiology and vaccine development were holding a second closed-door meeting at the U.N. agency’s headquarters in Geneva after not reaching a decision on Wednesday.\nDidier Houssin, an adviser to France’s national health security agency, is serving as chair. Chinese health authorities made a presentation by teleconference and have allowed a WHO team into the country who are due to report back to the panel.\nA news conference was expected later in the day.\nHere are some facts about WHO Emergency Committees:\n- Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Monday that the WHO had called an Emergency Committee to assess the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year.\n- Declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern - known as a “PHEIC” in WHO jargon - is rare.\n- The WHO panel’s recommendations, after assessing any evidence of human-to-human transmission and other factors, would  be put to Tedros, who would decide whether to declare an emergency.\n- Only five emergencies have been declared in the past decade: the H1 virus that caused an influenza pandemic (2009), West Africa’s Ebola outbreak, polio (2014), Zika virus (2016), and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019).\n- The WHO’s criteria, laid out in the 2005 International Health Regulations, define a PHEIC as “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”\n.\n- Such situations are “serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected”, carry cross-border implications and may require immediate international action, its rules say.\n- A declaration would lead to boosting public health measures, funding and resources to prevent and reduce international spread.\n- It could include recommendations on trade and travel, including airport screening of passengers, although the WHO generally aims to avoid disruptive trade restrictions.\n'

'888888,0,PARIS (BLOOMBERG) - Alibaba Group is offering Europe\'s embattled health systems a cloud-based coronavirus diagnostic tool it says it has successfully tried in China\'s hospitals. \n The move by billionaire co-founder Jack Ma\'s technology giant comes amid a bigger push by China to promote its efforts to contain the pandemic that started in the city of Wuhan and was left undiagnosed for a few weeks before spreading to the rest of the world. \n The company said it presented its machine-learning software for chest scans to healthcare representatives in France and Italy. \n Alibaba\'s efforts come as China and its top technology companies step up their outreach in Europe, showcasing virus-diagnosis and analysis tools. Telecoms giant Huawei Technologies said it offered Italian hospitals video conferencing and wireless connectivity capabilities. Internet search engine Baidu is proposing an algorithm to analyse the virus\'s biological structure. \n As Europe becomes the epicentre of the virus, Beijing\'s diplomatic and material efforts in the fight against the outbreak coincide with what\'s seen as an attempt by the Trump administration to distance itself from the region. \n "Alibaba and other private companies are enrolled by China\'s government in its long-term plan: show their ability to be an ally for Europe, and pass the message that the US is failing to help them," said Dr Antoine Bondaz, a researcher at the Strategic Research Foundation in Paris. \n France wouldn\'t refuse the help being offered, and that if Alibaba wanted to contribute to research and diagnosis it could be allowed to, a French government official said, declining to be named in line with internal policy. \n The health ministry said it hasn\'t received a proposal from Alibaba, adding that the "techniques have not been validated". The diagnostic tool is also seen as costly and time-consuming. \n Alibaba, which has been expanding its European footprint in the payments and retail sectors, claims its software, developed at its research centre called Damo, can diagnose the Covid-19 virus quickly and with 96 per cent accuracy. The company says it has tested the product in China on 5,000 patients. \n Artificial intelligence-powered scans have been increasingly used in hospitals, and companies like Alphabet Inc\'s Google have developed data-learning solutions to help doctors diagnose diseases like cancer. \n In Europe, no private company or research lab has come forward with a broad diagnosis solution so far. Atos SE, the big data and cybersecurity company, said it has offered computing capabilities to reproduce and model the 3D atomic structure of the virus to labs in Spain and France. \n In the United States, Alphabet Inc\'s healthcare unit Verily ran tests for about 20 people on its first day screening the virus on Tuesday (March 17) in California. Verily is a questionnaire-based diagnostic tool. Potential patients answer questions to determine if they need testing and are then redirected when required to Verily\'s two testing sites where another sample is taken, Bloomberg reported. \n Meanwhile, in Italy, Huawei said it donated protective suits and 200,000 masks to hospitals in Milan. Mr Thomas Miao, chief executive officer of Huawei Italy, said the company also offered equipment for wireless networks to about 10 temporary hospitals and said it\'s working with partners to create a video-conferencing platform for a real-time connection between hospitals. \n Alibaba said it shipped two million masks to the continent through Belgium last Friday. \n On Wednesday, the company published a "digital handbook" to "share their learnings from screening, to diagnosis and treatment of patients who contracted Covid-19, as well as sanitation and facility management". It also proposed a cloud-based information sharing platform for doctors. \n '

The post was later removed.\nHubei province, where authorities are rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital in six days, announced on Saturday that there were 658 patients affected by the virus in treatment, 57 of whom were critically ill.\nShanghai Disneyland was closed from Saturday.

'888888,0,Moscow, 16 November According to new research by American scientists, The main reason for the rapid spread of the new coronavirus SARS cov2 in China is the serious symptoms that have not been found for a long time; And the high infectivity of the virus itself. The results were published in the journal Science.\nAccording to the results of mathematical simulation combining the data of covid-19 cases reported in China with the data of population mobility, Before the implementation of Wuhan entry-exit restrictions on January 23, 2020, 86% of the cases nationwide were not recorded, This contributes to the rapid geographical distribution of the virus.\nAccording to the research report, these conclusions are very important to understand the transmission speed and impact of new coronavirus. It has been found that unproven infections affect more people than people think.\nConsidering that according to the data of scientists, the infection rate of asymptomatic patients is 55%, while that of non obvious diseases is 55%, In 79% of the cases, the virus carriers may not be infectedAbout\nThe results show that since the government took action to control population flow and raise awareness on January 23, 2020, the spread of the virus has accelerated significantly. Falling.\n"The outbreak of covid-19 in China was caused by mild, limited or asymptomatic symptoms and was not detected," Columbia University Press Release Jeffrey shaman, Professor of Health Sciences. -Depending on the extent and number of exposures, there may be more cases that have not been tested than people think. We found that in China, covid-19 found that these undetected infected people were multifaceted and infected. "\nIn the author\'s view, significant changes must be made in the record of patients who even suffer from symptoms of ODS. They also stressed the effectiveness of travel restrictions and publicity measures.\n"Increased awareness of the epidemic and the increased use of personal protection and travel restrictions contribute to the reduction of overall infection rates. However, it is not clear whether this decline is enough to completely stop the spread of the virusAbout -If the new coronavirus adopts the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic model, it will also spread around the world, becoming the fifth local coronavirus.\nScientists call on national authorities that have not yet widely disseminated covid-19 to take their results into account, This shows that "the secret transmission of SARS cov2 virus by vectors without obvious symptoms is the main reason for the rapid spread of SARS cov2 virus.\nThe latest information on coronal aircraft in Russia and the world can be found on the website of the government of the Russian Federation'

'888888,0,Since the Chinese city of Wuhan announced the first cases of coronavirus 31 December 2019, the figures already exceed 23,000 people infected and 490 dead worldwide, and the number of countries affected round twenties. Globally, the number of deaths is still well below other viruses such as seasonal flu. However, seeing that the transmission of the virus went beyond China\'s borders, the World Health Organization (WHO) finally declaring a global health emergency last Thursday.\nMeanwhile, scientists are trying to understand how this virus against the clock works, how to infect our cells and how it is transmitted between humans. Over the past 20 days, more than 50 reports have been published on the coronavirus, according to the journal Nature. Of these, more than half are in repositories "pre-print", ie servers that allow sharing scientific articles in open while are reviewed for publication in academic journals.\nIn an unprecedented agreement, more than 70 organizations (including large publishers such as Nature, Cell and The Lancet and institutions like the British Academy Medical Sciences or the National Institutes of Health US) have pledged to make public all his works, without waiting to be reviewed for formal publication. So, not only they are sharing all discoveries about the coronavirus with WHO, but are also available for anyone to read from anywhere in the world.\nBioRxiv is a repository that these days is publishing numerous studies on the nature of the coronavirus (20 last week), while his counterpart MedRxiv addresses aspects related to health (and has published 14 reports on this virus in the same period ).\nIn addition, scientists are putting the genetic sequences of the coronavirus available to the international community in real time. This collaborative momentum that has already been key years with the outbreak of SARS or swine flu early, it is also crucial today to assess the situation and guide policy actions. To date, the coronavirus is less lethal than SARS, for example. However, a certain mutation in their genome could dramatically increase its virulence.\nIn emergency situations is a priority to inform politicians and health quickly. The publication of an article in academic journals is a demanding process that involves months or years of work, delaying the arrival of the findings of a research group to the rest of the community. Now, the possibility of sharing before its formal publication allows reacting to epidemics in a coordinated manner and as they develop. "Quick access to information is essential to contrast everything that is happening globally," says Ester Lazarus, who investigates evolution of virus at the Center for Astrobiology. That publications are freely accessible also it allows the scientific community to evaluate the work, whether or not subscribed to the magazine turn. "These repositories eliminate access barriers while reducing delays, so they are a great way to accelerate scientific breakthrough," says Thomas Faust, scientific publishing Hindawi.\nThe Achilles heel of the "pre-print" repositories is its reliability, because the work has not previously been examined by other scientists, unlike those published in magazines. From BioRxiv and MedRxiv remember, with a note on each item, which is preliminary reports pending review. "These repositories are an extremely valuable resource, but should be used with caution and responsibility," warns Faust. "Readers should be aware that these studies have not checked with the rigor of the usual peer review in academic journals," he adds.\nThe BioRxiv himself published a study on the similarity of the coronavirus with the AIDS virus containing serious technical failures. However, scientists quickly detect these errors and the item is removed from the server and shows that the "pre-print" repositories are subject to the intense scrutiny of the scientific community. "Immediate access to what they are doing other researchers and to discuss your articles in a fluid way I think the biggest advantage [of these repositories]" argues Lazarus.'

'888888,1,TRENTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A small town in central Canada that is host to the country’s largest air force base is preparing, with some apprehension, for the arrival of some 200 evacuees from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak.\nCanada plans to fly the evacuees to the base in Trenton, Ontario, the country’s main military hub for air transport, and hold them in quarantine for two weeks. The outbreak\xa0has killed 492 people and sickened nearly 25,000 worldwide.\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday the plane was expected to arrive on Friday.\n“We understand that because of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), they are much more prepared for things like that,” said Cindy McMaster, 55, who manages the local Bargain Bin discount store. “But it’s not fair to say people aren’t worried or scared, because they are. And it is a concern in our area.”\nSARS, a contagious respiratory illness, killed 44 people in Canada in 2002-2003, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus. Government health officials say Canada is better prepared this time.\nThe evacuees arriving from China will be separated from each other and from others on the base, although family units will be kept together, the government has said. They will all stay at Yukon Lodge, a new facility on the base which resembles a small chain hotel.\nIndividuals will only be moved to a hospital if they require acute care, said the local health authority, but local hospitals were prepared, with 21 negative-pressure rooms at four of them.\n“I was in the military, I know how it works,” said resident Joyce Aucoin, 81. “There’s going to be people upset about it but once they’re here and once they’re settled and they see what’s going on, I think it will all pass.”\nLynn Cao, 60, who owns a tobacco shop in the town, had been concerned about the plane arriving until she received reassuring emails from friends on the base.\nCao said she was more anxious about her mother and sister, who live near the Chinese capital Beijing, and had sent them a large number of face masks to limit their chances of infection.\nMasks were already sold out at most of the town’s pharmacies, and at some, even before the airlift was announced.\n“It just seems like everything is so overblown,” said Frank Meiboom, president of the local rotary club. “Let’s bring these people home, bring them back to Canada and give them the best care we can and say ‘welcome home.’”\n'

Ninety-three people are in isolation wards in various hospitals, according to the latest figures.\nKey players in the field have claimed that mass cancellations of hotel bookings and tour packages have already begun across the state.\nAfter the Kerala government declared the coronavirus outbreak as a \'state calamity\', as the three positive cases were detected from Thrissur, Alapuzha and Kasaragod, tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran admitted that the sector had suffered a hit.\nThe sector had aggressively launched promotional advertisements in the domestic and international markets after the floods to revive the sector\n.\nHowever, all the efforts took a beating, with mass cancellations of hotel bookings after the outbreak of the infection in the state was reported.\nAccording to tourism department sources, during the 2019 calendar year it was projected that there would be an 18 per cent growth in the domestic and 8 per cent growth in foreign tourist arrivals.\nIn the first nine months of 2019 (January to September), domestic visitors to the southern state touched 16.48 per cent against 4.8 per cent in foreign tourist arrivals.\nThe peak season for foreign tourists is from November-February while for the domestic guests it is during April-May, August-September (Onam festival) and December-January.\nNoted travel and tourism entrepreneur E M Najeeb said tour programmes and packages are being cancelled widely from the state.\nDeclaration of the epidemic as a \'state calamity\' by the government would adversely impact the economic situation in the state, he said.\n"We completely appreciate the steps taken by the government to protect the infected persons, create awareness among the public and tackle the situation.\n“But, as far as tourism industry is concerned, such measures will scare the people. Not only tourism but all the business activities of the state will be affected," Najeeb, also senior vice president, Indian Association of Tour Operators, told PTI.\nWhile Najeeb said "over-reaction" would not augur well for the state, Jose Dominic, a key player in the hospitality industry, felt there are cancellations of hotel bookings but not as much as was being projected by the media.\nDominic said he personally felt that the state\'s reputation of having a robust healthcare system would help in such situations.\n"We cannot say that there is no cancellation of hotel bookings. There are 15-20 per cent cancellations after the reporting of the coronavirus cases. But there are bookings also," he told PTI\n.\nThough people were worried about the development, the state generally has a reputation that the safest place to be in India, especially during the time of a health calamity, is Kerala, he said.\n"We have a reputation that we will put travellers\' health first before commercial interest," Dominic, CEO of Kochi-based CGH Earth, added.\nMeanwhile, a senior official of the state tourism department said the exact number of cancellations were not yet available, but he agreed that the repeated instances of flood and other epidemics were affecting the industry.\n"As of now, the exact numbers are not available. But industry sources told us that many hotel bookings, including that of KTDC (Kerala Tourism Development Corporation) have been cancelled," he told PTI.\nThe help desks of Kerala Tourism at various centres were receiving several enquiries from people wanting to know the situation in the state, he said.\n"As of now, the situation in Kerala is under control. There is no need to worry. But still people are worried and some have cancelled their bookings," the official said.\nHowever, Praveen Muraleedharan, who runs a couple of resorts in the state, said uncertainty was looming over the industry due to the virus scare.\n"We are getting lots of cancellations. Many confirmed hotel bookings, events, conferences have got cancelled. The industry is extremely worried about the business. There is an uncertainty looming over the industry. We don\'t know from when we can start taking bookings," he said.\nMuraleedharan said the industry was also affected by the hartals or strikes even as the government had claimed that the protests will not affect the tourism sector.\n"Earlier, hartals used to affect our industry. Even now, the situation is not different. Sabarimala protests, two consecutive floods and landslides in Wayanad, Nipah, anti-CAA protests and now this coronavirus.\n“All are directly affecting the tourism industry\n. Inflow of inbound tourist and the domestic tourism movement are affected," he said.\nAccording to T K Manzoor, managing director of the Bekal Resorts Development Corporation, despite the floods and Nipha, they had recorded a remarkable increase in tourist arrivals. There is 40 per cent growth in foreign tourist arrivals in 2019 (upto September) in North Kerala districts of Kasaragod and Kannur, he said.\n"We hope to manage the present catastrophic situation due to the coronavirus. In the coming fiscal, Malabar Tourism is expected to record an uptrend though more efforts have to be put in," he said.\nKerala Tourism, which attracts international and domestic tourists, plays a significant role in the economy of the state by contributing over 10 per cent of the GSDP and providing employment to over 1.5 million people in the state.\n'

Similarly, novel coronavirus infection has been found to be more sever among men than women.\nThough studies are still on to examine the behavioural pattern of novel coronavirus inside a human body, the difference in the degree of severity of infection could be linked to a protein, scientists working on the virus have suggested.\nThis protein is called ACE-2 - which works for regulation of an enzyme involved with maintenance of blood pressure among other things - and it is found on many surface tissues including in lungs. What has emerged is that the novel coronavirus has an affinity for this ACE-2 protein and identifies this as its landing spot inside the human body.\nNovel coronavirus has many spikes on its outer surface (see the picture). These spikes are used by the virus to hook onto ACE-2 protein and enter the cell.\nOnce inside the cell, novel coronavirus multiplies fast and eats up everything before forcing the cell to burst and release next generation viruses to feed on new cells. In two to ten days, there will be enough novel coronaviruses in the body to start showing symptoms like fever, dry cough and breathlessness among others.\nThis is believed to be the normal course of novel coronavirus infection in human body. What makes it appear differently among different people is the fact that concentration of ACE-2 protein increases in humans with age. Children and young people have fewer than the elderly ones. And, women too have less number of ACE-2 proteins than men of the same age group.\nThis explains why children and young people, who usually have better immunity, have reported milder infection of novel coronavirus compared to elderly ones.\nHowever, existing medical condition could be a bigger determinant of how severe novel coronavirus infection can be in an individual irrespective of gender and age. In India, the youngest person who died after novel coronavirus infection was 38.That person had returned from Qatar and had been admitted in hospital for chronic renal failure.\n'

'888888,0,GENEVA/DUBAI - All countries need to prepare to combat the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Thursday (Feb 28), as authorities raced to contain the epidemic\'s rapid global spread and Wall Street looked set for its biggest weekly fall since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \n With new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare. \n "No country should assume it won\'t get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally," Dr Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe\'s worst outbreak. \n In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and cancelled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt spread of the flu-like disease known as COVID-19 that emerged in central China more than two months ago from an illegal wildlife market. \n The death rate appears to be around 2 percent, although it could be lower if there are many mild, undiagnosed cases, experts say. \n By comparison, seasonal influenza has a case fatality rate of around 0.1 per cent, said Anthony Fauci, Director of the US\xa0National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ahead of a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, who has been put in charge of coordinating the U.S. response. \n "So therefore you have somewhat of a serious potential for morbidity and mortality," he said, adding, "We\'re dealing with a serious virus." \n There is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time. Second positive tests have also been reported in China and could imply contracting the disease does not confer immunity. Scientists warned that much remains unknown about this new virus. \n The head of the WHO\'s emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said discussions were being held with organizers about the fate of the 2020 Olympics, scheduled for July in Tokyo, although no decision was expected soon. \n Their cancellation or relocation would be a massive blow for Japan, which said it was closing its entire school system for the next month in a bid to prevent spread of the virus. \n The virus has so far mainly battered China, causing nearly 80,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths, according to WHO figures. It has spread to another 46 countries, where around 3,700 cases and 57 deaths have been reported. \n "This virus has pandemic potential," Dr Tedros told reporters in Geneva. He said Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a "decisive point," but still short of sustained community transmission. \n MARKET SELLOFF \n Spooked by the impact on China, the heart of corporate supply chains, and the increasing effect on other countries, stocks sank deeper into the red on Thursday and oil prices fell. \n Global equity markets have dropped for six straight days, wiping out more than US$3.6 trillion (S$5.02 trillion) in value. \n The S&P 500\xa0finished 12per cent below its Feb. 19 record close, marking its fastest correction ever in just six trading days, while the Dow registered a record one-day points drop, which was also its fourth 1,000-point decline in history and the second this week. \n Dr Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, urged finance institutions to commit an initial US$10 billion funds to fighting the virus. \n "What we are really missing is tangible, high-level funding and support from global financial institutions," he said in a statement. "The possible impact of this coronavirus is far beyond a health emergency - it\'s a global crisis with potential to reach the scale of the global financial crisis of 2008." \n Traders are betting the US\xa0Federal Reserve will move aggressively to cut borrowing costs in coming months in response to the effects of the coronavirus on the economy. \n Politicians are also scrambling to respond. \n President Donald Trump\'s administration was considering invoking special powers to rapidly expand U.S. production of protective gear, two officials told Reuters. \n California\'s governor complained that the state was monitoring over 8,000 people but had only 200 test kits. \n President Emmanuel Macron attempted to rally the nation as France\'s number of reported cases doubled. \n "We have a crisis before us. An epidemic is on its way," Macron said. \n Germany, too, has warned of an impending epidemic. And Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East and beyond, announced tighter border controls. \n There is no cure for the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop. \n MISINFORMATION \'EPIDEMIC\' \n Iran extended closures of cinemas, cultural events and conferences for another week and called off Friday prayers in some cities. \n The WHO\'s Ryan said Iran\'s outbreak may be worse than realized. It has suffered the highest death toll outside China, with 26 dead, suggesting there are likely many more cases than the 245 reported, which includes some senior officials. \n Italy, desperate to stave off a probable recession, warned that an "epidemic of misleading information" could do worse harm than the virus itself. \n The coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel. \n Chinese authorities said the number of new deaths there stood at 29, its lowest daily tally since Jan. 28. There were 439 new cases in mainland China as of Thursday, the WHO said, compared to 746 elsewhere.\xa0 REUTERS \n '
'888888,0,SEOUL — South Korea summoned Japan\'s envoy on Friday (March 6) to protest against its neighbour\'s decision to quarantine South Korean visitors for two weeks, and threatened retaliation, as the bid to rein in a coronavirus ignited a new row, following a trade spat last year. \n Japan is among almost 100 nations to impose curbs on travellers from South Korea, which has suffered 42 deaths and 6,593 infections in the biggest outbreak outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. \n It has barred entry to visitors from highly affected areas in South Korea, and ordered two weeks in quarantine for others. \n "If the Japanese government does not withdraw their decision... we cannot help but devise necessary countermeasures, including reciprocal measures," Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told Japanese ambassador Koji Tomita. \n She condemned Japan\'s decision to impose the quarantine without sufficient consultation or prior notice, despite Seoul\'s efforts to persuade it against travel restrictions. \n "We express deep regret towards the unjust measures taken by the Japanese government," Ms Kang added. \n She held a separate briefing for some 100 mask-wearing diplomats stationed in Seoul later on Friday on South Korea’s prevention efforts. \n Speaking through a translator, Mr Tomita responded that Ms Kang should be well aware of the worsening situation. \n "The next two weeks are a critical time period that will determine whether or not we can put an end to Covid-19," the Japanese ambassador said, referring to the illness caused by the virus, which first emerged in China late last year. \n Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters in Tokyo that the quarantine instructions, which would also apply to visitors from China, would take the form of a request for them to stay in their hotels. \n "This is a request, we\'ll do everything to make sure people understand," he said. \n Seoul has earlier protested to the envoys of Southeast Asian neighbours Singapore and Vietnam over similar curbs. \n Tokyo faced "mistrust from the international community due to its opaque, passive" response to the coronavirus outbreak, the National Security Council (NSC) said after a meeting at the presidential Blue House earlier in the day. \n "We will explore necessary countermeasures based on principles of reciprocity," it said in a statement. \n Japan\'s chief government spokesman defended the travel restrictions. \n "The decision was the result of a comprehensive review of the information available about the situation in other countries and the effects of other measures," said Mr Yoshihide Suga. \n "I think the timing is appropriate." \n The number of coronavirus cases in Japan stood at around 1,060 as of Friday evening, with new infections reported from Yamaguchi prefecture in the southwest to Hokkaido in the north, according to national broadcaster NHK. \n The rapid spread of the disease has raised doubts about whether Tokyo will be able to host the Olympics this summer, but the government has insisted in recent days that the Games will go-ahead as scheduled. \n NUMBER OF NEW CASES FALL \n The number of new cases of the flu-like virus fell to 505 in South Korea on Friday, from 760 the previous day, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. \n Vice-Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said authorities had almost finished tests on more than 200,000 followers of a church in southeastern Daegu city at the centre of the outbreak. \n More than 90 per cent of South Korea\'s infections were in Daegu and nearby North Gyeongsang province. Smaller clusters elsewhere include a new one reported on Friday at a hospital in Seongnam, southeast of the capital. \n The number of South Korean visitors to Japan fell nearly 26 per cent last year to 5.6 million, the first drop since Japan\'s tsunami and nuclear disaster in 2011, Japanese tourism officials say. \n Difficult relations between Japan and South Korea date from the former\'s occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Last year Tokyo slapped trade curbs on South Korea, which responded with a boycott on Japanese goods and services. REUTERS \n '

'888888,0,(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* GRAPHIC: Coking coal vs spot gold: tmsnrt.rs/2QlzRMZ\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 17 (Reuters) - Amid carnage in the oil markets, and sharp losses for other commodities such as copper, you may be tempted to think gold is the best option for a positive return. But coal beats the metal.\nCoal’s image is increasingly that of a pariah fuel, demonised by environmentalists and shunned by investors wary of its role in climate change.\nBut one of the top performing commodities this year is coking coal, the higher-quality fuel used to make steel.\nCoking coal futures on the Singapore Exchange, which mirror The Steel Index price for Australian free-on-board cargoes, ended at $159.98 a tonne on Monday, up 17.7% since the end of last year.\nIn contrast, spot gold ended at $1,513.91 an ounce on Monday, down 0.2% from end-2019, with the loss extending in Asian trade on Tuesday to around 1.5%.\nAnd it’s not just coking coal. Even thermal coal, used mainly in power plants, is looking fairly solid.\nThe weekly index price for thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port, as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, was $64.87 a tonne in the week ended March 13, virtually unchanged from the $64.85 that prevailed at the end of 2019.\nLower-quality Indonesian coal with a energy value of 4,200 kilocalories per kg was at $32.77 a tonne, down 3.1% from the end of last year.\nTo put that into perspective, global benchmark Brent crude futures dropped 54.5% from the end of last year to their close of $30.05 a barrel on Monday.\nCrude has been pummelled by a supply war breaking out between top exporter Saudi Arabia and number two Russia, after the breakdown of the agreement between OPEC and its allies to curb output to bolster prices.\nOil markets have also been hit by a demand shock, with the coronavirus pandemic spreading around the world likely to knock out several million barrels per day of consumption as the skies are emptied of planes and people stay home.\nOther commodities are also suffering, with spot Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes down 35.3% from the end of last year, and London copper contracts down 14.3% over the same period.\nSo, why have both coking and thermal coal managed to stand against the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, spreading around the world since then and resulting in the lockdown of cities and countries and impinging on transportation links?\nThe coronavirus itself is part of the answer, as one of China’s main sources of coking coal, neighbouring Mongolia, closed its borders in February, cutting off up to 50% of China’s supplies.\nSeasonal wet weather in Australia’s Queensland state, the source of the bulk of exports, also crimped available cargoes and led to price increases. Australia provides more than half of the global volume of coking coal exports.\nWhile China’s economy was largely shut down for much of February as part of efforts to contain the virus, it has since re-started and coking coal demand is ramping up.\nThe Mongolian border has also reopened, but Queensland is still having weather disruptions, keeping coking coal prices resilient.\nHopes that Beijing will boost stimulus measures to bolster the economy have also supported coking coal prices, as well as those for iron ore.\nBenchmark 62% iron ore MT-IO-QIN62=ARG, as assessed by Argus, ended at $90.30 a tonne on Monday, little changed from $90.15 on the last trading day of 2019.\nThermal coal also benefited from the coronavirus as Chinese mines were either idled or working at reduced rates, boosting demand for imports of the fuel.\nWith China’s mines returning to normal, there may be an easing in demand for imported cargoes, but the imports are still competitive with domestic prices, meaning traders have a profit incentive to buy from top thermal coal exporter Indonesia and number two Australia.\nPerhaps coking and thermal coal, as well as iron ore, provide an optimistic note that commodity prices can recover once the coronavirus is contained.

"888888,0,\nI must say so far, it has been a success. That is because we started acting right from the beginning when the first three cases were identified in Kerala. Our response was very good.\nIt was not like we started our efforts groping in the dark. We did everything systematically and in a structured manner trying to find the local clusters where the infected people might have accidentally gone.\nNo, I am talking about India. The Government of India brought the stranded people from Wuhan in China, and then quarantined them.\nWe had all the information about the number of Indians in China, how many of them were coming and how many were staying back.\nIt was not like fighting an unknown enemy. We knew what we were doing. I would say it was a very structured and systematic effort that took place.\nHere in Kerala, we had only a handful of infected people. But we were confident that nobody else in India would get the infection from anybody who came back from China.\nYou should see this as the most important positive point. Not a single person in India got infected from anybody during the China epidemic.\nIt changed only when the epidemic reached Europe.\nIn the China epidemic, the numbers were limited. And we exactly knew how many people were coming to India from China. And we had fixed points of entry.\nAnother most important thing was, most of those coming from China were youngsters who were otherwise healthy.\nAlso, those who were coming from China came as single individuals as most of them were students there. They did not come as family. So, it was easy to isolate them and contain the virus. We had no difficulty in keeping them away from their families for long periods too.\nThis was what happened during the Wuhan episode.\nThe situation is totally different with the epidemic in Europe and the Middle East.\nThere are two or three reasons for this. First, people are coming from so many areas. It is a convergence of so many routes and landing in so many places in India like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kerala, Bangalore, etc.\nAnd they are getting redistributed among the Indian population.\nYes. Right now, if you look at the number, you will see that 99.9% of the infected people got infected when they were outside India.\nThis time, different strata of family members are affected because unlike those who came from China, those coming from Europe and the US are coming to join the families here. So, the first preference the moment they land at the airport, is go to their families.\nAnd most of the time they are coming to meet the elderly people in their families back home. This is a big challenge for us. Our primary job right now is to prevent them from meeting elderly family members.\nLook at the Ranni incident that happened in Kerala. The family who came here from Italy had a family reunion immediately after they landed. Then, they visited other relatives and also attended some family functions.\nI would say our country is not responsible for what has happened so far. Any control measures you announce in India will have no impact when people come to India carrying the virus. Unless of course, you stop them from coming to India.\nI will tell you how the virus spreads.\nThose coming with the virus will first infect those who are in close contact. That is not a community spread; just cluster spread. Like the family who came to Ranni infected other family members, which is the close cluster of people.\nIf another person or a group of people get infected from someone in this cluster, and then infects somebody else, we will reach a situation where we will not be able to trace the origin.\nThat's when community spread starts. Community spread happens when the cluster spread gets dispersed.\nOur job right now is to prevent the clusters from dispersing.\nIt is possible, that is what Kerala is doing right now.\nFor example, people from Ranni landed here on the 29th of February. Six people got infected from them in the first week of March. Now, we are in the third week of March. So far, not a single person who was in contact with one of these family members, has developed the disease.\nExactly.\nFrom what the prime minister said, it appears that other states are following the same method as this is the only scientific method to prevent community spread.\nWhat we have done is nothing out of the world; just a scientific and systematic approach to the problem.\nNow, the 150-odd people who have come to the country with the virus, are staying in their own homes. If they infect their family members or the infected family members go out and infect somebody else, we may find it difficult to trace them.\nThat's why we are trying to track the route of the maximum number of people and keep them in the net so that we will come to know immediately when somebody develops the symptoms.\nThe only way to prevent the disease from spending is keeping the infected person away from the population. And that's what we are doing right now.\nNo. We do not have enough scientific information on whether environmental temperature has anything to do with this.\nWe see the Gulf countries also getting affected, and we can't say that the temperature is low in those countries. Their winter is over, and now the temperature is high.\nYou can't say that India is not getting affected; India is getting affected. And the time is only catching up with us, and we do not know whether the numbers will go up or not.\nThe difference is, other countries did not behave the way we have done so far.\nIn fact, even though we are telling people not to panic, we are sending panic messages, and this should keep the Indian population away from the infected people. In a way, this shouting out is good.\nToday, except in the metropolitan cities, you don't see anyone outside on the streets. If you go to any place in Kerala right now, you will see that people are not coming out at all.\nFor a disease to affect people, you need three components. One is, the person should have the virus. Second is the transmissible range of the virus. And the third is the number of susceptible people who are coming into contact with the person with the virus.\nThis is the formula; AxBxC. Here A is constant; the number of people who are infected is constant right now. It is increasing only at a slow pace.\nThe transmissible range is fixed as far as the virus is concerned. It is not going to change and it is not changing.\nSo, the determinant of the formula AxBxC is the number of susceptible people who are going to get into contact with the person with the virus. That is where we are right now.\nWhat has happened in many other countries is, for example in Europe or the US, the control of the government on the common man is much, much less than what we have here.\nHere, the common man listens. We have a tendency to listen to or respect authority. We don't question them. This may be one of the good traits that Indians have.\nThis is exactly what helped China though whether you want to listen to authority or not, you are forced to listen there. And the authority was very powerful too. Here the authority is not powerful, but people are ready to listen.\nThere is no doubt about it. We now know how to face the disease.\nIf it had happened here in India first instead of in China, it would have been the end of it!\nYes, we have been fortunate that way.\nBut looking at what is happening in the European countries, the US and the UK, I feel they have not learnt the lessons from the China epidemic.\nAlso, Europe has a porous border. So, it is easy for the virus to spread.\nIf you take India, there are hundreds of villages in India where people don't need to mix with outsiders. While mixing happens very easily in Europe. That could be one of the reasons why it spread so fast throughout Europe.\nThough there is no scientific proof to it, I think because Indians are exposed to so many viruses, we do not know whether immunity against one of those viruses is protecting us from the coronavirus. We do not know. It is a remote responsibility.\nIf the virus can kill somebody, it can survive only for a short time.\nIf the virus does not kill you, it can survive for a longer period.\nAbout SARS, anybody who is infected with SARS lives only for a very small span of time. That was what happened with Nipah, and Ebola where the mortality rate was very high.\nAnd when the mortality rate is so high, the number of people remaining with the virus comes down.\nSimilarly, nobody with HIV virus dies immediately; they live for 10 to 15 years.\nIt means, in such conditions, viruses survive in the human body for longer periods. When that happens, more and more people get infected from them.\nThe problem with coronavirus is that only the elderly is affected. So, if we have a system where the elderly alone is protected, we can prevent deaths and infections a lot.\nThat's why in the guidelines to be followed, the government has asked people above 65 to be quarantined even if they are not infected. This will prevent the vulnerable population from getting exposed to the virus.\nIf nobody dies of the coronavirus, nobody will be bothered about the virus. See, we have the common cold, flu, respiratory viruses and hundreds and thousands of people get infected. But nobody dies of these viruses.\nOur problem is the elderly and people with existing illnesses. So, our target should be to see that these people do not get infected.\nIn the case of HIV, we had a similar situation till ART became available. With HIV treatment available, things are totally different.\nIn the case of covid-19, a majority of people who are suffering from the infection are recovering without any problem.\nWe are not worried about the number of youngsters getting infected with coronavirus because they will have a spontaneous recovery. Their mortality is 1 in 1,000 which is much less than, say, road accidents. More young people die from road accidents than due to coronavirus infection.\nWe are only worried about the young people giving the infection to those around them, and they include the elderly and the diabetics. So, we want to prevent that from happening./p>\nBy now, we know what is going to happen tomorrow. The whole picture is clear to us. That is why India is likely to succeed in this war.\nYes. Unlike European countries, a majority of our population is young. Maybe that's why India has a bigger chance to succeed against covid-19. We cannot say anything with certainly unless we prove it scientifically.\nIndia may not succumb like other countries. At the same time, if we are a little careless, we will run into trouble. No doubt about that.\nYes. If you are not worried, you will not be careful. Like any country in the world has to be worried, India also has to be worried. If you are careless, there will be problems.\nYes, the next two weeks are crucial. Because if we go to the next stage, then it will be a stage of no return. That is what happened to Italy and the whole of Europe.\nWe don't want to go to that stage. Controlling 150 people who came to India is not difficult, but controlling even 50,000 people is very difficult and impossible.\nThat will happen with all epidemics. After some time, the number of susceptible population will come down, that is when a good number of them either die or recover.\nThere is nothing unusual in China not reporting any new cases. It is something we have expected. The earlier you reach that, the more comfortable you are.\nIt is difficult to say. Every epidemic has got a trajectory; it goes up to a significant level and then comes down.\nThe only corollary I can think of is H1N1. It is still there in the community, but the big panic about it is over now.\nWhen people get H1N1, they are not dying in large numbers. Because we know how to handle the situation.\nSo, I feel covid-19 might linger on for many more months at a smaller pace. Or, it can become catastrophic. It is practically unpredictable now.\nWe are worried whether we will go to that situation. It is a real worry for the entire world.\n"

'888888,0,BEIJING/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China is withdrawing the press credentials of American journalists at three U.S. newspapers, intensifying a bitter fight between the world’s top two economies that has widened to include the coronavirus outbreak and media freedoms.\nBeijing announced on Wednesday what it said was retaliation against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists that includes revoking the accreditations of American correspondents with the New York Times (NYT.N), News Corp’s (NWSA.O) Wall Street Journal and Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.\nThe move is a sharp escalation of a dispute that saw Washington last month force Chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies.\nBeijing then expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the “real sick man of Asia.”\nWashington then slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the United States at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. It cited a “deepening crackdown” on independent reporting inside China.\nBeijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. It said they must hand back their press cards within 10 days.\nThe expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which said it “deplores” China’s decision.\nChina’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on how many journalists are affected.\nBeijing also said the China branches of the three papers plus the Voice of America broadcaster and Time magazine must “declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.”\nThe latest development follows a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness COVID-19.\nThe virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people globally, bringing normal life in many parts of the world to a standstill.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Beijing’s move on Wednesday would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in “incredibly challenging” times brought about by the coronavirus.\n“I regret China’s decision today to further foreclose the world’s ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people,” he said. “This is unfortunate... I hope they’ll reconsider.”\nMedia executives denounced the move.\n“We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U.S. reporters,” Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said in a statement. “The Chinese government’s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to COVID-19 is essential.”\nDean Baquet, executive editor at The New York Times, also condemned the decision.\n“It is a grave mistake for China to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world’s top news organizations,” he said.\nMatt Murray, editor in chief at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, said: “We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world. Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.”\nTime Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal said: “We oppose any effort by the Chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world.”\nA representative of Voice of America was not immediately reachable.\nA striking aspect of Beijing’s move was its decision to bar the journalists from working in Hong Kong and Macau, two semi-autonomous territories of China with their own media accreditation rules. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.\nThat raised questions about Hong Kong’s autonomy under the “one country, two systems” agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland.\n“There’s no precedent for China dictating who can and can’t report from Hong Kong openly,” said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Asia program coordinator. “It very seriously erodes Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedom of the press.”\nThe Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in Hong Kong.\nIt said Hong Kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in Hong Kong and those applying to work in the city will continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the Chinese government.\nBeijing said on Wednesday that its actions “are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States.”\nPompeo said he did not think Beijing’s latest move was a balanced response. “This isn’t apples to apples,” he said, charging that the Chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of “propaganda outlets.”\nChina has repeatedly denounced the Wall Street Journal’s “sick man” column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologize, revoked the visas of the three reporters in Beijing. Another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after China declined to renew his visa.\n'

'888888,0,HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday increased a relief fund to tackle the impact of the coronavirus outbreak as she urged residents to accept the government’s quarantine plans for returning passengers from a cruise ship stranded in Japan.\nLam said the government would increase handouts to tackle the outbreak to HK$28 billion ($3.60 billion) from HK$25 billion pledged previously, to ease the impact on the Chinese-ruled city’s battered economy.\nLam last week announced one-off payments to businesses across the Asian financial hub and the Hospital Authority.\nThe coronavirus has killed more than 1,800 people across the border in mainland China and one of 60 patients in Hong Kong.\nAnger has been brewing over Lam’s handling of the crisis, with critics calling on her to shut the entire border with mainland China and some medical workers going on strike.\nLam has said a full closure of the border would be impractical, inappropriate and discriminatory.\nThe virus has opened up a new front for protesters, coming after months of demonstrations over the perceived erosion of Hong Kong freedoms by Beijing, which China has denied.\nHundreds of anti-government protesters marched in multiple neighborhoods over the weekend against plans to turn some buildings into coronavirus centers.\nMore than 300 Hong Kong passengers on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess will be sent to a newly built public housing estate for quarantine when they arrive in the city from Japan on Thursday, Lam told a media conference.\n“We currently don’t have any back up plan, our construction works for other quarantine centers need time, and we have a few projects ongoing,” Lam said in response to a question on public anger at the decision to house the cruise passengers in an area in the city’s New Territories.\nThe government is sending aircraft to bring back the passengers to Hong Kong where they will have to do a further 14 days of quarantine.

'888888,0,PARIS — The sharp rise in cases and the geographical spread of the coronavirus outside China confirm World Health Organization (WHO) fears over dealing with the crisis, experts warned Sunday (Feb 23) as they appealed for ever greater vigilance. \n "There has been a profound shift in the direction that Covid-19 is taking over the past 48 hours," said Professor Devi Sridhar, Director of the Global Health Governance Programme at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. \n "The WHO and its member state governments now need to be thinking about transitioning from containment to mitigation, ie. reducing the negative impacts of continued transmission," Ms Sridhar warned.\xa0 \n On Friday, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had already sounded the alarm, saying the window to stem the virus was shrinking. \n "We are still in a phase where containment is possible... our window of opportunity is narrowing," he warned, adding if countries did not quickly mobilise to counter the virus spread, matters could get "messy." \n He also warned that Africa\'s poor health infrastructure left it vulnerable to the Covid-19 disease, which has spilled out of China to more than 25 countries. \n Those fears have been compounded by three fatalities in recent days in Italy\xa0— where some 50,000 people are in lockdown\xa0— eight in Iran and six in South Korea. \n The WHO has expressed concern at the apparent emergence of cases without a clear epidemiological link to China, where it emerged. \n \'ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\' \n "It\'s what we call the passage to community transmission," said Professor Arnaud Fontanet, specialist in epidemiology of emerging diseases at France\'s Pasteur Institute. \n "That renders controlling it much more difficult and presages the risk of its introduction beyond China." \n Cases in both Lebanon and Canada appear to have emanated from Iran, for example, while, in Italy, scientists are puzzled that they cannot trace a link between several cases of sufferers with no apparent links to infected persons.\xa0 \n "What is happening in Italy and South Korea and Iran could happen anywhere in the world," said Ms Sridhar.\xa0 \n Ms Nathalie MacDermott, lecturer at King\'s College London, said "the evolving situation in South Korea, Iran and Italy is very concerning. \n "There has been the expectation that some countries might develop person to person transmission of Sars-CoV2 following an imported case of infection from an affected country. \n "What is concerning is the lack of clear contact with such an individual in initiating clusters in these three countries, and particularly in Iran and Italy." \n Ms MacDermott urged all countries to take prompt action "to try and contain these clusters before there is dissemination to large proportions of the population." \n "I think this is a new phase" in the propagation of the virus as new chains of transmission emerge from previously undetected cases, says Mr Eric D\'Ortenzio,\xa0epidemiologist at France\'s Inserm medical research institute. \n He likewise urged increased surveillance for any potential emergence of home-grown cases as well as areas known to be already affected by the outbreak.

'888888,0,Scientists in China studying the origin of the new coronavirus viral epidemic say they\'ve discovered two major strains of the virus that may be causing infections. Researchers, from the Faculty of Life Sciences of the University of Beijing and the Shanghai Pasteur Institute, under the auspices of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, warn, however, that the study has examined a still limited amount of data and that more data is needed to better understand the evolution of the virus.\nThe preliminary study found that a more aggressive strain of the new coronavirus, associated with the outbreak in Wuhan city (Hubei province), corresponds to 70% of the samples analysed, while 30% was linked to a less aggressive strain. The prevalence of the most aggressive virus decreased in mid-January, they also reported.\n"These results strongly support the urgent need for more comprehensive studies combining genetic data, epidemiological data and clinical records of patients\'symptoms with Covid-19", wrote the team in an article published last Tuesday in the National Science Review of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe results are disseminated in full decline in new cases of the coronavirus, after the application of huge restrictions by China, to halt the spread of the virus in the world\'s second largest economic market, including the suspension of transport and the extension of the Lunar New Year\'s holiday.\nContinental China had 119 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Tuesday, according to the National Health Commission, a slight decrease in the new 125 on Monday, a downward trend that has been occurring since mid-February.

'888888,0,According to Apple Daily reported on the 29th, Wuhan pneumonia, the central storage of materials for the PLA Chemical Corps deployment?\nAccording to the report, the new epidemic of pneumonia in Wuhan, China is grim. The CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered at least 4 speeches in a week, which instructed the PLA to give full support to local prevention and control. Some sources pointed out to apple that after the closure of Wuhan City, all traffic stops, doctors go to and from work, and materials are delivered by volunteer teams initiated by the people\'s government. However, they received a message on Tuesday night asking the teams to withdraw. They cooperated with the central government to monopolize the power of distributing civilian medical materials, the PLA\'s medical teams drawing sea, land and air from the 24th to enter the city, as well as President Xi\'s latest instructions, It is expected that Wuhan will face great changes this morning.\nAccording to the previous report, among the nearly 6000 elite doctors and nurses from all provinces, there are many veterans who have fought against SARS. Most of the rescue teams are set up by the local health committee. The increased medical care came from Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Shanxi, Jilin, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Hebei, Fujian, Yunnan, Jiangxi, three military medical universities and the National Health Commission, the State Administration of traditional Chinese medicine, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangdong Administration of traditional Chinese medicine, Beijing Administration of traditional Chinese medicine There are 18 provincial medical teams, 3 military hospital medical teams and 4 TCM medical teams.\nIn terms of materials, 32 tons of drugs and masks arrived in Wuhan by special plane of SF express as early as the 24th, the report said. The Ministry of Finance approved an emergency allocation of 1 billion yuan of epidemic prevention and control subsidy in Hubei Province according to the deployment of the State Council on the 23rd. On July 27, the Ministry of Finance allocated another 500 million yuan to Hubei Province.\nThe report refers to Hankou hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Western Hospital of universal love hospital, seventh hospital of Wuhan, Ninth Hospital of Wuhan, Wuchang Hospital of Wuhan and five hospitals of Wuhan. All the outpatient departments are designated by the municipal government as the centralized reception hospital for fever outpatient. According to the official confirmed cases in Hubei Province, 444 cases were reported on the 22nd, 549 cases on the 24th, 1052 cases on the 26th, and 2714 cases on the 28th. With more than 3 tons of materials, the increased medical care plus the medical care in Wuhan itself, as well as the medical supplies, should be sufficient. Yes, all the front-line doctors and nurses of the above hospitals sent out a call for help to the people last week, that is, after the arrival of a large number of manpower and materials, reflecting that the front-line doctors and nurses did not get reinforcements in the first time\n。\nIn addition, a large number of non-governmental materials have been intercepted and suspected of being confiscated, and the announcement of the Ministry of Civil Affairs has also revealed a mystery, the Apple Daily said. Sources pointed out that some logistics companies deceived them to include a batch of materials collected from the private sector into their warehouses on the basis of providing free storage; other private volunteers bought medical materials from overseas spontaneously, but also were intercepted by the customs, saying that the state would levy them, send them to Wuhan if they wanted to donate, and return them without donation. The Civil Affairs Bureau also issued a notice on the 26th that the central government should monopolize the right of distribution of materials, forbid charitable organizations and voluntary service organizations from other places to enter Hubei Province, organize volunteers, and assign designated organizations to collect and follow the pneumonia prevention and control headquarters in Hubei Province, Wuhan city and other places.\nThe Apple Daily said that President Xi made many speeches and spoke frankly about "listening to the party\'s command". Yesterday, he asked the PLA to give full support to local authorities in the prevention and control of the epidemic. It is expected that Wuhan will usher in great changes this morning. The elite medical staff who have been reinforced may be temporarily recruited to enter Wuhan hospital as the chemical defense regiment of the people\'s Liberation Army. The materials and personnel that have been hoarded earlier may be reserved for military use.\n'
"888888,0,\nSome top doctors have said that Indians are strong and imply that we will tide over this, but the right message needs to go out that this is a serious crisis and we have to get our act together.\nDoctors need to be ready for very hard times ahead. Colleagues in US and Italy say they are dealing with a war-like scenario. Italy has reached a point where doctors have to make a choice about which patients have a chance of surviving and which will we let die.\nMy worry is that we are going to get to that point soon because we don't have enough resources.\nWe also have to understand that a lot of doctors in India are old and have diseases themselves. Our buffer stock of protective equipment is very limited, we will be out of stock soon.\nKeeping that in mind, should we expose our elderly doctors with prevailing illnesses? Or should we tell them to keep away and bring young doctors who have very little experience? All these are very hard decisions.\nThe conservative estimate is that between 20% to 60% of all adults are going to be infected -- so if we use up our stock right now, then we will reach a stage when we will not have any masks left for later.\nIf healthcare workers start getting sick when the pandemic is peaking, it will be a huge crisis.\nWe need to take very thoughtful and strategic decisions.\nIf you have come from a country with a high number of cases, then people must self-isolate for 14 days. There is a guideline by the government about how to do that and not infect others staying with you.\nBut that is not enough, we have passed the point when we can contain it from the outside. Containment from the outside is not going to save people from getting infected. It is about flattening the curve.\nLet me explain the concept of R0, which means how many people at an average will an infected person infect. On an average, for Covid, each infected person infects 2 to 3 people -- it means that it is going to propagate exponentially.\nYou can't stop that growth, you can slow it until a sizeable chunk of the population becomes immune.\nHerd immunity is a concept based in vaccination. When a certain number of people have developed immunity to the infection it then disrupts transmission.\nWhat the UK is betting on is that let young people get infected now because then they will have immunity and will disrupt transmission later.\nThey feel they can manage the old people who get sick, but if they let everyone get sick later it will disrupt their healthcare system.\nBut this is a gamble. There is no evidence to show that this is going to happen. Experts have strongly condemned this strategy and in fact UK has thankfully backtracked.\nWe know what has worked in China, South Korea, Japan -- the reason the UK is mulling this option is because no free people will accept the conditions imposed in China. Countries have gone to war for far less freedom.\nThe UK, the USA, Europe and India won't accept that kind of strict conditions. Tomorrow, if the government says everyone stay at home, many will starve.\nThere has to be a universal basic income programme to compensate for the loss of wages, but more importantly there is so much distrust in the government in some communities.\n\nNo one can predict the weather and the response to the weather. It is a new virus, so we don't know whether it may happen or not.\nThe influenza virus cases in temperate climes like the US and Kashmir spike in winter and reduce in summer. The human body temperature is just below 37 degree centigrade, in a fever it can go up to 40 and sometimes above 40.\nIn winter, the contact process changes because people cluster indoors while in the summer people are outdoors.\nWhile in tropical areas like Mumbai, influenza spikes in the monsoon.\nIn case it behaves like an influenza virus, then the cases should decrease. This study applies to seasonal viruses where there is a herd immunity, but when there is a pandemic strain, no one has immunity so the risk of infection is high.\nDengue, influenza, malaria cases spike during the monsoon in Mumbai. There are not enough ICU beds and people die without ICU care of those diseases right now, so what are we going to do even if Covid-19 drops by then?\nThere may be a drop in the rate of new infections. The graph may slow down, but it is still going upwards.\nInstead of 100 new infections per day you may have 50 infections a day, but the total number is still increasing while the ICU beds remain the same -- so every new case in that scenario is a new patient you will find hard to treat.\nIndividually, wash you hands with soap and water frequently for 20 to 40 seconds.\nThink of the virus as a little bit of fat surrounding a core. Like if you have butter or ghee on your hands and it dissolves when you wash your hand with soap and water.\nSoap destroys the fat layer of the virus and it gets destroyed. If you are going to touch your face, at least wash your hands first.\nSecond, avoid touching your face.\nYou must cough into a tissue and throw it away in a closed bin. The other practical way is to cough into the fold of your elbow because the inside of your elbow is not going to touch anything.\nTry and be one metre away from everyone if possible. If someone is sick, then at least two metres away.\nCollectively, I would like to formulate a plan which has a network of medical workers connect with patients through telemedicine and guide them.\nEach one will be assigned to a community area and guide them like say, in a chawl or a slum.\nA building society will make action committees, the action committee will segregate the society into green and red zones with a buffer zone in between.\nInfected people will go in red zones where people will have to share houses, you can't provide separate rooms in India because many homes don't have more than a room and a bathroom.\nThe buffer zone will be a team of action members who need to be young, technology savvy, disease free and non smokers. They have to be segregated into red and green zone workers, red zone workers will work with only sick people.\nIn the green zone we will need to put all the most vulnerable people -- elderly, diabetic, heart and lung disease patients. India is a world leader in diabetes and heart disease.\nYou have to think of radical social reorganisation strategies.\nThe underplayed projection is 1.5 million ICU admissions over the next 12 to 18 months, while we have only about 100,000 ICU beds.\nThere is no way we can scale that up so quickly and even if we do, we don't have enough doctors and nurses and equipment.\nIn India even for the diseases besides Covid-19, we have a shortage. Even if Covid-19 decreases by 90%, the remaining 10% will fill up all the beds and people will start dying of dengue, malaria, typhoid and monsoon related diseases.\nA collapse of societal infrastructure becomes the breeding ground for other diseases.\nHealthcare workers treating coronavirus have been among the hardest hit. It is scary, but this is what we signed up for and became doctors.\nEven doctors get scared and nurses cry.\n"

'888888,0,Health officials in Washington state said Sunday night that a second person had died from the coronavirus a man in his 70s from a nursing facility near Seattle where dozens of people were sick and had been tested for the virus.\nResearchers said earlier the virus may have been circulating for weeks undetected in Washington state.\nIn a statement, Public HealthSeattle & King County said the man died Saturday. On Friday, health officials said a man in his 50s died of coronavirus. Both had underlying health conditions, and both were being treated at a hospital in Kirkland, Washington, east of Seattle.\nWashington state now has 12 confirmed cases.\nState and local authorities stepped up testing for the illness as the number of new cases grew nationwide, with new infections announced in California, Illinois, Rhode Island, New York and Washington state.\nAuthorities in the Seattle area reported four new cases Sunday night, including the man who died. Two health care workers in California were also diagnosed. Of the new Washington state cases, two were women, one in her 80s and another in her 90s. Both were in critical condition. A man in his 70s was also in critical condition. All three were from the LifeCare nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, where health officials said 50 people are sick and being tested for the virus.\nOn Sunday night, the International Association of Fire Fighters said 25 members who responded to calls for help at the nursing facility are being quarantined.\nThe first U.S. case was a Washington state man who had visited China, where the virus first emerged, but several recent cases in the U.S. have had no known connection to travelers.\nIn California, two health care workers in the San Francisco Bay area who cared for an earlier coronavirus patient were diagnosed with the virus on Sunday, the Alameda and Solano counties said in a joint statement.\nThe health care workers are both employed at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville, California, and had exposure to a patient treated there before being transferred to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, the statement said. That patient was the first person in the U.S. discovered to have contracted the coronavirus with no known overseas travel.\nAlameda County declared a state of emergency on Sunday following the news.\nIn Oregon, the state Health Authority said Sunday that a second person in the state tested positive for the virus. The person is an adult in household contact with the first Oregonian to test positive and does not need medical attention, the authority said.\nElsewhere, authorities announced Sunday a third case in Illinois and Rhode Island and New York\'s first cases as worried Americans swarmed stores to stock up on basic goods such as bottled water, canned foods and toilet paper.\nThe hospitalized patient in Rhode Island is a man in his 40s who had traveled to Italy in February. New York confirmed Sunday that a woman in her late 30s contracted the virus while traveling in Iran. The patient is not in serious condition. She has respiratory symptoms and has been in a controlled situation since arriving in New York, according to a statement from the governor\'s office.\nAs the fallout continued, Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar sought to reassure the American public that the federal government is working to make sure state and local authorities are able to test for the virus. Both said during a round of TV talk show appearances Sunday that thousands more testing kits had been distributed to state and local officials, with thousands more to come.\n"They should know we have the best public health system in the world looking out for them," Azar said, adding that additional cases will be reported and the overall risk to Americans is low.\nAs the cases ticked up, some Americans stocked up on basic supplies particularly in areas with diagnosed cases and began to take note of the impact on daily life. Stores such as Costco sold out of toilet paper, bottled water and hand sanitizer outside Portland, Oregon, where a case was announced Friday. Sports games and practices were canceled into the coming school week. Some churches said they would not offer communion because of fears of viral spread.\nAs Americans prepared, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington on Sunday said they had evidence the virus may have been circulating in the state for up to six weeks undetected a finding that, if true, could mean hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the area. They posted their research online, but it was not published in a scientific journal or reviewed by other scientists.\nTrevor Bedford, an associate professor who announced the preliminary findings on the virus in Washington state, said on Twitter late Saturday that genetic similarities between the state\'s first case on Jan. 20 and a case announced Friday indicated the newer case may have descended from the earlier one. The Jan. 20 case was the first known case in the U.S.\n"I believe we\'re facing an already substantial outbreak in Washington State that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to China," he said on Twitter.\nBedford did not immediately reply to an e-mail requesting an interview Sunday.\nScientists not affiliated with the research said the results did not necessarily surprise them and pointed out that for many people especially younger, healthier ones the symptoms are not much worse than a flu or bad cold.\n"We think that this has a pretty high rate of mild symptoms and can be asymptomatic. The symptoms are pretty non-specific and testing criteria has been pretty strict, so those combinations of factors means that it easily could have been circulating for a bit without us knowing," said Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nDr. Adam Lauring of University of Michigan called the findings "high quality work" from scientists who\'ve done similar work with the flu virus for years.\n"They show their data and they show their work," Lauring said. "It\'s more than a series of tweets" because the researchers back up what they found with data that they\'ve shared online. "If there\'s something wrong, someone will find it."\nDr. Carlos del Rio of Emory University School of Medicine said the findings are from respected researchers in genomic sequencing and they make sense because of the geographic proximity of the two cases.\n"This is a good time to reinforce the things we all should be doing to stop the spread of flu. Wash your hands. Don\'t touch your face. If you have a cold, stay home ... It\'s a good time to remind ourselves of that," he said.\nPence, named by the president to be the point-person overseeing the government\'s response, said more than 15,000 virus testing kits had been released over the weekend. And, the administration is working with a commercial provider to distribute 50,000 more, he said.\nThe vice president said testing was among the first issues raised by governors he\'s spoken with so far. Several states have begun their own testing, including Washington state, Oregon and Illinois.\n"We\'re leaning into it," Pence said.\nAzar said more than 3,600 people already have been tested for coronavirus and the capability exists to test 75,000 people. He forecast a "radical expansion of that" in the coming weeks.\nPence and Azar spoke a day after President Donald Trump approved new restrictions on international travel to prevent the spread within the U.S. of the new virus, which originated in China. There are now more than 80,000 cases worldwide and about 3,000 deaths.\nThe number of known coronavirus cases in the U.S. had reached at least 80 as of Sunday, counting people evacuated from a cruise ship and the city of Wuhan in China.\nTrump said Saturday at a White House news conference that he was thinking about closing the southern border with Mexico as a precaution. Azar said Sunday that Mexico has few coronavirus cases and that it would take a dramatic change in the circumstances there to prompt serious consideration of a border shutdown.\nThe president, Azar said, "was trying to say everything\'s on the table."\n"We will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the American people, but we don\'t forecast doing that any time soon," he said of closing the border.\nDespite calls by Trump and Pence for political unity in the face of the viral threat, the issue has become mired in the partisan rancor in Washington, with both Republicans and Democrats accusing each other of mining the issue for political gain.\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the hospitalized patient in Rhode Island is a man, not a woman, who traveled to Italy in February.\n'
'888888,0,With the global outbreak of the coronavirus, many unusual wedding stories are also coming forward. While some of them have been inspirational, some have been unusual to say the least.\nFor instance, remember the doctor in China, who had a quick 10-minute wedding so that he could rush back to the hospital and treat the coronavirus patients?\nWell another couple’s wedding story is also going viral but for a very unusual reason because the celebration for their wedding went ahead without the bride and groom.\nA Singapore couple Joseph Yew and Kang Ting had gone for a trip to China to spend the Lunar New Year there. They had visited the Hunan province, which borders the Hubei province of which Wuhan is the capital. And right now, Wuhan is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\nSo when guests expressed their concern over attending the couple’s wedding, they came with an unusual plan. Instead of attending the celebrations at the venue, the couple, dressed in their wedding ensembles, live streamed from their hotel room with their friends and family, who enjoyed the occasion in the wedding hall.\nIn fact, the couple even made their toasts and their speeches on the video call.\n"Some of them said they were not coming. We wanted to postpone the wedding but the hotel was not willing to. They said everything had been arranged and it was non-negotiable. So we felt like we had no choice but to proceed with the wedding," Yew told BBC.\nThough the guests were shocked in the beginning but they were relieved too, "I think if we had been there, the atmosphere would be different. People would have been wary," he added.\nThe couple actually got married in China in October, and had planned a grand dinner banquet in Singapore for their family and friends who were unable to make it to China.\n'
'888888,0,WASHINGTON/TOKY0 - As the new coronavirus spreads in South Korea, Europe and the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move to try to prevent a global recession with the virus taking a heavy toll on air travel, tourism and other industries.  \n Despite the Fed\'s attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, U.S. stock indexes were down more than 3%, safe-haven gold rose 3% and analysts and investors are questioning if the rate cut will be enough in the long run if the virus continues to spread.  \n In Iran, doctors and nurses lack supplies and 77 people have died, the highest number outside China. The United Arab Emirates announced it was closing all schools for four weeks.  \n The death toll in Italy, Europe\'s worst-affected country, jumped to 79 on Tuesday and Italian officials are considering expanding the area under quarantine. France reported its fourth coronavirus death and Iceland, Indonesia, Ukraine and Argentina reported their first coronavirus cases, taking the global total to around 80 countries.  \n About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu\'s fatality rate of under 1%, but the novel coronavirus can be contained, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.  \n "To summarise, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained," World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.  \n Health officials have said the death rate may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease.  \n The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.  \n There are almost 91,000 cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China.  \n China\'s death toll was 2,943, with more than 125 fatalities elsewhere.  \n In a unanimous decision, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. U.S. President Donald Trump said a half point cut was not enough.  \n Finance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth.  \n  \n AGGRESSIVE CONTAINMENT  \n China - where new coronavirus cases have been falling sharply and the 129 cases in the last 24 hours was the lowest number reported since Jan. 20 - is increasingly concerned about the virus being brought back into the country by citizens returning from new hotspots elsewhere.  \n Travellers entering Beijing from South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy would have to be quarantined for 14 days, a city official said. Shanghai has introduced a similar order.  \n The worst outbreak outside China is in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in declared war on the virus, ordering additional hospital beds and more masks as cases rose by 600 to nearly 5,000, with 34 deaths.  \n WHO officials also expressed concerns about the situation in Iran, saying doctors lacked respirators and ventilators needed for patients with severe case of the respiratory illness.  \n WHO emergency programme head Michael Ryan said the need in Iran was "more acute" than for other countries.  \n While the case numbers in Iran appear to be bad, he said, "things tend to look worse before getting better."  \n The International Olympic Committee on Tuesday said the summer games in Tokyo set to begin on July 24 were still expected to happen despite Japan having nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths.  \n In the United States, there are now 108 people in 12 states with the coronavirus and six deaths in the Seattle area.  \n New York state reported its second case, a man in his 50s who works in Manhattan and has been hospitalized.  \n The public transportation agency in New York, the most densely populated major U.S. city of more than 8 million, said on Twitter it was deploying "enhanced sanitising procedures" for stations, train cars, buses and certain vehicles.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html) REUTERS \n '

It has spread from Wuhan, central China, to as far as the United States.\nThe virus struck as millions of Chinese prepared to travel for the Lunar New Year, heightening contagion risks.\n“If the pneumonia couldn’t be contained in the short term, we expect China’s retail sales, tourism, hotel and catering, travel activities likely to be hit, especially in Q1 and early Q2,” analysts at UBS said in a note on Wednesday.\n'
'888888,0,NEW YORK/ LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - New York state suffered another quick and brutal rise in the number of COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, staggering hospitals at the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, as California said it could be facing the next major wave of the disease.\nIn New York City, the densely packed home of more than 8 million people, healthcare officials tried to find hospital beds for the surging number of coronavirus patients as the statewide death toll rose to 210, with more than 25,600 confirmed cases.\nThe White House advised anyone who has visited or left New York to isolate themselves.\n“Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread to others, no matter where they have gone, whether it’s Florida, North Carolina or out to far reaches of Long Island,” Deborah Birx, who is helping lead the White House coronavirus tax force, said at a late-afternoon press conference.\nThe expected need for hospital beds in New York state at the peak of the outbreak has spiraled to 140,000, nearly three times what are available. Infections were now doubling every three days in New York and the worst could still be two to three weeks away, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\nNationwide, COVID-19, which broke out late last year in Wuhan, China, has infected more than 53,000 people and killed at least 720.\nPresident Donald Trump declared major disasters for New York and Washington state, the nation’s first hot spot and accounting for at least 117 deaths, and said he would soon do the same for California.\n“We are enduring a great national trial,” Trump said. The president softened a vow to reopen the nation’s economy by Easter, saying he’ll listen to experts first, including Birx and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nIn California, where 51 people have died and 2,200 tested positive, Governor Gavin Newsom said fully half the confirmed cases were between the ages of 18 and 49, figures he said are “a reminder for everybody to take this seriously.”\nNewsom cited the death of a teenage boy in Los Angeles County, although health officials there said the case was complex and an “alternate explanation” is possible.\nNewsom, who warned that half of Californians - or about 25 million people - could potentially be infected in the coming two months, said the next six to eight weeks would be pivotal in determining whether a clampdown on residents has slowed the spread of coronavirus.\nCalifornia also desperately lacks the hospital beds it needs to care for so many critically ill patients, Newsom has said, although Tesla co-founder Elon Musk “came through on his promise” to deliver over 1,000 badly needed hospital ventilators, and the state brought another 3,000 online.\nThe U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy was expected to arrive at in Los Angeles on Friday with 1,000 hospital beds to ease the burden on the state’s healthcare system.\nDespite the crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933 after U.S. lawmakers said they were close to a deal for a massive economic rescue package in response to the outbreak.\nThe World Health Organization said on Tuesday the United States had the potential to become the global epicenter of the pandemic, citing a “very large acceleration” in coronavirus infections.\nDemocrats, including Governor Cuomo, have criticized Trump, a Republican, for suggesting he would reopen the nation’s economy by mid-April.\n“If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it’s no contest. No American is going to say accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,” Cuomo said earlier in the day.\nNewsom did not criticize Trump but said April would be “sooner than any of the experts that I’ve talked to would believe is possible” for California to lift its restrictions.\nThe governors of at least 18 states in recent days have issued stay-at-home directives. The sweeping orders, unprecedented in their breadth and depth, encompass about half the nation’s population.\nThe rules are based on social distancing principles designed to put more space between individuals in order to slow the spread of the highly contagious and potentially lethal virus.\nEven before the first statewide controls went into effect last week in California, the coronavirus pandemic had virtually paralyzed sectors of the U.S. economy and upended daily lives of Americans as school districts and colleges canceled classes.\nAmericans reported frayed nerves after days of working from home, unable to take part in many activities and looking after children with no schools to attend.\nTerri Gilbert Thompson, 44, and her husband Scott, both teachers in Hilltown, Pennsylvania juggled teaching remotely with homeschooling their own three children.\n“It has been a challenge, but we are willing to make it work to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread,” Thompson said. “We’re doing our best to keep our students engaged in learning, monitor and enrich our own kids’ learning, while maintaining our own sanity during this challenging time.”\n'

'888888,0,The pictures look like stills from a Hollywood movie -- haunted-looking people in airports, surgical masks clamped to their faces, flimsy shields against the latest virus that threatens the world. The epicentre may be Wuhan, in China, where the virus was identified in early December, but cases of the deadly Coronavirus have been reported in over a dozen countries across the world, from Australia to the US, to Germany and Sri Lanka. In China, as of January 28, there have been 106 confirmed deaths. The virus, according to Chinese scientists, likely originates from bats with over a decade\'s worth of research showing that Coronaviruses in bats can cause human pandemics with unusual alacrity. This novel (as in new) Coronavirus, some scientists argue, might be even more dangerous to humans than others such as SARS, the viral respiratory disease that caused hundreds of deaths around the world in eight or so months from 2002 to 2003.\nIn India, three people were kept under observation in a Delhi hospital for possibly contracting the Coronavirus. The superintendent at the Delhi hospital told reporters that the men under observation had respiratory problems and had contracted coughs, colds and fevers. Other patients in hospitals from Jaipur to Kerala have also been kept under observation. A single case in neighbouring Nepal was reported on January 24. Government authorities say they are being vigilant, running thousands of checks on travellers from the many countries in which people have been affected by Coronaviruses, but some experts have called into question the preparedness of the country\'s medical system to deal with any extensive outbreak.\nMany have been critical of the Chinese government\'s response, which has veered from lackadaisical in December, when it claimed the Coronavirus was not being spread through people to people contact, to panicked now as it has effectively put tens of millions of people in quarantine. A few hundred Indians, mostly medical students, are currently in Wuhan. According to a tweet by Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, a plan is being put together to evacuate Indian nationals, though a waiting Air India passenger jet had, at the time of writing, yet to be dispatched. Other countries, including Japan and the US, have also made plans to evacuate their nationals. Any \'rescue\' plan, though, needs to be sanctioned by Chinese authorities, since Wuhan has been sealed off from the rest of the country. On January 27, a man died in Beijing, the first fatality in the Chinese capital.\nIn response to the Coronavirus, many countries have recommended that their nationals not travel to China. The health ministry has recommended that non-essential travel to China be postponed and that Indians in China should "follow simple public health measures", including frequent hand-washing and covering their mouths when coughing. Despite fears expressed about Indian preparedness, the authorities in various states insist they are taking necessary precautions. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan pointed out that despite scares and some hundreds of patients being tested and observed, there had still not been any report of a verified case of the Coronavirus in India.\nThis may be premature, given the rate at which countries around the world are reporting incidences. Nonetheless, the death toll has, so far, been confined to China, with the fatality rate remaining steady at less than three per cent. The Centre has also set up a 24-hour helpline, and has been thermal screening passengers at select airports. But the government admits it is also reliant on people -- particularly those who have travelled to China -- monitoring symptoms that are quite broad and can easily be mistaken for a regular cold, cough or respiratory illness, not uncommon in India, particularly in the pollution-ridden cities of the north. The advice given by authorities such as the National Disaster Management Authority has been broad and bland, encouraging good personal hygiene and attention to diet, exercise and sleep patterns.\nSuch advice is evidence that the authorities do not yet fully understand the novel Coronavirus. Work on a vaccine has begun, with the hope that experience gained in dealing with SARS will hasten the process. Even in a best-case scenario, though, any putative vaccine would take months to develop. As of now, the World Health Organization has stopped short of describing the Coronavirus as an international public health emergency, though it acknowledged that its previous assessment of the risk posed internationally was understated. Google trends have shown that while international interest in the Coronavirus has led to much internet browsing, people in Australia, Canada, India and the US, in particular, have been confusing or associating the virus with Corona beer, with searches for \'Coronavirus beer\', \'Corona virus beer\', and \'Virus Corona beer\' spiking spectacularly over the past couple of weeks.\nPerhaps, a weak smile is still the only appropriate response to worldwide apprehension. Alarmingly, a new global health security index, released in October 2019, suggested that "not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic". India scored above the global average, although not as highly as developed economies, and still its score was only 46.5 out of a possible 100. We are, the Chinese experience has shown, uniquely vulnerable to the Coronavirus, with people to people contact across international borders facilitating the contagion. As China is finding out, quarantining a country is nigh on impossible.\n'

'888888,0,SEOUL - In late January, South Korean health officials summoned representatives from more than 20 medical companies from their lunar New Year celebrations to a conference room tucked inside Seoul’s busy train station.  \n One of the country’s top infectious disease officials delivered an urgent message: South Korea needed an effective test immediately to detect the novel coronavirus, then running rampant in China. He promised the companies swift regulatory approval.  \n Though there were only four known cases in South Korea at that point, “we were very nervous. We believed that it could develop into a pandemic,” one attendee, Lee Sang-won, an infectious diseases expert at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters.  \n “We acted like an army,” he said.  \n A week after the Jan. 27 meeting, South Korea\'s CDC approved one company’s diagnostic test. Another company soon followed. By the end of February, South Korea was making headlines around the world for its drive-through screening centers and ability to test thousands of people daily.  \n South Korea’s swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. New cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.  \n The United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea’s, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.  \n As a result, U.S. officials don’t fully grasp how many Americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. While more than 7,000 U.S. cases had been identified as of Wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in coming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the American Hospital Association by Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  \n “You cannot fight what you cannot see,” said Roger Klein, a former laboratory medical director at the Cleveland Clinic and previously an adviser to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on clinical laboratory issues.  \n How the United States fell so far behind South Korea, according to infectious disease experts, clinicians and state and local officials, is a tale of many contrasts in the two nations’ public health systems: a streamlined bureaucracy versus a congested one, bold versus cautious leadership, and a sense of urgency versus a reliance on protocol.  \n The delayed and chaotic testing in the United States will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. Already more than 100 people have died overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the U.S. economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life.  \n "It makes me feel like I’m living in a farce,” said Dr. Ritu Thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Even hospital staff who may have been exposed can’t get a test, she said. “We are a rich country but we don’t have these kinds of things?”  \n The administration of President Donald Trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. Instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as South Korea did, U.S. health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of which proved faulty. Then, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn’t approve tests other than the CDC’s until Feb. 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun.  \n Meanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.  \n South Korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. By contrast, the United States’ FDA said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of Americans.  \n “There are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told Reuters. “But one thing I will stand firm on: We cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.”  \n In a statement, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said, “This process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.” But he said “more and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system’s ability to detect and respond to cases.”  \n Bombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, Trump vowed on Friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. This week, the FDA said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency’s revised policy.  \n But it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need.  \n “The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a House committee last week. “That is a failing. Let’s admit it.”  \n It’s a problem many Americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom.  \n “I don’t know how we messed this up so badly,” said Ruth Blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn\'t get a coronavirus test on Saturday in an urgent care clinic outside Rochester, New York, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. ”We got caught flat-footed. For America, that’s unacceptable.”  \n  \n ‘HURRY UP AND DEVELOP THE KITS’  \n At the pivotal Jan. 27 meeting at the Seoul train station, South Korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for takeoff.  \n “They were told that the ‘emergency use authorization’ would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,” said Lee Hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, who was at the meeting.  \n One of the companies was Kogene Biotech Co Ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. The government announced its approval on Feb. 4.  \n “The government acted quickly,” said Myoah Baek, an executive director at Kogene. The Korean CDC “disclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.”  \n Lee Hyukmin of the Korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless.  \n “Of course, a kit that’s approved in one week isn’t as good as one that goes through a year of clinical trials,” he said. So in the early days, Lee said, the government cross-checked cases to ensure the tests were working properly.  \n Cross-checking involved verifying that labs got the same result the government did on an initial pool of patient samples. As of last week, nearly 100 labs were available to perform tests nationwide, according to government figures.  \n South Korea’s rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past.  \n In the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of MERS, short for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, critics slammed then-President Park Geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. Public confidence waned in Park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal.  \n The country had 186 MERS cases, more than anywhere outside the Middle East, including 38 deaths.  \n “We can\'t ever forget the incident. It is engraved in our mind,” the Korean CDC’s Lee Sang-won said. “We were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.”  \n  \n ‘A REAL FOUL UP’  \n On Jan. 31, only days after the Seoul train station meeting, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the World Health Organization.  \n HHS oversees the separate operations of the FDA and CDC, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. The CDC was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. Then, under longstanding protocols, the FDA needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. Private labs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the CDC version.  \n On Feb. 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the FDA hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. Regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the FDA.  \n Though coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. It was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their Powerpoint presentations.  \n In his remarks, Dr. Timothy Stenzel, who oversees the FDA’s review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency’s mission to protect public health: “It\'s our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.”  \n Carolyn Hiller, a program director at the Medical Device Innovation Consortium, which hosted the event alongside FDA, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead.  \n "The whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,” she said.  \n Stenzel did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the FDA acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a “specific topic on the agenda.” But it said the agency already was talking to test developers and “the conference was timely and addressed issues important” to firms and institutions looking to produce a test.  \n The following day, Feb. 4, the FDA greenlighted a CDC test kit for the virus.  \n Weeks of chaos would follow.  \n By Feb. 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the CDC’s test wasn’t working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. Three days later, the CDC told the labs that it was manufacturing a new component.  \n As of mid-February, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. The CDC was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn’t immediately deploy their own without the FDA’s blessing.  \n HHS said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the CDC’s initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency’s lab. The precise problem has not been identified.  \n The CDC didn’t send out new test kits until late February. Meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people.  \n The U.S. emergency declaration issued in late January created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in testing, according to former federal officials and lab professionals.  \n The declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for COVID-19. But public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the CDC.  \n That’s because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher.  \n "Paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals," said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. “There was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the United States\' pandemic response plan.”  \n Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the CDC and FDA stuck to their conventional playbook for too long.  \n “Traditional public health thinking is,‘Don’t create widespread panic and don’t go over the top. Keep the testing narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,’” Schaffner said. “That failed in this instance. This virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the U.S. system. South Korea had a much better sense of what was happening.”  \n In a statement Tuesday, the CDC said: “After finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, CDC began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem …. CDC, in conjunction with FDA, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.”  \n The CDC statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays.  \n The CDC was “not an impediment” to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. That was the role of the FDA, and as the initial U.S. cases were being detected in late January and early February, CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the CDC statement.  \n Alberto Gutierrez, who led the FDA’s office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. “There is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,” Gutierrez said. "The problem the FDA faces is, do you let it become the Wild West?”  \n “The FDA had good intentions,” he said.  \n  \n RAMPING UP  \n As U.S. efforts faltered, South Korean officials cleared a test from a second company, Seegene Inc, on Feb. 12.  \n With many more tests in hand, health officials were well armed to attack a fast-moving virus and aggressively track down people who may have been exposed. This testing-backed offensive helped South Korea reduce the number of new cases over a matter of weeks, serving as a model for other countries grappling with the pandemic.  \n In mid-February, cases spiked at a secretive church in the southeastern city of Daegu. On Feb. 26, Daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms.  \n As of March 10, Daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. The city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in South Korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. On Wednesday, officials announced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on Feb. 29.  \n The country went from two approved test makers on Feb. 18 to five as of last week, according to the Korean CDC.  \n “To my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,” Korean CDC’s Lee Sang-won said.  \n  \n PLEADING WITH WASHINGTON  \n By Feb. 24, state and local labs in the United States were pleading with the FDA to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the CDC for testing. They asked Hahn, the FDA commissioner, for “enforcement discretion” so they could use their own lab-developed tests.  \n “We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories,” Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and Grace Kubin, lab services director at the Texas Department of State Health Services, wrote to Hahn on Feb. 24 in a letter reviewed by Reuters.  \n In an interview, Becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a “Hail Mary” pass, an act of desperation.  \n “The entire lab community was really coming unglued. We knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung” Becker told Reuters.  \n He said labs wanted FDA to make more tests available so they could run more patient samples at a faster pace.  \n Two days after receiving Becker’s letter, the FDA commissioner said his agency was ready to approve new outside tests quickly - if its requirements for accuracy were satisfied.  \n “False diagnostic test results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences,” Hahn wrote to the Association of Public Health Laboratories in a Feb. 26 letter, “not only serious implications for individual patient care but also serious implications for the analyses of disease progression and for public health decision-making.”  \n Under increasing pressure, the FDA relented and removed many of the bureaucratic obstacles. On Feb. 29, the agency said public and private labs, including academic medical centers, could start using their own tests before the FDA had completed its full review. Laboratories had 15 business days to submit a completed application, which could be approved retroactively.  \n That same day, the Trump administration confirmed the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in Washington state.  \n On March 2, Stenzel at the FDA’s diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. Some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel.  \n As U.S. regulators rewrote their policies, South Korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their cars.  \n At a closed-door meeting last week in Congress, U.S. Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, pressed the FDA commissioner and other members of the Trump administration on why South Korea was lapping the United States in its response.  \n “Why don’t we have drive-through testing like South Korea?” Ruiz asked leaders of the president’s coronavirus task force.  \n Ruiz told Reuters the officials said they were working on it. On their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in Colorado, New York, Texas and elsewhere.  \n In recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, Trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies. The FDA launched a 24-hour hotline for laboratories needing help to accelerate testing, approved two company applications for higher-volume testing and granted states the flexibility to authorize new tests so labs can bypass the FDA.  \n Despite the new moves, Ruiz said he fears America is still weeks away from approaching what South Korea has accomplished. “I think months have been lost here,” Ruiz said. “Maybe we should look into purchasing South Korea’s tests.”  \n That may happen. Both Kogene and SolGent Co, two of the COVID-19 test-makers approved in South Korea, said their companies have an eye on the U.S. market.  \n “The FDA asked us to proceed with applications quickly,” Kogene executive Myoah Baek said.

'888888,0,The European Commission said this Thursday that it would be following the development of the Chinese coronavirus, which has already caused 17 deaths, ensuring that it is ready to take preventive measures to prevent contagion in the European Union (EU).\n"The Commission is following the situation very closely and we continue to coordinate the measures that may be needed at EU level," said EU executive Stefan de Keersmaecker this Thursday, speaking at the daily press conference of the institution in Brussels.\nAccording to the responsible party, "the Commission is ready to take whatever precautions are necessary to comply with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation [WHO], adopted at today\'s meeting" of that entity.\nStefan de Keersmaecker specified that, this morning, the European Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides, talked to the WHO Director-General and the French and Italian Health Ministers about this virus.\nIn addition, according to this spokesman, internal meetings are taking place in the European Commission on the subject.\n"Yesterday [Wednesday], the Commission held a second meeting of the public health committee, which discussed the level of risk and potential consequences for the EU", exemplified Stefan de Keersmaecker.\nThe virus is still being monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, a European body that identifies health threats and that has "increased the risk of this virus entering the EU from bottom to moderate", said the spokesman, explaining that this was due to the risk of transmission from person to person.\nThe new virus causing viral pneumonias was detected in China at the end of 2019 and has already infected several hundred people and caused death to at least 25\nYeah.\nThis is a new type of coronavirus, which is transmitted between animals and passed on to humans, and there are already records of individual transmission to human beings, but still in totally substantiated circumstances.\nThe first cases of the "2019 --nCoV" virus appeared in mid-December in the Chinese town of Whuan, when people with viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals. It was found that all people were often working or visiting Huanan\'s seafood and meat market in the same city. The exact origin of the infection is still unknown, but it would have been infected animals, which are marketed alive, transmitting it to humans.\nSymptoms of these coronaviruses ar e more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress, including shortness of breath.\nThe WHO decided on Wednesday to extend until this Thursday the meeting of the Emergency Committee to decide whether the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China is declaring an international public health emergency.\n'
'888888,0,According to Reuters, Wuhan has been closed for more than two months since April 8, which will promote the resumption of work and production in different regions and levels.\nAccording to the report, it has been two months since Wuhan began to "close the city" at 10:00 on January 23. However, the central government pointed out that "there is still a risk of sporadic cases and local outbreaks", and that a new confirmed case in Wuhan yesterday was a doctor who did not rule out nosocomial infection, which, combined with the spread of overseas epidemics and the increasing risk of import, means that China cannot be taken lightly in preventing the recurrence of local epidemics or import from abroad.\nThe novel coronavirus pneumonia control command of Hubei Province issued a circular on Tuesday. From 0:00 in April 8th, Wuhan lifted the control measures from Han to Yue channel, and orderly resumed external traffic. The Han people were transported safely and orderly by the "green code" of Hubei health code.\nAccording to the assessment of epidemic risk level and on the premise of epidemic prevention and control, Wuhan city will promote the enterprises to return to work and production in different areas and in different periods and conditions. Outside of Wuhan, the control of the exit passageway will be lifted from 0:00 on March 25, and the external traffic will be restored in an orderly manner. The personnel who leave Hubei will flow in an orderly and safe manner with the Hubei health code "green code". As for the personnel from other provinces who come to Hubei Province and come to Han Dynasty, with the health code of other provinces or the "green code" of Hubei health code, they can flow safely and orderly in the whole province, and do not need to provide additional health certificate (except for those who are unable to apply for the health code), flow certificate, application approval form or acceptance certificate of the place of inflow, vehicle pass, etc.\nReported yesterday that novel coronavirus pneumonia leader Li Keqiang, head of the State Council and the Central Committee of the State Council, chaired a leading group meeting, saying that the current spread of the national epidemic situation in Wuhan, which is the main battleground, has basically been blocked. Sporadic sporadic cases and the risk of partial outbreaks are still there. The epidemic is widespread in the world. The situation is still complex and severe. Clear head, never take lightly. We should implement the overall prevention and control strategy of "external defense input and internal defense rebound", and maintain the hard won prevention and control achievements.\nWuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission said earlier that on March 23, one newly confirmed case was found in the city. The patient was a doctor of the provincial people\'s Hospital (Headquarters), who was working in the hospital recently, and the hospital infection was not excluded. At 0-24 o\'clock on March 23, 345 visits were made to fever clinics in the city, 11 fewer than the day before, including 210 first visits. On March 23, 10441 nucleic acids were detected in the cit。\nYesterday, financial news, China\'s domestic financial media, said that after confirming to people in the disease control department, "the notice on the suspension of the national and provincial aid teams for Disease Control in Hubei Province" was true. The report quoted a person close to China\'s CDC as saying that the suspension of the withdrawal of the teams from the CDC was a national level "temporarily uneasy about the situation in Wuhan and Hubei", allowing the anti epidemic team to stay for several days and keep alert.\nReuters said the situation of asymptomatic people infected with the new coronavirus was of greater concern. If the zero growth of confirmed cases can be maintained and stabilized, the disease control team can withdraw in the next step. "There are still a few or a dozen asymptomatic positive cases detected every day, and it\'s not clear whether the transmission in Wuhan has been completely blocked," the report quoted disease control experts as saying.\nIn March 20th, the novel coronavirus Pneumonia Control Department of Hubei Province issued the above notice, and coordinated the work of the new crown pneumonia epidemic prevention and control command to coordinate the state and the provincial AIDS control teams to depart from Hubei, and to undertake the related business according to the original plan.\nHowever, Wu Hao, leader of the community prevention and control expert group of the prevention and control group of the front working group of the national health and Health Commission, was quoted by CCTV news microblog as saying that it should not be misunderstood as the rebound or aggravation of the epidemic situation that the emergency rescue team of Hubei Province should be suspended. The disease control team came with the medical teams from all provinces. The two tasks for the disease control team to stay in Hubei are: first, to do a good job in preparation, emergency plan handling and killing before returning to work, second, to carry out a large training for the relevant medical and administrative personnel in Hubei Province, so as to leave a disease control team that can fight well.\nTu Yuanchao, deputy director of Hubei health and Health Commission, was quoted by CCTV yesterday as saying that according to the national health and Health Commission\'s monitoring of "Fuyang" patients and the preliminary study of experts, no "Fuyang" patients have been found to infect people, but a designated hospital has been deployed to carry out clinical observation on "Fuyang" patients, and disease control departments are required to carry out epidemiological follow-up investigation on patients , relevant scientific research institutions carry out virus culture or virus load monitoring on patients\' samples to further clarify the infectious problem of "Fuyang" patients'
'888888,0,China on Monday hoped that India will not put trade restrictions and limit movement of people to the country in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic in its Hubei province.\nIn an interview to PTI, Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong said that China\'s foreign ministry and local governments are working hard to ensure the safety of Indians and people working in Indian diplomatic missions in China.\nAdmitting that there could be a short-term impact of the epidemic on China\'s economy, Sun Weidong said that the country\'s internal resilience is growing and it has ample resources and policy tools to cope with economic volatility.\n"I am confident that it should not and will not be hindered by short-term difficulties. We should not suspend but expand the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries," Sun Weidong said.\nIn the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, India has put restrictions on the movement of people to and from China, like many other countries, as part of precautionary measures to contain spread of the virus.\nThe death toll in China because of the virus has gone up to 490 while the number of confirmed cases has touched 24,300.\nThe WHO has declared a global health emergency after coronavirus cases were reported in several parts of the globe.\n"We hope that the Indian citizens will not overreact or panic over the outbreak. It is better to remain rational and calm, and judge China\'s prevention and control efforts with objectivity and compassion," Sun Weidong said.\nSun Weidong said that China, a "responsible" country, is not only protecting the health of its people but also that of people around the world.\n"We need your understanding and support for the cooperation between China and India in epidemic control to ensure normal personnel exchanges and trade between the two countries," Sun Weidong said\n.\n"China is ready to continue to work with India, strengthen communication and coordination, and safeguard the health and safety of Indian citizens in China," Sun Weidong added.\nOn the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China\'s economy, Sun said there was no need to be pessimistic about the country\'s economy as its fundamentals remain unchanged.\nSun Weidong said the Chinese government has ample resources and policy tools to cope with economic volatility and the long-term "positive trend" of the Chinese economy will not be impacted by the outbreak of the virus.\n"China has rich experience in successfully dealing with SARS and the international financial crisis. This time will be no exception. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva recently expressed confidence that the Chinese government has sufficient policy space to stabilize economic growth," Sun Weidong said.\nSun Weidong also mentioned a telephone conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Wi and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar last week on ways to deal with the situation arising out of the outbreak of the virus.\n"In the telephone conversation, Wang said that to address transnational public health challenges in this era of globalisation, we need to stay objective and rational, and step up communication and coordination, and that all should play a constructive role," Sun Weidong said.\nSun Weidong added that Jaishankar had conveyed that it is important to evaluate the outbreak in an objective and rational manner and not take actions that may complicate the situation.\nOn Saturday, 324 Indians were brought back from Wuhan, while another batch of 323 Indians and seven Maldivians were evacuated from the Chinese city on Sunday.\nSun Weidong said that a declaration of public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak in China is not a vote of no-confidence on China\n.\n"When the director general of WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, it emphasised that it does not recommend any travel or trade restriction. This declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but to take care of other countries with relatively poor sanitary conditions. It is not a vote of no confidence in China," Sun Weidong said.\n'
'888888,0,On March 26, the "virtual G20 summit" - the online summit of the world\'s most developed and influential national leaders was held. Media. Tasis collected the strongest news reaction.\nU.S.A\nCNBC: "20 countries are committed to unite to fight the Colorado virus and announce that they will inject $5 trillion into the world economy to deal with the epidemic in the event of an epidemic.
