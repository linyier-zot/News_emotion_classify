They\'re still an imitation of your dear friends. On his return from Miami (United States), he contracted, unfortunately, the mental virus, which is infecting friendship between our people", wrote the embassy on the official account on the social network Twitter in response to Jair Bolsonaro\'s son.\nThe Chinese ambassador to Brazil, Yang Wanming, also demanded that Eduardo Bolsonaro "withdraw immediately" the words and "apologize to the Chinese people".\nEduardo Bolsonaro, who is a federal deputy, used the Twitter account to blame the Chinese Communist Party for the pandemic, which compared to the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine at the time part of the former Soviet UnioYeah.\nAccording to the son of the Brazilian President, China chose to "hide something serious" rather than respond promptly and avoid thousands of deaths. Whoever watched Chernobyl will understand what happened. Replace the nuclear power plant with the coronavirus and the Soviet dictatorship with the Chinese one. Once again a dictatorship preferred to hide something serious than expose and suffer wear and tear, but that would save countless lives,"he said. It is China\'s fault and freedom would be the solution,"he said.\nThe son of Jair Bolsonaro also reacted to the response of Chinese diplomacy, noting that "stimulating debate is the function of the Brazilian parliamentarian".\n"Stimulating the debate is the function of the Brazilian parliamentarian, which is why he has the prerogative of parliamentary immunity (art. 53, CF) as a constitutional guarantee for Members to exercise such a right", stated Eduardo Brasileiro, in response to a communication from the Chinese embassy in Brazil, via the social network Twitter.\nThe Brazilian federal congressman stressed that he never offended the Chinese people and that such an interpretation is "totally inappropriate." I explain that I share the message that criticises the Chinese Government\'s actions in preventing the pandemic mainly in sharing information that would have been useful in preventing it on a global scale,"Eduardo Bolsonaro said.\nHe added: "Even living in a democracy with broad freedom of the press and expression, I have not identified any deconstruction of my arguments on the part of the Chinese ambassador in Brazil. This one just exhibited irritation with my post and misdirected his energies in sharing offensive posts to my family\'s honour- this is indeed a serious and disproportionate fact.\nChina is Brazil\'s largest trading partner.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON - The Trump administration is asking Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus, including more than $1 billion for vaccines, the White House said on Monday.  \n With financial markets falling on concerns that the virus will have a significant impact on the global economy, the Trump administration is eager to show it is prepared to combat the virus despite the limited number of cases so far in the United States.  \n The virus has spread to some 29 countries and territories beyond mainland China, with outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy. [L3N2AO07M]  \n "The Trump administration continues to take the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus Disease very seriously. Today, the administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies," said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.  \n The money will be used for therapeutics, vaccine development and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks, the White House said.  \n Of the $2.5 billion request, $1.5 billion represents new funding. The rest would come from funds already budgeted by Congress, such as unused money to fight the Ebola virus. The administration requires congressional approval to redirect that money to fight the coronavirus.  \n House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a Democrat, said in a statement the Trump administration\'s funding request was "woefully insufficient to protect Americans from the deadly coronavirus outbreak."  \n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late on Monday that the supplemental funding requested by Trump is "undersized" and "completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency".  \n "The House will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis," Pelosi said in a statement.  \n The United States has not seen the virus spread through its communities the way that China and other countries have experienced, but health officials are preparing for the possibility even as Americans affected so far have been quarantined.  \n There have been 53 confirmed U.S. cases of the new coronavirus so far - 14 in people diagnosed in the United States and 39 among Americans repatriated from the outbreak\'s epicentre of Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \n  \n TRAVEL WARNING  \n U.S. health officials have warned that cases among repatriated citizens will likely increase.  \n The CDC warned Americans on Monday to avoid travel to South Korea because of the virus.  \n "We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country," White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters earlier on Monday.  \n Trump has been at odds with his own White House advisers over China\'s coronavirus response. He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.  \n Trump has praised the work of Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as his advisers have questioned the reliability of the information Beijing has shared on the virus and expressed frustration over its reluctance to accept U.S. expertise in combating it.  \n The Trump administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.  \n In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a "rapidly evolving situation," but said the Alabama centre was "not needed at this time" and that it was looking for alternatives.

Xi Jinping: I have been conducting in person.\nThe report said that when Li Keqiang was appointed leader of the CPC Central Committee to deal with the new type of coronavirus infection pneumonia leading group, the French international radio station Chinese network said that after Xi Jinping took power, he was almost the leader of all important members of the Communist Party of China, but this group leader against Wuhan pneumonia fell on Li Keqiang\'s shoulder.\nWith the increasingly severe pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee rarely held a meeting on the first day of the new year, and decided to establish this new leading group.\nAccording to CCTV China, Xi Jinping met with Tan Desai at the Great Hall of the people on 28 July. He said: "for the Chinese people, we are now carrying out a serious struggle." According to Xi Jinping, "the Chinese government attaches great importance to it, because the aim of the government is to put people\'s safety and health in the highest position. Therefore, I have been conducting and deploying the epidemic prevention and control work in person. I believe that as long as we have firm confidence, work together in the same boat, carry out scientific prevention and control, and make precise measures, we will surely overcome the epidemic. "\nThe report said, but Xinhua reported later that "Xi Jinping stressed that the Chinese people are fighting a serious battle with the new coronavirus infection of pneumonia. People\'s life safety and health are always the first, and epidemic prevention and control is the most important work at present. On the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, I presided over the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made a comprehensive plan for strengthening epidemic prevention and control, established the central leading group for epidemic response, unified leadership, unified command, and classified guidance for all localities to do a good job in epidemic prevention and control. "\nAccording to the report, the outbreak out of control has caused a lot of public resentment in China. Zhao Kezhi, China\'s minister of public security, told a national video conference of public security organs on Tuesday to crack down on all kinds of illegal acts of slander and slander, Xinhua reported. We will improve our political position and resolutely safeguard the overall social stability.\n'
'888888,0,Shares opened sharply higher in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 with Congress and the White House nearing a deal on injecting nearly $2 trillion of aid into an economy ravaged by the coronavirus.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 per cent, while Hong Kong added 3 per cent and Sydney climbed 3.6 per cent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 per cent.\nThe Dow burst 11.4 per cent higher, while the more closely followed S&P 500 index leaped 9.4 per cent as a wave of buying around the world interrupted what has been a brutal month of nearly nonstop selling. Investors released some frustration that had pent up over days of watching the US Senate stalemate over the crucial rescue package.\nDespite the gains, investors were far from saying markets have hit bottom. Rallies nearly as big as this have punctuated the last few weeks, and none lasted more than a day. Economists and investors alike are still expecting to see some dire economic numbers in the days and weeks ahead.\nToday was a good day, but we would not necessarily see this as turnaround time, said Adam Taback, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans said Tuesday they’re close to agreeing on a massive economic rescue package, which will include payments to US households and aid for small businesses and the travel industry, among other things. A vote in the Senate could come later Tuesday or Wednesday.\nInvestors were imploring Congress to act, particularly as the Federal Reserve has done nearly all it can to sustain markets, including its latest round of extraordinary aid launched Monday.\n"It’s sort of like, keep the patient alive in the emergency room so you can provide some treatment options," said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.\nThe Dow rose 2,112.98 points, its biggest point gain in history, to 20,704.91. The S&P 500, which is much more important to most 401(k) accounts, rose 209.93, or 9.4 per cent, to 2,447.33 for its third-biggest percentage gain since World War II. The Nasdaq composite jumped 557.18 points, or 8.1 per cent, to 7,417.86.\nIn Asia early Wednesday, Tokyo’s Nikkei was at 19,053.40, while the Hang Seng rose to 23,374.57. South Korea’s Kospi gained 4.2 per cent to 1,678.13 and the S&P/ASX 200 picked up 3.6 per cent to 4,906.10. Taiwan’s benchmark jumped 4.4 per cent.\nUS crude oil gained 88 cents to $24.89 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, added 91 cents to $30.65 per barrel.\nIn currency trading, the US dollar was at 110.90 Japanese yen, down from 111.22 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0803 from $1.0790.\nEarlier share rebounds have evaporated. Since stocks began selling off on Feb. 20, the S&P 500 has had six days where it’s risen, and all but one of them were big gains of more than 4 per cent. Afterward, stocks fell an average of 5% the next day.\n"One of the things to be careful about is thinking this will be the panacea or that this fiscal response will be sufficient," said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management.\nUltimately, investors say they need to see the number of new infections peak before markets can find a floor. The increasing spread is forcing companies to park airplanes, shut hotels and close restaurants to dine-in customers.\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual town hall that he hopes to open up the economy by Easter. Analysts said the pronouncement wasn’t a contributor to the day’s huge rally, which was mostly due to the stimulus hopes.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. Severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems. Recovery could take six weeks in such cases.\nEconomists are topping each other’s dire forecasts for how much the economy will shrink this spring due to the closures of businesses, and a growing number say a recession seems inevitable.\nSome of the market’s areas hardest hit by the closures, though, led the way higher Tuesday as expectations rose for incoming aid from the US government.\nNorwegian Cruise Lines, MGM Resorts and American Airlines Group were all up at least 33 per cent. Energy companies and banks were also strong, though all remain well below where they were a month ago.\nGovernments and central banks in other countries around the world are unveiling unprecedented levels of support for their economies in an attempt to limit the scale of the upcoming virus-related slump. Germany, a bastion of budgetary discipline, also approved a big fiscal boost.\nThe gains came even as the first reports arrived showing how badly the outbreak is hitting the global economy. In the United States, a preliminary reading on business activity in March showed the steepest contraction on record, going back to 2009. Reports were also gloomy for Europe.\nEveryone was prepared for a set of shockers, and that is precisely what we got, but they are not a surprise, said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. It is at times like this that the market’s propensity to look forward is demonstrated most effectively.\nMore gloomy data is nearly assuredly on the way. On Thursday, economists expect a report to show the number of Americans applying for jobless claims easily set a record last week. Some say the number could be way beyond 1 million, amid a wave of layoffs, topping the prior record of 695,000 set in 1982.\nHelping to lift sentiment in markets was news from China that it is preparing to lift the lockdown in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and from Italy reporting a reduction in the number of new cases and coronavirus-related deaths.\n"It’s still early days, of course -- perhaps investors can start to envisage life beyond the coronavirus," said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe. That could make stocks look a little more attractive, although anyone jumping back in now will need to have nerves of steel.\nDespite Tuesday’s big gains, it’s no time to get complacent, said Wells Fargo’s Taback.\n"We would caution that the danger is not all behind us at this point, he said. We still have not seen numbers that give us an indication of just how bad things are."\n'

The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 with about 2,000 deaths.  \n The head of a leading hospital in China\'s central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the novel virus first appeared at the end of last year.  \n Illustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains.  \n World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data "appears to show a decline in new cases" but any apparent trend "must be interpreted very cautiously."  \n Outside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.  \n Tedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.  \n "We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship," he said.  \n Russia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens.  \n By the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.  \n "Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours," Tedros said.  \n China says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.  \n The WHO\'s Mike Ryan said China had success with "putting out the fire" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored.  \n "Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one," Ryan said  \n The numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain\'s University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.  \n Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.  \n  \n GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS  \n Despite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China\'s ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be "limited, short-term and manageable" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.  \n Chinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.  \n Economists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.  \n "The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we\'ll see a big round of layoffs," said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.  \n Britain\'s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.  \n Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world, and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.  \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.  \n Singapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.  \n Japan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.

Symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.\nAbout Because these symptoms are similar to many other respiratory diseases, more screening is needed.\n'
'888888,0,SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - American passengers were taken off a cruise liner on Sunday to fly home after being quarantined for two weeks off Japan, while China said the rate of new coronavirus cases had slowed, calling that proof its steps to fight the outbreak were working.\nAn announcement aboard the Diamond Princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since Feb. 3, told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship.\nOf the roughly 400 Americans on the cruise, more than 40 are infected with the virus and will stay in Japan for treatment, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n“They are not going to go anywhere. They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan,” Fauci told the CBS News program “Face the Nation.” “People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the United States.”\nKyodo News Agency said the flights carrying U.S. passengers left Haneda Airport at around 1700 ET (2200 GMT).\nCanadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers.\n“Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,” U.S. passenger Gay Courter told Reuters.\nSeventy new coronavirus cases were confirmed on board, bringing the total on the ship to 355, by far the largest cluster of cases outside China. Fauci told the Washington Post there were 44 infected Americans.\nWithin China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit.\n“The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the Health Commission, told reporters.\nThe new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who traveled from Chinese cities, with five deaths.\nThe coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in China’s central province of Hubei. China’s response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown.\nMi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical.\nMark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Britain’s University of Edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in Hubei, “then this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too”.\nBut he added: “We should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure.”\nDeclining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in Wuhan, he said.\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted.\nOn board the Diamond Princess, American passenger Matthew Smith posted a photo on Twitter showing buses parked on the shore to take U.S. nationals to the airport.

'888888,0,GENEVA — Chinese scientists are testing two antiviral drugs against the new coronavirus and preliminary clinical trial results are weeks away, the co-chair of a World Health Organization (WHO) meeting said on Wednesday (Feb 12). \n Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, a former WHO virologist, co-chaired the two-day, closed-door research forum in Geneva of more than 300 scientists and researchers, including some who took part virtually from China and Taiwan. \n "The Chinese colleagues are very eager to participate in protocols which are being defined so that all the clinical trials are done according to the same standards and are looking towards the same outcome," she told a news conference. "They were very interested in working on such a master protocol." \n The coronavirus, now dubbed Covid-19, that emerged in central China in December has infected more than 44,000 people and killed over 1,100 in China and has spread to at least 24 other countries. \n Dr Kieny said quite a number of patients have already been dosed with a combination of the antiviral drugs ritonavir and lopinavir, but she did not have an exact count. \n It "would be excellent if it would work because this drug is available in particular as a generic formulation for the treatment of HIV, so this would clearly be a drug that would be available," Dr Kieny said. \n The combination HIV therapy is sold under the brand name Kaletra by AbbVie Inc. \n It remains to be seen whether the treatment will prove effective against the new virus, she said. "We don\'t know the result, and we still have to wait for a few days, or a few weeks to have a result." \n A state-run Chinese research institute applied last week for a patent on the use of the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir from US-based Gilead Sciences Inc, which scientists hope may be effective against the coronavirus. \n "They will very soon start to dose patients on remdesivir ... which had been tested without much success with Ebola, but Ebola virus and coronavirus are different and it may have a better success with corona," Dr Kieny said. \n "But we will have to wait for a few weeks whether this gives any positive signal."

'888888,0,Worrying about the global economy is growing with the spread of the new Coronavirus in China. According to a study, the virus could be harmful to the global automotive industry.\nThe German Bundesbank sees risks for the German economy. According to the head of the Institute for the World Economy (IfW), Gabriel Felbermayr, the damage is "disproportionately greater" with each day production plants in the second largest economy in the world are shut down. Producers in Germany and other countries were dependent on Chinese inputs, stocks did not last forever, Felbermayr told the "Trade Sheet" (Monday).\nA temporary decline in overall economic demand in China could dampen German exports, the German Bundesbank explained in the current monthly report. China is an important market for "Made in Germany" goods.\nAt the same time, many products are produced there, including for further processing in other countries. Security precautions for the virus could affect some global value chains, the monthly report said. "Supply bottlenecks in individual industries in the country would be the consequence," wrote the Bundesbank experts.\nFrom the point of view of the RWI Leibniz Institute of Economic Research, the economic impact of the epidemic depends on how long production in China is hampered.\n"In our estimation, economic growth in China in the first quarter could be dampened by approximately 2.5 percent," economic experts Roland Dhrurn told dpa. Compared to the previous year, it would only be between three and four percent instead of six percent as expected. "This development will also be noticeable in Germany, in particular through lower exports and a steady supply of pre-products by Chinese suppliers," explained DhrurnYeah.\nAccording to a study, the Sars-CoV-2 virus could be harmful to the global automotive industry. Only in the particularly affected Chinese province of Hubei, nearly two million cars per year would be produced in over a dozen locations, according to the analysis of the consulting company BCG.\nThe new Coronavirus has already affected many industries, it is said, the study of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). "But the car industry stands out as one that feels the effects quickly and deeply in view of China\'s crucial role." Thus, the country is the largest market for new cars and, at the same time, an important location for manufacturers and suppliers. "The automotive industry will be affected locally and around the globe," writes the consultants with a view to disrupted supply chains.\nFor German manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Volkswagen and Porsche, China is the most important market. At VW, the People\'s Republic represents a good 40-percent of deliveries. And when it comes to converting to electric cars, the corporations depend on battery cells from China. US manufacturers also depend on the Far East: GM sells more cars in China than in the USA, BCG said.\nThe new lung disease has already hit the German car companies. For example, because of the Coronavirus BMW had extended the Chinese New Year holidays at its world\'s largest location in the millionth city of Shenyang.\nVolkswagen had to postpone production because of the epidemic. Production at the plants of the joint venture with Shanghai Automotive (SAIC) should not take place until 24. In February, instead of being resumed this Monday, the Group explained. The reasons are problems in the supply chains and logistics as well as limited travel possibilities for employeeYeah. The other plants operated with manufacturers of First Automotive Works have partly resumed production or are expected to resume production in the coming days, it was said.\nThe chemical industry has so far felt "little impact" on the industry in Germany. In China, however, German chemical companies had already shut down production, according to VCI. Demand in the People\'s Republic had fallen and value chains had been damaged. "With every day that the Corona epidemic continues, the risk of negative consequences for the global economy increases," warned VCI chief executive Wolfgang Grande Entrup. (dpa'
'888888,0,China is assigning a QR code to citizens, which identifies them as part of the green, yellow or red groups, to facilitate control of the new coronavirus (covid-19) in the country and to accelerate its return to normality. It works like some sort of bar code that\'s read through the cell phone camera. The purpose of the Beijing Government is to warn citizens at risk of contracting dens-19 which must be isolated, as well as to monitor their entry into public spaces such as metro stations and shopping malls.\nThe code is generated by the Alipay Health Code application, which was developed by the Alipay team, a popular payment application in the country belonging to the same group as the technological giant Alibaba.\n"The QR codes, produced with the mobile application of Alipay, are based on user movements in the last two weeks and assess whether users have visited areas affected by the virus", reads in the communication shared on the website of the National Health Commission of China. Zhejiang, Sichuan and Hainan provinces were the first to adopt the use of QR Code which is already used in more than 200 Chinese cities.\nThe information is combined with an enquiry into the state of health of citizens. At the end, a color is attributed to users: green (if there is no reason to isolate), yellow (necessary seven days of isolation), or red (14 days of isolation).\nTo enter many public spaces, citizens must show the QR code of the application to "green". According to an article published by the Chinese news agency Xinhua, expressions such as "Are you green today? "have become a code to talk about the outbreak of covid-1Yeah.\nThe result is associated with information that citizens use to register in the application such as name, identity number and mobile phone number, but no further details about the future of such data are revealed after the outbreak of covid-19.\nIt is not the only example of mobile application used to stop the spread of the virus. In addition to virtual lessons for the youngest, thousands of doctors have been available to work for free through the WeDoctor, a Hangzhou startup that facilitates virtual queries. that people in China also have access to another mobile application, accessible through message services such as WeChat, which alerts them when there is "close contact" with someone potentially infected with the new coronavirus.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe use of technology to monitor citizens is already standard in China. For years the country has been developing a social credit system to classify and hierarchize each of its citizens from personal data they deliver to mobile applications and public services. The score can determine access to employment, the price of products, the place on a train, and access to transport.\nRecently, however, the Chinese government has been criticised for using technology to try to stop the initial information about the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the covid-19 disease. The death of the Chinese doctor who detected the initial outbreak, and was arrested in early January for spreading false rumors, triggered strong criticism from the Beijing governmentYeah.\nThe contests gained new breath this week with the publication of an investigation by the University of Toronto\'s Citizen Lab team showing that key words associated with the new coronavirus (e.g. unknown pneumonia in Wuhan) began to be censored in Chinese applications such as YY (live video application) WeChat (equivalent to WhatsApp) in December 2019'
'888888,1,Wuhan\'s pneumonia epidemic ended Thursday in 2019, with the number of infected and dead rapidly increasing, and authorities decided to take tough measures to curb the situation out of control. After announcing the suspension of mass transportation and Airport Flights in Wuhan at 10 a.m. in the early morning of the 23rd, a large number of vehicles caused highway congestion and supermarket shelves were also emptied due to panic.\nAfter the closure of Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou and Chibi announced the suspension of public transport in and outside the city, and Xiantao and Zhijiang also announced the suspension of passenger transport, the Central News Agency reported. In total, there are six cities in Hubei Province. In order to prevent the epidemic of mobile diffusion during the Spring Festival, the public transport service plan was suspended, and the citizens were advised not to go out of the city, and outsiders were not allowed to enter the city. The population affected reached 20 million, which is the largest closure plan in modern times.\nFrench tourists returning to Paris from Wuhan, China, on Thursday on a multiplication flight described the "closure" of Wuhan, AFP reported. Philippe dauger, a French tourist wearing a mask, told AFP that he was shocked by the lax security checks at Charles de Gaulle Airport after arriving in Paris. He described that when they got on the plane, the army had arrived. It was this morning that I learned that Wuhan was closed. "All our French colleagues and friends stay there." "The price of goods in the store has doubled, and there is a shortage of goods," he said. People are asking for information. "\nIt was also reported that the National Health Protection Committee said that some new cases of coronavirus infection had not been to the Southern China seafood market in Wuhan, but did not travel to Wuhan.\nYang Gonghuan, former deputy director of the National Center for Disease Control and prevention, who participated in SARS epidemic prevention in 2003, believes that this means that a second generation of cases has emerged. The number of cases is still increasing, and she expects next month to be the peak of the outbreak. Yang Gonghuan added that although the ability of virus isolation in China is high and the detection facilities are advanced, the core problem is that in the face of infectious diseases, we can\'t hide it, we need to tell the people, let everyone understand, so as to better prevent and control.\n'
'888888,0,CARACAS - On March 13, Melquiades Avila, an indigenous leader and journalist in the remote Venezuelan state of Delta Amacuro, asked on his popular Facebook account: "Will our hospital be ready for coronavirus?"  \n Earlier that week, as Venezuela confirmed its first infections by the novel coronavirus, President Nicolas Maduro\'s health ministry on its website had listed Delta Amacuro\'s Luis Razetti Hospital as one of 46 medical centres "prepared" to receive COVID-19 patients.  \n Avila enumerated various reasons, all confirmed by Reuters in interviews with physicians at the hospital, why the claim was false: The facility has no blood pressure monitors, syringes, or reagents to diagnose coronavirus infections.  \n "What a joke," Avila wrote.  \n A day later, Lizeta Hernandez, governor of Delta Amacuro and a member of the ruling Socialist party, called on local radio for Avila\'s arrest, accusing him of "inciting hatred" and denouncing him as "criminal." She ordered the state Army deployment to detain Avila "so that I can give him a masterclass in the meaning of public duty."  \n In a voice message to Reuters, the governor this week said she only wanted to "orient" Avila and ensure he was being "serious and responsible" as a journalist. She declined to answer questions about the hospital, its readiness or previous clashes with Avila, who for years has criticized health care in the state.  \n Raquel Ruiz, the hospital director, denied the facility is unprepared. State authorities, she added, are readying a nearby building to treat coronavirus patients.  \n The threat against Avila, who is now in hiding but spoke with Reuters by telephone, is one of at least seven recent episodes in which Venezuelan authorities have sought to arrest critics of the government\'s preparedness for the coronavirus, according to interviews with three accused individuals and lawyers of four others.  \n In addition to Avila, police have arrested an opposition lawmaker who tweeted – correctly, according to health workers from the facility – that another hospital on the "prepared" list has no running water. Police also arrested a retired medical technician who in a video said a hospital in Monagas state was unprepared.  \n Officials from Venezuela\'s health, justice and information ministries didn\'t respond to requests for comment about the detentions, conditions at the hospitals or police involvement in the coronavirus response.  \n Even in normal circumstances, dissent can subject citizens to arrest, prison sentences or worse in Venezuela, where aggressive security policies have prompted Western democracies to sanction the government for human rights abuses. Now, government opponents say the coronavirus offers a new opportunity for Maduro to crack down.  \n In China, where the current outbreak began, government efforts to quash early warnings about the virus may have helped it spread, public health experts have said. China denies any such cover-ups happened.  \n Maduro\'s critics fear the same may happen in Venezuela, where poverty, hunger and a shortage of basic medical supplies complicated health care even before the pandemic. "The government is trying to hide the truth," says Humberto Prado, who heads a human rights commission for opposition legislators. "If you talk, they\'ll arrest and silence you."  \n  \n "NARNIA WORLD"  \n As of late Tuesday, Venezuela has confirmed 91 COVID-19 cases and no deaths.  \n More than 20 doctors and public health specialists told Reuters they fear the toll could mount quickly despite a show of force that the government says should contain the outbreak. Some of its measures are not unlike the enforced lockdowns imposed by some U.S. states and Western European nations.  \n But the forces carrying out the tasks in Venezuela have long been associated with corruption and extralegal violence. The National Police\'s feared Special Action Force, accused by citizens and government critics of extrajudicial killings and torture, patrols streets.  \n Intelligence agents now guard sites ranging from supermarkets to the Caracas medical institute tasked with coronavirus testing. At some roadblocks, police and soldiers have shaken down medical workers before letting them get to or from work, according to 12 doctors and nurses interviewed by Reuters.  \n One physician said she paid the equivalent of a week\'s salary at a checkpoint in the central city of Maracay. "The officers weren\'t going to let me pass," she said.  \n Police officials in Maracay didn\'t respond to a request by Reuters to discuss the incident. Regional military leaders, who also staff checkpoints, referred Reuters to the defence ministry in Caracas. Officials at the defence ministry didn\'t return phone calls or emails requesting comment.  \n Some police, acting on tips from neighbourhood informants, are accompanying government medics to poor neighbourhoods and forcing individuals with suspected coughs or other illnesses to get examinations, people familiar with the operations said. The administration this week said security forces had visited over 18,000 homes.  \n Meanwhile, the government is keeping private physicians from conducting diagnoses, senior doctors told Reuters, centralizing all testing at the National Hygiene Institute, a Caracas facility that passes results directly to the health ministry.  \n Earlier this month, the ministry stopped coronavirus testing at Caracas\' private El Avila Clinic, two medical workers familiar with the order said. On March 13, one of these people said, government workers went to the clinic and confiscated testing materials.  \n Vicente Marzullo, the clinic\'s director, didn\'t respond to efforts by Reuters to discuss the government\'s measures there.  \n Avila, the 54-year-old journalist in Delta Amacuro, has angered government officials before. A member of the native Warao tribe, Avila has chronicled growing health challenges for indigenous peoples during Venezuela\'s economic collapse.  \n In 2018, he broadcast on local radio a Warao woman saying relatives were dying because of a lack of medicines. Hernandez, the governor, stormed into his office afterward and accused him of spreading lies, Avila said.  \n Four physicians at the hospital on Maduro\'s coronavirus list told Reuters that Avila\'s warnings are accurate. The doctors, who asked not to be identified, said the hospital has none of the materials Avila mentioned and that, crucially, it has no ventilators, which have been vital in other countries to help COVID-19 patients breathe.  \n "Mr. Avila\'s comments weren\'t lies," one senior doctor said. "The government lives in a Narnia world," alluding to the classic fantasy epics of C.S. Lewis.  \n  \n "A DANGEROUS PERSON"  \n Health-care workers in nine additional states told Reuters that other hospitals on the list are also deficient.  \n The Leopoldo Manrique Terrero Hospital, in the Coche district of Caracas, isn\'t even open to patients. It hasn\'t functioned as a clinical facility for at least three years, two maintenance workers there said. Reuters was unable to identify a director for the hospital or a working telephone number for administrative offices.  \n In northeastern Monagas state, medical personnel have been so concerned about a lack of preparedness for COVID-19 that they filmed a protest outside the Manuel Nunez Tovar Hospital, another facility on the list.  \n Darwin Moreno, the hospital\'s director, in a brief telephone conversation this week said he could discuss the incident later in the day. He didn\'t return follow-up phone calls or messages.  \n In the video, filmed March 13 and seen by Reuters, Julio Molinos, a retired technician and medical union leader, urged the health ministry to be transparent. The video, shared widely through chat groups, reached authorities.  \n On March 15, officers from the Special Action Force, or FAES, arrested Molinos, according to two lawyers defending him. FAES administrators didn\'t respond to a Reuters request for comment on the arrest.  \n Last week, a judge placed Molinos, 72, under house arrest on charges of conspiracy and inciting hatred and panic. Jose Sosa, one of his lawyers, denied the charges and called Molinos a "political prisoner."  \n In the southeastern state of Bolivar, Tony Geara, an opposition lawmaker, in a March 14 Twitter thread wrote that "there isn\'t even water" at the local Ruiz y Paez Hospital. Three workers there told Reuters the facility hasn\'t had running water for the past five years and relies on trucks to deliver it.  \n Reuters was unable to reach hospital directors for comment.  \n Hours after Geara\'s tweets, agents from the SEBIN intelligence agency stopped the lawmaker at a roadblock, according to a report by the agency reviewed by Reuters. He was arrested and remains in police custody.  \n At a court hearing last week, prosecutors charged Geara, 58, with possession of explosives and trafficking weapons. The SEBIN report contains a photo of an agent pointing to an automatic rifle on the road where Geara was arrested. Agents said the rifle was in Geara\'s vehicle, according to the report.  \n SEBIN officials didn\'t respond to a Reuters request for comment. Simon Andarcia, Geara\'s lawyer, said the lawmaker denied the charges and accused agents of planting the weapon.  \n Three colleagues from Geara\'s Popular Will party said SEBIN operatives had been tracking him recently, photographing him at political events. The government, they said, was unhappy with his criticisms and his role helping local charities distribute food and medicine.  \n "The dictatorship believed these things made him a dangerous person," said Luigi Pulcini, a Popular Will state official, who is also Geara\'s cousin. "The tweets were the last straw." REUTERS \n '

Out of these, 36 individuals were foreigners. At present, only two individuals evacuated from Wuhan are still being kept at the facility in Chhawla.\nThe states of Uttarakhand and Gujarat declared Covid-19 a pandemic under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 on Saturday. Similarly, the Maharashtra government issued the Maharashtra COVID-19 Regulations, 2020 and the Himachal Pradesh government issued the Himachal Pradesh COVID-19 Regulations, 2020. First implemented in Karnataka and later in Delhi, these regulations under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 empower certain officials in the district administration to impose restrictions on the movement of citizens and vehicles in order to halt the expansion of the contaminated zone.\nAs on March 14, section 144 of the CrPC has been imposed in Samastipur and Muzaffarpur districts of Bihar apart from Budgam, Shopian, Kishtwark, Ramban, and Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir.

'888888,0,Moscow, 29 January. /tass/ Russian residents don\'t have to worry about getting a new coronavirus from a product from Southeast Asia because it won\'t be imported into Russia. On Wednesday, Vladimir medkin, deputy director of the Agricultural Supervision Bureau of Moscow, Moscow and Tula States, told reporters the news.\nIn China, especially in its southern provinces, the consumption culture of this kind of food has no such record in Russia. There is no threat in veterinary surveillance because the meat of this animal may be the source of the coronavirus, "No imports from Southeast Asian countries to Russia," I said.\nPreviously, it was reported that experts from Wuhan Virus Research Institute concluded that the coronavirus causing viral pneumonia in China was prevalent in Russia, I found that 96% is like a SARS virus carried by bats.

'888888,0,As of Monday, the Federal Ministry of Interior (BMI) has ordered temporary border controls. These will take place at the internal borders with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark.\nGerman nationals, persons with residence status and first domicile in Germany are still allowed to enter Germany. Returning from Italy, Austria and Switzerland are asked to stay at home for 14 days after their return. This applies irrespective of whether or not there is a specific Corona case.\nNew guidelines for border controls are intended to ensure the free movement of goods within the European internal market. The cross-border movement of goods and professional commuters is therefore guaranteed. The latter are asked to provide evidence of their activities. Passengers "without valid travel reason" may no longer enter or leave the abovementioned borders.\nIn individual cases, a personal reason may also be considered "valid". It is up to the border police to decide what private cross-border travel they allow. According to BMI, federal police officers are experienced in assessing such individual cases, as this is their daily business.\nIn addition to Germany and many other countries, the European Union will now close all its external borders. Travels between EU countries and other countries are suspended for 30 days. The measure should apply from Tuesday afternoon.\nAccording to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, there are supposed to be exceptions for citizens with a permanent residence permit for the EU. Also for EU citizens, diplomats, doctors, nurses, researchers and experts. And also for people who transport important goods, as well as commuters who work in the EU.\nFederal and Countries want to drastically reduce tourism in GermanYeah. On Monday, the Federal Government decreed that overnight stays such as hotels or hostels in Germany "can only be used for necessary and explicitly not for tourist purposes" for the time being. In the evening, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a speech, "that there should be no holiday home or abroad".\nThe Robert Koch Institute currently includes the following countries: Areas of risk: Italy, Iran, China: Hubei province, South Korea: Gyeongsangbuk-do province, France: Grand Est region (including Alsace, Lorraine and Champagne-Ardenne), Austria: Tirol federal state, Spain: Madrid, USA: California, Washington and New York.\nThe more important question at the moment is: should I still be travelling? The Federal Government\'s Crisis Lab provides a clear answer by discouraging all non-essential travel abroad. The reason: Because of the measures taken against the Coronavirus, travellers are at increased risk of not being able to return to Germany without further ado. In addition, further drastic restrictions on air and travel are expected in the short term, writes the Foreign Office.\nIn order to slow down the spread of the new virus, many governments have decided to restrict entry worldwide. For example, Poland has closed its borders to foreigners, international air and train connections have been suspended. The United States has banned all entry from Europe for a 30-day period. The entry ban applies to Europeans who have stayed in the Schengen area within a period of 14 days before entering the United States in Germany or another country.\nOther countries, such as Russia or Romania, are committing German immigrants to a 14-day quarantine. Other states, including India, have declared invalid all visas already issued for German nationalYeah. Thailand, on the other hand, does not (yet) have a hard stop.\nYour country\'s entry regulations may also change spontaneously at the moment. It is therefore essential that you inform yourself at short notice, for example at the Foreign Office, at the respective national representation in Germany or at the German Embassy in your country of travel. It is also recommended to keep informed about the current status of booked flights with the airlines.\nThis is not\nuniformly regulated. The contracts of some suppliers include a\nPandemic. In other words, the insurance does not have to pay if a customer is infected with the relevant pathogen during a pandemic. However, some suppliers do not accept this possibility from Kulanz.\nInsurers are currently checking whether their protection continues to apply when customers in\ntravel a country classified by the Robert Koch Institute as a risk area.\nThe validity of some foreign health insurance could therefore still be restricted. Many insurers now publish FAQs with more information on their website.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) has launched a recovery operation for thousands of Germans who are stuck abroad due to travel restrictions in the Corona crisis. Most Germans, approximately 4.000 to 5.000 persons, are located in Morocco according to the Foreign Office. The Federal Army is not currently involved in the repatriation, as there would be enough aircraft available from Lufthansa, for example. These would be used on behalf of the government.\nThe Foreign Office has formally issued a worldwide travel warning for tourist travel.\nAt Deutsche Bahn, tickets can be exchanged for vouchers, even if they are so-called savings prices or super savings prices. A fee is not appropriate. This applies to tickets before the 13th. They were bought in March and the day of the trip between the 13th. March and 30th. April is lyinYeah. The railway has created an online form for this purpose. The application will also be accepted after the day of the trip. Another possibility is to make these tickets flexible up to thirty. Use June on another day. The train\'s been disconnected. Only city tickets are no longer valid.\nThe German market leader Flixbus will cease operations from Wednesday. The company reported this in Munich. All national and cross-border connections to and from Germany are affected. Passengers affected would be informed about bus crashes, they said. You\'d get a voucher for the entire ticket price. The company Blablabus also ceases operations from Wednesday morning.\nLast Monday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared the whole of Italy a restricted zone. Travel within the country is therefore generally prohibited, but exceptions are possible. In the same way as the measures previously imposed on northern Italy, the restrictions should initially be up to three. April applies. Conte explained: "Our habits must change now. We must all give up something for the good of Italy."\nAll shops have been closed since Thursday except supermarkets and pharmacies. This includes bars and restaurants as well as theatres and museums.\nThe Federal Government advises against all unnecessary trips to Italy after the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) had classified the whole country as a risk area. The Foreign Office has since updated its travel instructions. Previously, the indications only applied to regions particularly affected in the north of the country.\nThe Foreign Office points out that it is still possible to return to a place of residence both inside and outside Italy. Checks and requests by security and law enforcement should, however, be expected. A self-declaration on the necessity of a journey within the country would have to be completed and carrieYeah.\nUnfortunately, there is currently no flat-rate answer for all travellers. Contact your tour operator as soon as possible. There you will get information about what you can do if you have booked holidays in countries with travel restrictions. Usually cancellation is free of charge if a travel warning from the Foreign Office is available. As far as the new Coronavirus is concerned, such a warning only applies to the Chinese province of Hubei.\nYou can often cancel your booking even if you have to expect significant changes to your planned trip, writes the Consumer Centre. This applies not only to entry bans, but doubtless even when essential sights cannot be visited. Individual travellers are best able to contact the airlines, railway or bus companies directly and the accommodation already booked or the booking portal used.\n"If there is a specific danger due to exceptional circumstances, you can cancel for free," says the Hamburg lawyer Oliver Matzek, specialist in travel law. Weather or strikes, as well as medical emergencies such as an epidemic, are recognised as exceptional circumstances. In order to find out whether such an exceptional circumstance as a cancellation circumstance is appropriate for your destination, it is best to ask your contractor directly.\nAnyone wishing to cancel an already booked trip for fear of infection, without any specific travel restrictions, can always invoke the cancellation rules agreed upon at the conclusion of the contract, regardless of the Coronavirus.\nIf you do not cancel your trip yourself but, for example, the airline cancels your connection, your ticket price is usually refunded in full. The same applies if a whole package tour is cancelleYeah.\nMost travel cancellation insurance covers only the pre-departure illness, not the risk of possible infection during the journey. You can find the exact terms and conditions of your insurance policy. In principle, you can take out insurance at any time before the first day of your trip, but with a decisive limitation: "At the time of conclusion of the contract, the insurance case may not have occurred yet," explains lawyer Matzek. Thus, existing risks cannot be insured. This also applies to the Corona epidemic, which is particularly important if you are travelling in regions that have already been classified as a risk area.\nReturning from Italy, Austria and Switzerland are asked to stay at home for 14 days after their return. This applies irrespective of whether or not there is a specific Corona case.\nAnyone who develops symptoms typical of the new Coronavirus within a 14-day period after returning from a risk area should call the emergency medical service, which can be reached nationally under 116117. Typical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, but the disease caused by the Coronavirus Covid-19 can vary greatly according to RKI. If you suspect that you are infected, stay at home and do not visit a doctor\'s office or an emergency room on your own, thereby risking infecting your fellow human beings in doubt.\nAs there are no serious predictions as to how the Coronavirus epidemic is developing, this question is not easy to answer at the moment. Many tour operators pause their program until (first) the end of April and relax their cancellation rules. Read more about the question: How safe is the summer holiday 2020'

'888888,0,The death of the Chinese doctor who detected and attempted to report the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan City, which was arrested in early January for spreading false rumours, is inflaming the criticism that was already being heard against the Beijing government.\nThe video in which ophthalmologist Li Wenliang revealed that a mysterious illness was killing people in Wuhan and being suppressed by the authorities, continues to circulate on Chinese social networks and is accompanied by harsh criticism of the central government.\n"Light a candle and pay tribute to a hero," said an internee on the Weibo social network. "You were the ray of light in the night."\nLi Wenliang contracted coronavirus infection by operating on a patient with glaucoma- died of the disease on Thursday. But even in the hospital bed he continued to fight against the Chinese Government. He gave interviews by text, made available a selfie of himself hooked up to breathing machines, helped journalists draw a picture of a public health crisis and told how he had been forced to shut up.\nFor a short time after his death, there were active Weibo- who has 1500 million "topical" users such a s "the Wuhan government owes an apology to doctor Li Wenliang" and "we want freedom of expression", linking the censorship of the Chinese regime to the initial flaws in the response to the outbreak.\nAccording to Reuters, the Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection, which punishes corruption in the Public Administration, announced that it will send investigators to Wuhan to verify "issues raised by the people in relation to Dr. Li Wenliang", without going into further detail.\nIn the face of the criticism, President Jinping justified this Friday that China is doing everything possible to halt the progression of the disease and defeat the coronavirus, which has already killed 638 people and infected more than 31 thousand worldwideYeah.\nXi spoke on the phone with US head of state, Donald Trump, to whom he strengthened this guarantee, while asking for a "more reasonable" reaction from the United States to the outbreak of this infectious disease.\n"We have adopted the most comprehensive and rigorous measures of prevention and control. We have declared a people\'s war against the epidemic,"assures Xi Jinping, according to Chinese television CCTV. "We are totally confident that we are capable of fighting the epidemic. The long-term trend of economic development in China will not change,"the Chinese President said.\nThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had complained that the US and other countries are closing borders on travellers from China, when the World Health Organisation does not advocate travel restrictions. Or for closing down the American consulate in Wuhan, the city where the first infections were detected. The way Washington described the phone call between Xi and Trump, however, focused more on the recent diplomatic and economic successes of the two major powers than on the fight against the coronavirus.\n"The two leaders agree to continue comprehensive communication and cooperation between the two parties. They also highlighted the great achievement of the recent first phase of the US-China trade agreement and reaffirmed the commitment to its implementation,"stated on Twitter the White House spokesman, Judd Deere.\nChina and the US have highlighted that they are investing large resources in the fight against the new virus, but, says the Washington Post, miscommunication between the two countries has been noted, caused by a lack of information sharing and mutual trust at a time of increasing global competition and trade war.\nThe new coronavirus was seen by Beijing as a risk to the regime and public health and, after initial delay in its response, the government pressed ahead with everything it had against the virusYeah. It has quarantined cities in central China (many millions of people), built up two hospitals in a few days, deployed military doctors to the city of Wuhan and deployed hundreds of drones to spread disinfectant in this city.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe propaganda calling for citizens to mobilise against the disease was not neglected. There are television announcements praising the collective effort and the union of the people against this disease.\nAccording to the American newspaper Washington Post, delay in responding to the disease may lead Central Authorities to hold Wuhan authorities accountable. Beijing, under accusations of not being transparent about the size of the outbreak, has already admitted that it needs "to improve the national emergency management system".\nThe US Standard Financial rating agency Poor\'s revealed a forecast of Chinese economy growth for this year reduced by 0,75 percentage points due to coronavirus effects, anticipating that these temporary effects in China will spread worldwide. S&P pointed out, however, that it had a higher degree of uncertainty than usual, because it could not be predicted the severity of the outbreak'

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — Having booked a 13-day road trip across South Korea for April at the start of December last year, Mr Ng Cher Pheng and his family were still raring to go up until recently, even though Covid-19 cases were on the rise in China. \n It was only when cases of the viral infection\xa0in South Korea began to spike dramatically that the 65-year-old retiree, along with his wife and daughter, decided to cancel their trip. \n The problem he now faces? Securing a refund for his Korean Air flight tickets, having paid S$2,200 for three return tickets to Seoul. He had called and emailed the airline last\xa0Wednesday (Feb 27) to inquire about the possibility of a refund, but has not yet received any replies. \n “The airlines should see the situation. We are flying to their country and it\'s not so safe,” Mr Ng told TODAY last\xa0Friday. “They should pay us back… even if it’s just 50 per cent… but if it’s been two weeks\xa0and they haven\'t got\xa0back to us, what can we do?” \n Korean Air’s website does not make it clear whether Mr Ng and his family would be entitled to a refund. \n In a reply to queries from TODAY, a spokesperson said the airline has\xa0taken note of\xa0Mr Ng\'s case. \n "The average number of inquiries at our reservation call center have increased dramatically due to the Covid-19 issue," she said. "Please be assured we are doing\xa0our best to reduce the waiting time for our customers, as well as handling inquiries in order of receipt. We are also updating the latest change/refund guidelines on our website as quickly as possible." \n The airline will continue to monitor the situation and adjust its policies\xa0accordingly to ensure the safety and health of passengers and to minimise customers\' inconvenience,\xa0she added.\xa0 \n Reported cases of Covid-19 in South Korea have shot up from a mere 31 cases on Feb 18 to 4,212 as of March 2. \n Some airlines flying between Singapore and China or South Korea have offered their customers full refunds for cancelled flights, and for those customers from countries with travel restrictions whose plans have been affected. \n But many customers are still not able to get their hands on these refunds, given the high volume of calls the airlines have been getting in recent weeks amid the Covid-19 outbreak that has been spreading worldwide. \n PUT ON HOLD FOR THREE HOURS \n A customer of budget carrier Scoot, who wants to be known only as Benedict, said that his flight from Tianjin, China to Singapore at the start of February was cancelled abruptly, and he had to make hasty arrangements to return home, which involved booking several transfer flights that amounted to S$1,600. \n The 29-year-old who works in the finance industry said that he tried calling Scoot to ask for a refund on the S$400 return fare, but had to call about 10 times — being put on hold for as long as three hours on one attempt — from Feb 2 to Feb 26 before he finally got confirmation that the refund would be sent to his bank in five days. \n However, not all customers caught up in the\xa0outbreak have been able to secure refunds\xa0and they have had to settle for date changes instead. \n Mr Jack Wee, a student at a tertiary education\xa0institute, said that he had booked a flight with Scoot to Seoul on March 7 with his girlfriend and wanted to cancel the holiday\xa0due to the outbreak there, but managed to contact the customer service hotline only two weeks after he began calling on Feb 17. \n “I tried to call three times a day\xa0and waited up to 30 minutes per call,” the 23-year-old said. \n It was only last\xa0Friday morning that he managed to get through to Scoot, which\xa0told him that he could not cancel his booking, but could only\xa0reschedule it to a later date. Though the fee to make the change was waived, Mr Wee still had to pay the fare difference of more than S$400 for both tickets, on top of the S$600 he already paid for them. \n “It kind of made me feel trapped —\xa0either I spend another S$400 or I just go ahead (with the trip) and pray that I don’t catch the virus.” \n Replying to queries from TODAY, Scoot said that it “sincerely apologises for the inconvenience caused, and would like to assure passengers that all committed refunds will be processed within 30 business days”. \n It added that there has been a delay in the process of refunding due to the “high volume of bookings that need to be refunded, beyond the initial batch of mainland China flights that were cancelled”. \n Instead of calling its phone line, Scoot urged customers to reach out to the company via Facebook messenger or through its online feedback form. \n Its website stated that\xa0customers\xa0travelling from Feb 25 to April 30 on flights to or from South Korea — excluding those\xa0whose flights originate from Taiwan — can either re-route to another destination, rebook the flight, or refund the value of the flight via a Scoot travel voucher. \n Among other measures, Scoot has also been providing refunds for ticket holders to mainland China routes where operations have been suspended since Feb 8. \n OTHER AIRLINES AND THEIR POLICIES \n Scoot is not the only airline company with frustrated customers. \n The Facebook pages of other Singapore-based airlines such as Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Jetstar, as well as international airlines that fly into Singapore, have been inundated with comments from their customers, with many confused about refund policies\xa0or frustrated that the firms have been unresponsive. \n Like Mr Wee, some of these Facebook users\xa0claimed that they had spent days trying to contact the airlines\xa0to no avail. \n In response to queries from TODAY, SIA\xa0said that it is “closely monitoring the evolving situation”, and that customers should check its website for the latest waiver policy. \n As of Monday, SIA said\xa0on its website that for those travelling to South Korea, it would waive all change fees for customers with travel dates between Feb 25 and April 30, for tickets issued on or before Feb 25. For those with travel plans to mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, customers may\xa0have their cancellation and change fees waived for travel dates from Jan 24 to April 30, for tickets issued on or before Feb 8. \n At Jetstar, its website states that customers travelling to mainland China, as well as Hong Kong, may\xa0request a full refund or waiver of change fee should their flight have been cancelled or rescheduled. \n Both SIA and Jetstar\xa0acknowledged on their websites that their respective customer service hotlines were facing a high volume of calls\xa0and sought the understanding of their customers for the delays. \n Chinese airline companies China Eastern Airlines and Air China have also announced on their Facebook pages that within certain departure dates, they would be refunding customers who face travel restrictions into China. \n MANY MARKETS AFFECTED \n Analysts interviewed by\xa0TODAY said that the airline industry is struggling to cope with the sudden flood of cancellations because this is a “once in many years situation”. \n Aviation analyst Brendan Sobie of Sobie Aviation said that airline companies will find it “hard to plan for this kind of scenario, because they are trying to cut costs and capacity, but at the same time they don’t know how long (the outbreak) would last”. \n While there are incidents such as\xa0volcano eruptions that affect\xa0individual markets, the worldwide effect of the outbreak makes this situation especially difficult for airline companies due to the many markets involved, he added. \n “Customers want a faster response, but companies cannot (hire) staff (to handle customer service) just for this once-in-many-years situation.”\xa0 \n CORRECTION:\xa0In an earlier version of this report, we got aviation analyst Brendan Sobie\'s designation wrong. It has been amended. We are sorry for the error \n '
'888888,0,(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\nBy Peter Apps\nLONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - As the coronavirus outbreak turns global, stock markets and world populations are waking up to the threat of a global pandemic. That, though, hasn’t been the only disturbing global news this week. In the Middle East and Asia in particular, military tensions are on the rise – and major countries seem ever less bothered about taking off the gloves.\nMost worrying, arguably, were events over the last 24 hours in Syria. As that civil war enters its final throes, Russia and Turkey have been increasingly at loggerheads. The killing of 33 Turkish soldiers in an apparent Syrian government air strike on Thursday took that confrontation into untested territory, with Ankara now furious at not just Moscow and Damascus but also Western nations it believes have abandoned it.\nOn Friday, Turkey said it would no longer stop Syrian refugees from making their way to Europe, threatening a return of the mass population moves last seen in 2015-16. Then, the arrival of hundreds of thousands in Europe fuelled considerable popular discontent, powering the rise of right-wing parties. That comes against a backdrop of further confrontation between Syria and Israel, with Israeli helicopters reportedly injuring several Syrian personnel in attacks along the border.\nTensions and violence between Iran and its regional enemies in the Gulf are also arguably at an all-time high, even if the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani does appear to have deterred direct regional escalation. In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops have been on the offensive again around the town of Luhansk. And in the South China Sea, this week saw Chinese forces target a U.S. plane with what was described as a military laser, prompting angry complaints from Washington.\nDrawing a direct line between these confrontations and the virus outbreak is almost certainly a step too far, although the Chinese government in particular might welcome a distraction from the outbreak. So might Iran, already home to one of the largest outbreaks outside Asia, and where popular discontent with the government has also been on the rise. What is more unarguably the case, however, is that the resources governments will need to plough into tackling the disease will likely prove a potent distraction from events elsewhere.\nWhat that will mean will be different in different places – and the long-term legacy may be distinctly different from the short-term consequences. In Hong Kong, worries over the virus seem to have dramatically reduced protests against the government in Beijing. But they have also dramatically intensified anger and frustration with the mainland, which many Hong Kong residents see as mishandling the disease and exporting it to the city.\nIf, as seems increasingly likely, the virus outbreak dramatically dents global economic growth, perhaps even producing a recession, that will likely raise the political temperature almost everywhere.\nMuch, of course, will depend on how serious the outbreak proves. Particularly deadly outbreaks of disease have traditionally limited wars, at least their duration, decimating armies and leaving populations too weak to stomach serious conflict. Already, an outbreak in South Korea has prompted the United States to cancel planned military drills.\nWhether coronavirus is truly enough to force nations towards an even temporary peace, however, may well be in doubt. What does look increasingly probable, is that it will affect millions and perhaps kill hundreds of thousands in multiple countries around the world.\nGeopolitical confrontation invariably makes tackling such outbreaks harder, and the effect of conflict – and particularly mass population moves – can help their spread. Most notable would be the Spanish flu outbreak that swept the world following World War One. The death toll of that outbreak – believed to have affected up to a quarter of the global population - is estimated at between 40-100 million.\nIf coronavirus does go global, it is still not impossible that will drive countries together rather than apart. At worst, though, it may simply further undermine the already deteriorating trust millions of people around the world have in their leaders and institutions to protect them. That’s a recipe for further global instability, just as the world can afford it least. *** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues.

'888888,0,China postpones the annual session of the National People\'s Congress due to the Coronavirus epidemic. This was reported by the state broadcaster CCTV. A new date will be set by the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party at a later date. The ten-day meeting was actually on 5th. In March. Around 6.000 delegates from all over the country should have participated.\nLast week, the Standing Committee of the People\'s Congress had already spoken in favour of a postponement of the date. According to CCTV, the People\'s Congress is being postponed for the first time since the Cultural Revolution. Since 35 years he has always met in March. The postponement was also motivated by the fact that many of the MEPs were "on the front line" fighting the epidemic.\nChina has recently seen a sharp increase in the numbers of corona virus infected. More than 77.000 people have contracted lung disease. 2.592 people had died as a result of the virus. It is believed that the pathogen has passed from a wild animal to humans in a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The Standing Committee of the Politburo therefore also advised at its meeting this Monday to ban the trade in wild animals, as the official news agency Xinhua reported.\nWuhan has been sealed off from the outside world for a month. However, many foreign citizens have been brought back to their home countries from there. For the first time, experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) are now also in Wuhan. They visit two hospitals and meet the head of the Chinese Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, as well as other persons responsible for the disease protection of the province of Hubei.\nAt the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organization WHO a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause from WuhaYeah. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).\nSars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 are the same pathogens that infect bats. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, and every third party has died from it.\nOverall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.\nMedical practitioners assume that the virus is transmitted from person to person mainly by drip infection.\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nMore than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers suspect roughly somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all casesYeah. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.\nFollow the progress of registered cases in Germany on this map.\nThe number of infected worldwide tested positive for Corona shows this map from Johns Hopkins University.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO is treating the disease as a pandemic. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.\nTypical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinations. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccination.\nIn Italy, the country most affected by the virus in Europe, the fifth Covid-19 death has since been reported. More than 200 infected have been registered so far. The Italian authorities had taken draconian measures to contain the virus at the weekend. Eleven communities in the north of the country have been sealed off, 52.000 people are practically quarantined. The carnival in Venice ended prematurely.\nThe EU Commission welcomed Italy\'s steps to contain the Coronavirus. The Italian government had acted quickly and "effective structures to respond in a well-coordinated manner to this outbreak", said EU Commissioner responsible for crisis coordination Janez LenarciYeah. He announced the release of 232 million euros to strengthen the global fight against the virus.\nPossible border controls in the Schengen area lie within the competence and decision of the individual Member States, said Lenarcic. However, he urged governments to take all decisions to combat the virus on the basis of a "credible risk assessment" and to act in a proportionate and coordinated manner.\nAccording to EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides, the Italian Government has agreed to a mission of WHO experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). This is due to arrive in Italy on Tuesday." We must take this situation seriously,"said Kyriakides. However, EU citizens should\'do not panic\'and fall into misinformation about the disease.\nIn Iran, in the city of Ghom, at least fifty people died of Covid-19 last month. For example, the British Intelligence Agency The Guardian quoted the semi-state Iranian news agency ILNA. Therefore, in Ghom, south of the capital Tehran, 250 people are under quarantine. A city official, Ahmad Amiribadi Farahani, said the numbers went back to the 13th. February. However, Iran did not have until 19th. February reports infected and dead by the Coronavirus. Health Minister Saeid Namaki had first confirmed 12 deaths.\nThe first case of a disease has also been confirmed in neighbouring Afghanistan. Health Minister Firusuddin Firus said at a televised press conference that the case had occurred in the province of Herat, which borders Iran. Firus urged not to travel to Herat or from Herat to other parts of the country. Afghanistan has temporarily closed its border with Iran.\nCases of Covid-19 infection have also been confirmed in Bahrain and KuwaitYeah. The Ministry of Health in Kuwait announced that three people who had returned from the Iranian city of Maschhad to Kuwait had been shown to have the virus. The Bahrain case was also a person who came from Iran to the country, BNA reported.\nTurkey had already closed its border crossings with Iran on Sunday to prevent the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 Coronavirus. Moreover, from 20-hour local time (18-hour MEZ) flights from Iran are no longer expected to land in Turkey, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. This was "temporary".

'888888,0,A Viruses are microscopic biological parasites that lack the ability to survive and reproduce outside living organisms, which include animals, humans and even bacteria. \n They become active only when they come into contact with living cells, which they then try to hijack to produce more viruses. \n A They belong to a large group of viruses that usually infect only animals, and are so named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. \n Scientists have identified coronaviruses that affect humans, with seven types of these viruses classified to date. \n Four of these typically cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses such as the common cold. But the remaining three have more severe repercussions on human health. \n The first is the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus, which killed almost 800 people in 32 countries 17 years ago. \n The other two are Mers-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread farther, and 2019-nCov (Wuhan virus), which killed its first victims in the Chinese city of Wuhan. \n A Scientists speculate that the Wuhan virus, like the Mers and Sars viruses, evolved from coronavirus strains that previously affected only animals. \n Coronaviruses generally have a single strand of genetic material called RNA, which is more easily copied or mutated than humans\' double-stranded DNA, and this accounts for their virality. \n The Wuhan virus has been closely linked to Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, which reportedly also peddled live animals like deer and animal parts, in addition to seafood. \n Scientists said that such unnatural situations, where animals are brought together and often housed in poor conditions in close proximity to people, create opportunities for a virus to hop between animals. The virus could then have mutated so that it is able to infect humans, and eventually start spreading among people. \n Every virus typically infects a certain type of living host organism, said Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, deputy executive director of research at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research\'s (A*Star) Bioinformatics Institute. "Viruses can shift their host preference through mutations... Some viruses mutate much faster." \n A The Wuhan coronavirus is understood to spread much like the common flu does - through the air when an infected person coughs, through close contact such as shaking hands with an infected person, or touching an object which has the virus on it before touching one\'s mouth and eyes. \n For now, virologists say the Wuhan coronavirus is likely not as infectious as the Sars virus. But there are concerns that the Wuhan virus\' current reported 2 per cent death rate - where two out of 100 infected people die - is not representative, and that the virus could further mutate to become more lethal. \n There are worries that the number of infections is under-reported, with many brushing off symptoms as those of the common flu. \n A It is a different strain and, for now, has reported a lower fatality rate than the Sars virus. \n The World Health Organisation estimates the overall fatality rate for Sars patients to be between 14 per cent and 15 per cent, while that for Wuhan is currently at 2 per cent. \n Researchers have said that the Wuhan virus shares only 76 per cent of its genetic material with the Sars virus - a big difference in genetic terms, much like "comparing a dog and a cat". \n There is, however, speculation that both viruses originated from bats. Recent reports have also suggested that the Wuhan virus might be linked to snakes too. \n A No, said Professor Paul Tambyah of the Department of Medicine at the National University of Singapore\'s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. \n Instead, we should be concerned. \n He said there are measures in place to control the outbreak here and elsewhere. The public should be concerned and thus be vigilant about maintaining good hand hygiene, seeking medical attention if unwell and staying home, he said. \n A Wear a surgical mask when you have a cold or flu. \n Some doctors have been wearing surgical masks as a precautionary measure at work, so some people have wondered if they should dig out their N95 masks too. \n But there is no need to, said Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Instead, they should wear surgical ones. \n "N95 masks are... very difficult to breathe in. If you find the N95 mask easy to breathe in and comfortable, you are wearing it wrongly and it is no use," she said, adding that these masks are not recommended for the public. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said everyone with respiratory symptoms must wear masks, now that there is human-to-human transmission for the Wuhan virus. \n A The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday said Singaporeans should avoid travelling to Wuhan, stepping up a notch from its advice on Wednesday for people to\xa0defer non-essential travel there. \n The ministry said it updated the travel advisory "in view of the\xa0developing novel coronavirus\xa0situation in Wuhan and other parts of China", with confirmed cases spreading beyond Wuhan to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong, which abuts densely populated Hong Kong. \n It also cited the travel halt imposed by the Chinese authorities on Thursday, as all flights out of the city were cancelled and trains, buses and ferries suspended. \n The ministry\xa0also reminded the public to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n MOH said all travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history. \n If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose, they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit. \n A Singapore is stepping up precautionary measures in anticipation of more travellers in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The expanded measures include temperature screening for all travellers arriving from China - not just Wuhan alone - at Changi Airport from yesterday, and issuing health advisory notices to them. \n A A flu vaccine will not help protect you against the Wuhan coronavirus. There is no vaccine to protect against coronaviruses. \n However, according to an advisory from Raffles Medical, you should still get a flu jab if you are travelling to places where there are suspected cases to prevent you from contracting influenza symptoms that may mislead the screening authorities at temperature checkpoints. \n There is also no specific treatment to cure illnesses caused by human coronaviruses, including pneumonia caused by the Wuhan virus. \n Patients typically recover on their own after some time. \n '
'888888,0,The death toll in China\'s coronavirus outbreak rose to 811 on Sunday, surpassing the number of fatalities in the 2002-03 SARS epidemic, while over 37,000 people have been confirmed as being infected with the deadly virus that has spread to more than 25 countries.\n\nEighty-nine deaths were reported on Saturday -- the highest single-day death toll -- and there were 2,656 new confirmed cases of the deadly infection, China\'s National Health Commission said in its daily report on Sunday.\nA total of 811 people have died of the disease so far and 37,198 confirmed cases have been reported in 31 provincial-level regions in China, according to the commission.\nThe death toll surpassed the number of fatalities in the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS epidemic that started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in the mainland, Hong Kong and elsewhere.\nAmong the 89 deaths, 81 were from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, two in Henan, and one each in Hebei, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Shandong, Hunan and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, it said.\nOn Saturday, 600 people, including 324 in Hubei province, recovered and walked out of the hospitals, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\nAs per the data released by the commission, confirmed cases in Hubei, the ground zero of the epidemic, showed a drop perhaps for the first time since the virulent virus first emerged in the province in December.\nOn Saturday, Hubei reported 2,147 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection, the commission said.\nThe figure is 694 less compared with the new confirmed cases reported in the previous day, it said.\nHubei\'s capital Wuhan reported 1,379 new infections and 63 new deaths, and the cities of Xiaogan and Huanggang reported 123 and 100 new confirmed cases, respectively, according to the provincial health commission\n.\nHubei alone reported 27,100 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection, with 780 deaths and 5,247 cases in severe or critical condition.\nAlso, 1,439 patients have been discharged after recovery from the hospital, it said.\nAcross China, 6,188 patients remained in severe condition and 28,942 people were suspected of being infected with the virus, it said.\nA total of 2,649 people had been discharged from hospital after recovery.\nBy the end of Saturday, 26 confirmed cases and one death had been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 17 in Taiwan.\nOne patient in Macao and one in Taiwan were discharged from hospital after recovery, it said.\nOn Saturday, an American woman and a Japanese man became the first foreigners to have died from the new coronavirus in China.\nThe 60-year old American citizen died in Wuhan, the US embassy here said, the first confirmed foreign death from the outbreak in China.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry last week said that 19 foreign nationals in China have been confirmed to have contracted the virus and undergoing treatment in hospitals.\nTwo of them were discharged after recovery, the ministry said, without disclosing details. Earlier reports said that four Pakistanis and two Australians contracted the virus.\nA Japanese man hospitalised in Wuhan with pneumonia has also died, Japan\'s foreign ministry announced in Tokyo.\nMeanwhile, the head of the World Health Organisation said on Saturday that the UN health agency will send an international mission to China as it received a response from Beijing.\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the team leader will leave early next week with the rest of the experts to follow.\nThe UN health agency said the number of cases of the coronavirus in China is "stabilising", which is a "good news".\nIt, however, cautioned that it was too early to make any predictions about whether the virus might have peaked\n.\n"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei," Michael Ryan, head of WHO\'s Health Emergencies Programme said at a briefing in Geneva.\n"We\'re in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn\'t advanced. That\'s good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place," Ryan was quoted as saying.\nBut he added that it was "very early to make any predictions".\nGhebreyesus said the trend was "not really accelerating" but advised "caution".\n'

'888888,0,NEW YORK - A New Jersey man has been charged with making terroristic threats after he was accused of coughing on a supermarket employee and saying he was infected with the coronavirus behind the ongoing pandemic, authorities said Tuesday.  \n George Falcone, 50, was issued a summons for terroristic threats in the third degree and other charges over the incident, according to the office of New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal.  \n In a Facebook message to Reuters on Tuesday, Falcone denied the accusations, saying, "Didn\'t cough on anyone and never mentioned corona."  \n According to Grewal, Falcone was in a Wegman\'s supermarket in Manalapan, New Jersey on Sunday evening when an employee asked him to step back from prepared foods while she covered them. Instead, prosecutors said, he leaned toward her and purposely coughed, laughing and saying he was infected with the coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as COVID-19 that can be severe or fatal.  \n Falcone went on to tell two other employees that they were lucky to have jobs, and initially refused to identify himself when approached by a police officer.  \n New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy referred to the charges in a news conference on Tuesday, saying there were "knuckleheads out there" and that law enforcement was taking action against "egregious" behaviour as the state locks down in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.  \n Nationwide, the coronavirus, which broke out late last year in Wuhan, China, has infected nearly 50,000 people and killed 640, with more than a quarter of the deaths in New York state.

'888888,0,The World Health Organisation (WHO) is not quick to declare global public health emergencies. \n From 2007 through 2019, the United Nations agency did so on only five occasions. The rapidly spreading new coronavirus that originated in December in China\'s Wuhan makes a sixth. \n The fallout from the organisation\'s Jan 30 call has spread rapidly. Four days later, the total number of countries placing border restrictions on Chinese travellers has surged to 60. They include Australia, India, Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, Russia and North Korea, and many countries have evacuated or are attempting to evacuate their citizens from Hubei province at the epidemic\'s epicentre. \n "Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems" than China\'s, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet. "I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern… not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries." \n The new coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, can lead to severe and often deadly pneumonia. Even as the number of infections and deaths rapidly mounted in Hubei\'s capital Wuhan and cases appeared in a growing number of other countries, the WHO took a deliberate approach to evaluating the danger. \n The agency\'s emergency committee, in meetings on Jan 22-23, initially decided not to designate it a global crisis pending collection of more data. A week later, the WHO declared the coronavirus the first global public health emergency originating in China. Such a designation did not apply to even the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic 17 years ago. \n A look at how the organisation reached its decision shows some of the inner workings of the global system for preventing and managing the spread of dangerous new diseases\n. \n The system relies on the rapid sharing of information among national health systems and the global public health organisation. Although some Chinese officials have drawn criticism internally and abroad for initially trying to downplay the crisis, the WHO\'s Dr Tedros maintains China was quick to share information, enhancing the global response. \n "In many ways, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response," Dr Tedros said at a press conference. "We would have seen many more cases outside China by now, and probably deaths, if not for the government\'s efforts." \n Data from China on the pathogen allowed Japan, South Korea and Thailand to diagnose similar cases quickly, he said. For example, a Chinese laboratory warned the German government of an infected person returning to Germany. \n Dr Tedros, an Ethiopian public health expert, arrived on Jan 27 in Beijing to meet Chinese officials. During his visit, President Xi Jinping called on the country to be transparent in working with the rest of the world and agreed to allow the WHO to send a group of international experts into the country to study the new strain of coronavirus alongside Chinese counterparts. \n Those data-gathering steps helped fill the information gap that kept the WHO\'s emergency panel from issuing its global warning sooner. \n Before the Jan 22-23 meetings, the lack of information on the virulence, infectiousness, severity and clinical symptoms of the coronavirus made reaching a consensus difficult, WHO emergency committee member John Mackenzie told media company Caixin. \n The global organisation had evidence of transmission of the virus within a household, but that is not unusual for a respiratory disease. The experts were looking for "third-or fourth-generation infections", referring to how many times a disease has been passed on, an indication of virulence. That evidence came quickly, laying the groundwork for the emergency committee to issue its global warning\n. \n Some argue that compared with the 2003 Sars crisis, the Chinese government has been much more transparent about the current coronavirus. \n "Before we start pointing the finger at China, we need to recognise there are genuine sensitivities around sharing data around new diseases," said Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO\'s health emergencies programme who accompanied Dr Tedros to Beijing. "I believe in this case the countries that have been affected, including China, have been remarkably transparent." \n According to US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, China\'s compliance with international health regulations and uploading of the genetic sequence of the virus enabled the Americans to develop a test kit to screen for infections. \n Under the WHO-administered International Health Regulations, a global public health emergency applies to "an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response". \n Since 2007, the WHO has declared public health emergencies in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2014 setbacks in global polio eradication efforts, the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, the 2016 Zika virus outbreak and the 2018-2019 Kivu Ebola epidemic. \n The organisation\'s emergency committee, which makes the call, is made up of epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease experts. Among them, at least one expert comes from the country where the epidemic began. \n The panel can also make recommendations to foreign governments on measures such as travel or trade restrictions. \n Even during serious crises, the WHO is conservative in its pronouncements. Through July last year, the Kivu Ebola epidemic killed 1,500 and infected more than 2,300 after appearing in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2018 and spread to nearby countries\n. The disease was not declared an international public health emergency until the WHO\'s fourth emergency committee meeting last July. \n Three factors weighed on the current WHO decision, according to Professor Didier Houssin, chairman of the WHO emergency committee. They were the rising number of cases in China, the growing number of countries with confirmed infections and the spread of questionable measures by some nations involving travellers. \n While the emergency committee does not encourage travel or trade restrictions, it acknowledges that such steps can be useful at times, such as when response capabilities are limited or when there is a large likelihood of infection among vulnerable groups. \n Under the International Health Regulations, countries are required to report travel restrictions to the WHO, and they are barred from taking steps that encourage discrimination. \n After news broke of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, many countries imposed increasingly stringent measures. In addition to posting travel warnings and tightening border controls, several counties implemented preliminary screening measures using their own public health organisations to diagnose those who may have come into contact with the virus even before they showed symptoms. \n The United States reacted especially quickly. On Jan 17, four days after Thailand reported its first case, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it would screen passengers arriving from Wuhan at major airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. At the time, the US had not reported any cases of the disease. After it did so, the country expanded screenings of Chinese passengers to 20 airports while also advising against all travel to China\n. \n Last Friday, the US declared the coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency and temporarily closed its borders to foreign nationals who had travelled to China in the previous two weeks and are not immediate family members of US citizens or permanent residents. The government also imposed mandatory two-week quarantines for those who were in China\'s Hubei province during that time span. \n As she confirmed Europe\'s first case of the coronavirus on Jan 24, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn promised total transparency and daily updates to combat misinformation. She said sharing epidemic information with the public was the best barrier to its spread. \n Even though China shared the virus\' genome sequence on Jan 11, researchers do not yet have a full grasp of its characteristics and routes of transmission, according to the WHO. \n Because developing a vaccine or treatment requires significant time and resources, all countries - including China and the US - should pool their efforts, said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), an international epidemiology group. \n Cepi, made up of public and private entities, said on Jan 23 that it was funding research into three separate efforts to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus with the aim of shortening development time to several months. \n The US National Institutes of Health started research on vaccines after receiving the virus\' genetic sequencing, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Jan 20. He cautioned that the development process can last months or years, so controlling the epidemic will require "traditional" public health measures. \n So long as there is no vaccine, the only available measures for slowing the spread of the disease are quarantine, delaying resumption of work and schools and restricting travel, Dr Hatchett said last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland\n. He cautioned that the cost of these measures is high and difficult to sustain. \n From studying non-medical interventions in the 1980s, the US found that disease prevention is more effective when a city implements various interventions during the onset of an outbreak, Dr Hatchett said. \n As a US government public health official in 2005, Dr Hatchet helped draft the country\'s epidemic response plan in the light of the outbreak of the H5N1 influenza. \n • Xu Heqian, Wu Hongyuran, Qu Yunxu, Fu Lin, Zhang Qi, Chen Lixiong and Li Xin contributed to this article. \n • This article was first published by Caixin Global.\n'

Some cause the common cold while others originating in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses such as SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome or MERS Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nShortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

'888888,0,\nHaving pumped more than 12 billion dollars over nearly a decade into preparing for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Japan\'s dream is at risk from the coronavirus - and one man may have the final say.\nThomas Bach, the 66-year-old former Olympic fencing champion and president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), has virtually complete control over the body and by far the biggest influence on whether the Games will go ahead or not.\nWith so much money and prestige in play, the German lawyer is for now firmly backing Japan\'s stance that the July 24-Aug. 9 event will go ahead, saying the IOC remains \'fully committed\'.\nBut as coronavirus infections jump from mainland China to 55 other nations and territories - with Japan suffering more than 900 cases and nine deaths including on a ship - there is growing anxiety over risks to Olympics spectators and athletes.\nThe stakes are huge for Tokyo, which would foot the entire bill for losses under its contract with the IOC should the Olympics be scrapped or moved elsewhere. But they have a strong ally in Bach, who is known to stick to his guns in adversity.\nUnder pressure around the world to fully ban Russian athletes from 2016, 2018 and 2020 Games due to doping scandals, Bach resisted, enabling them to compete as independents.\n\nThat upset many in the sports world and drew attention to his good ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBach has full control over the IOC executive board, which will make any final decision on the Tokyo Olympics.\nContractually, Japan has no say. The terms stipulate the IOC has \'sole discretion\' to assess risks and may scrap the Games for reasons including when safety is "seriously threatened."\nThe host city and Japanese Olympic body also signed away any right to indemnity, damages or compensation from the IOC.\nBach, who won fencing gold at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, took over the IOC in 2013 and has led it through whirlwind change to make the Games more attractive to cities and sponsors.\nHe has a strong grip on the 100-plus membership, having presided over the appointment of about half since taking over.\nHe has also pushed through major reforms, including Games cost cutting, additions of new sports and an overhaul of the bidding process that gave more power to his executive board - without a single vote of opposition.\nRarely showing emotion, Bach is a strategic planner and rapid implementer, with deep experience dating back to the first meeting of the IOC athletes commission in 1981.\nWith a small group of advisers and senior IOC members around him, Bach was the driving force behind a surprise decision last year to move the Games marathons and race walks to Sapporo in north Japan, to avoid the summer heat.\nA source within the Olympic movement told Reuters he had been shocked by images of athletes struggling in desert heat during the Qatar world athletics championships so he took the unilateral - albeit legal - decision to move to a cooler climate. "He did not want to see similar images in Tokyo in the summer," the source said.\n"It came out of the blue. Who proposed this, when did they propose it? These are all things I want to discuss," Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said at the time, demanding explanations.\nReuters could not reach Bach for comment on that or his role in determining the threat to the Games from the coronavirus.\nThough keen to preserve the Tokyo Olympics, Bach will also be minded to protect IOC finances. Details for Japan are not known, but at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC paid about $13 million for cancellation insurance worth $800 million.\nThe Olympic body has contributed more than $800 million dollars to the Tokyo 2020\'s Olympic Games organisational budget.\nHowever, with the Games having only been cancelled in the past due to World Wars One and Two, Bach will undoubtedly do everything in his power to protect the IOC\'s prime product - and his own presidential legacy.\n'
'888888,0,95 people are in trouble.\nCCTV reports.\nOn December 31, 2019, the first case of coronavirus infection occurred in Wuhan, China. The dangerous coronavirus spread rapidly to Asian countries. The number of deaths from the new coronavirus in China increased to 17.\n'
'888888,0,For most people in the Upper Bavarian small town of Gauting, the Chinese million metropolis of Wuhan is miles away. But this changes rapidly when an employee of a local car supplier discovers the new Coronavirus.\nIt\'s the first case in Germany. Just a few hours later, webasto\'s headquarters in the 4000-inhabitant district of Stockdorf Camerateams are swarming, and local pharmacies have a run on oral protection masks and disinfectants on Tuesday. Three other cases relating to the first are already known on Tuesday evening.\nThese, too, are Webasto employees and, like about 1000-others, worked in the Starnberg district headquarters, where the first person was employed, a spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health in Munich and the company reported on Tuesday evening. "It has been decided that the three new patients at the Munich clinic Schwabing will also be admitted stationary and will be medically monitored and isolated there," the ministry continues. "Some other contact persons are currently being tested for an infection with the Coronavirus." Further information should follow on Wednesday. Webasto temporarily closes the Stockdorf site until Sunday.\nThe first confirmed cases in Germany leave those responsible reeling. "Our night was relatively short," says the President of the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), Andreas Zapf, on Tuesday. At 20.30 o\'clock on Monday evening he is informed that the Bayer has tested positive for the corona virus. The wires have been burning ever since. Shortly before midnight the Bavarian Ministry of Health informs the public, a few hours later the Ministry\'s lobby bursts from all corners\nYeah.\nAt the press conference, experts are mapping the path that the virus, with its provisional name 2019-nCoV, has taken on its way to Germany: On the 16th. In January, a Chinese employee of Webasto receives a visit from her parents from the region of Wuhan particularly affected by the new Coronavirus in Shanghai. Three days later, she makes her way to the headquarters of her company in Germany. I have 21. In January, she participates in a training course in the Gautinger district of Stockdorf. According to her, she was still doing well.\nOnly on her return to China on the 23rd. In January, the woman feels flu, goes home to a doctor and is tested positive for the corona virus. Monday, the 27th. In January, the company management in Germany learns about the finding. It acts quickly and informs colleagues. An employee who has participated in the training together with the woman and worked in a small group can be tested. At the weekend, Zapf said he felt "flu-like, more like a severe bronchitis".\nAnd in fact, the test is positive. The family father comes immediately to the Schwabing Clinic, is closely supervised by the doctors in an isolation room with a lock and und er pressure, and is now fit again. A "healer" at the isolation station- this unusual situation makes the treating chief physician Clemens Wendtner joke: "He is awake, approachable and I would also venture the statement that he is out of danger of life." The patient has neither fever nor cough, he is "doing very well".\nHowever, the man must remain in isolation for an indefinite period of time. "We cannot yet say with certainty how long the virus of the sick person, if he is healthy, will continue to be transmitted," explains Zapf. The virus is so new that the doctors don\'t know so many things.\nYeah. Relatively rare is such a transmission: so far only three other cases have been known worldwide in which one person has contracted an infection outside China with another, which occurred in Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan. Most people also had symptoms when they infected others.\nMore suspicious cases are reported in Germany during the day. While the laboratories in the other federal states are still examining the samples, the authorities in the free state are concentrating on around 40 people with whom the German patient and the Chinese woman had closer contact. Among them are not only colleagues, but also the husband\'s family; they are to stay at home during the incubation period from up to 14 days. In the view, those responsible also have a nursery in Landsberg am Lech district, which visits the patient\'s little child. "We do not see any reason to close the crypt at the moment," a spokesman for the Land Council emphasises. "Neither the patient\'s wife nor child have been affected so far."\nIn the case of the company concerned, the employees go in and out on Tuesday- the decision on the temporary closure takes place only in the evening after the three other cases become known. Outside, the Webasto car supplier operates normally before, even if one or other of them reaches the entrance for their own hand disinfection. Most employees don\'t want to comment on the case. "No comment," it is said again and again. One employee says that there is "normal operation". However, there is also uncertainty. Another reported that it was very quiet, apparently many had actually stayed at home.\nThe pharmacies in Gauting and throughout the Worm Valley are experiencing a storm. Demands are made for disinfectants, but above all for respiratory protection.\nYeah. However, such masks make no sense, as the chairman of the German Society of Infectiology, Bernd Salzberger of the University Hospital Regensburg, stresses. The so-called surgical facial masks were not designed to protect against infections, but only to prevent infectious drops from the surgeon\'s breathing air from entering the surgical wound. "But protection against an infection from the outside is very, very bad," Salzberger explains. Martin Hoch, head of the LGL Task Force on Infectiology, also emphasises that normal hand hygiene and cough labels are sufficient.\nIn its special unit there is a very specific alarm plan with several escalation stages for cases such as the current one. Step one: doctors across the country are informed and sensitised. This took place last week. With the first confirmed case, another escalation stage has been reached: for example, information screens are now being run at the airport, including in Chinese. Stage three is when controllers take a close look at the incoming passengers and measure the temperature by a distance thermometer.\nSuch measures are also discussed by the national health ministers. Subsequently, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) informs the Tower of the state of health of passengers on flights from China prior to landing at German airports. Travellers from China should also fill out forms on how to reach them in the next thirty days so that contact persons can be identified in case of infection.\nIn the main country of China, more than 100 people have already died of the infection, most of which were elderly patients with severe pre-conditions. The total number of known diseases worldwide has now increased to more than 4500\nYeah.\nMany countries are bringing their citizens back from Wuhan, such as the UK, Belgium, Japan, South Korea, France and the USA. The Federal Government is also preparing an evacuation flight to fly volunteer Germans out of Wuhan.\nWith all due caution, those responsible keep making it clear:\'In our opinion, the risk to human health in Germany remains low\', as Minister of Health Spahn emphasises on Tuesday. "There is no need for excessive concern."\nChief physician Wendtner also considers a completely different danger much greater. "In my view, this case would be enough reason to put the prevention of influenza back in the foreground."

'888888,0,For the first time, a patient in Hong Kong also died of the virus. The hospital authorities of the Chinese Special Administrative Regions confirmed the death of a 39-year-old. As reported by the South China Morning Post, the man had previously visited the city of Wuhan, which was particularly affected by the virus. According to local media, the man suffered from other health problems that made his treatment more difficult because of the virus.\nSince the outbreak of the new lung disease, this is only the second confirmed death outside the mainland of China. On Sunday, the death of a Chinese man from Wuhan was reported in the Philippine capital Manila.\nThe Coronavirus called 2019-nCoV first appeared on a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December. Patients suffer from cough, fever, difficulty breathing, even pneumonia. Recently, the number of confirmed infections and deaths in China has risen sharply. Recently, the Chinese health authority 20.438 reported confirmed diseases, which were 3.225 new cases compared to the previous day. The number of deaths increased by 64 to 425.\nThe authorities in China are trying to contain the disease with drastic measures. For example, in the crisis region of Central China, 45 million people were killed in several cities. Overland connections with buses have been suspended, flights and trains have been reduced. The city of Wenzhou, more than 800-kilometre east of Wuhan, has imposed a curfew on the nine million inhabitants. Each family may select only one member who can go shopping every two days.\nIn Hong Kong, the authorities recorded a total of fifteen cases of Coronavirus infection. The local head of government Carrie Lam closed almost all land crossings to mainland China. Only two transitions should remain open\nYeah. Macau\'s Chinese special management zone closes its casinos for two weeks, making it a popular destination for mainland Chinese travellers.\nOn Monday, the Chinese leadership had for the first time admitted an error in dealing with the epidemic in the face of the rapidly increasing number of infections in an unusual step. The Standing Committee of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party said, according to the state news agency Xinhua, the response to the epidemic revealed "errors and difficulties" in national emergency management.\nIn the port of Yokohama in Japan, more than 3.700 passengers of a cruise ship were quarantined. The suspicion that people on board might be infected with the pathogen had arisen because of an 80-year-old passenger who had left the ship in Hong Kong a few days earlier. It was subsequently tested positively for the virus by the authorities of the Chinese Special Administrative Zone.\nThe 80-year-old had travelled aboard the Diamond Princess of the British-American cruise company Carnival. Carnival confirms that the loading time of the ship will be delayed by approximately 24 hours so that the authorities can check the health of the 2.666 guests and 1.045 crew members on board.\nTwenty cases of Coronavirus infection have so far been reported in Japan. More than 500 Japanese have since been flown out of the Central Chinese million metropolis of Wuhan.\n'
'888888,0,United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended calling the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world the "Chinese Virus" and said that he is pushing back against the false narrative of China that the US military did this.\n\n"Well, China was putting out information which was false that our military did this to them. That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China," the president told reporters at a White House news conference.\n"So I think it\'s a very accurate term. I didn\'t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody," Trump said.\nAn hour later, he started his meeting with CEOs of the hotel and tourism industry by using the term "China Virus".\nTrump refuted the notion that his using of the phrase created a stigma against the Chinese.\n"I don\'t think so. I think saying that our military did to them creates a stigma," he asserted.\nDuring the news conference, Trump said he took the right decision by imposing a travel ban on China.\nHe replied in the negative when asked about disruption in the supply chain given that many precursors for pharmaceuticals come from China.\n"No, I don\'t see that at all and I think China has every incentive to make sure that things work well. China wants to make sure that things work very well," Trump said.\nThe US President said he did not expect China not honouring its trade deal commitment of buying things from the US as a result of the coronavirus.\n"Well they need our product very badly... We have a good relationship with China. We have a signed agreement. They\'re going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product," he said.\nRight now, he said, China has been sending the US everything it needs. "But we are looking at some alternatives," he added.\nThe US and China have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting conspiracy theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Beijing accusing American officials of stigmatizing an entire nation.\nIn his original tweet on Monday, Trump described US airlines and other industries being "particularly affected by the Chinese Virus".\nOn Tuesday, he tweeted that some US states were "being hit hard by the Chinese Virus".\nTrump\'s allies had previously referred to the pandemic as the "Chinese coronavirus", but Beijing said it was "strongly indignant" over the phrase, which it called "a kind of stigmatization".\nThe US should "immediately stop its unjustified accusations against China," Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing.\nA commentary by the official Xinhua news agency said using "racist and xenophobic names to cast blame for the outbreak on other countries can only reveal politicians\' irresponsibility and incompetence which will intensify virus fears."\nThe war of words reignited diplomatic tensions between the two countries, which have tussled over trade and other disputes since Trump took office.\nTrump\'s comments were also criticized inside the US, with warnings it could incite a backlash against the Asian-American community.\n"Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don\'t need you fuelling more bigotry," tweeted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose state is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the country.\nThe World Health Organization said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China.\nThe new coronavirus was first detected late last year, with China\'s own health officials initially saying its source was a live animal market in the central city of Wuhan, whose government had initially tried to cover up the outbreak.\nBut China has sought to distance itself from the virus, saying the origin is still unknown, while seeking global goodwill by offering aid to countries facing serious outbreaks.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels "to shift blame for COVID-19 to the US", the State Department said.\nPompeo "stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat", the department added.\nThe State Department on Friday summoned Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai to denounce Beijing\'s promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter last week that "patient zero" in the global pandemic may have come from the US.\n"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation," tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.\nPompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to the "Wuhan virus" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.\nYang issued a "stern warning to the US that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail", Xinhua said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.\nThe key Chinese foreign policy leader "noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people", Xinhua said.\nYang called on the US side to "correct its wrongful behaviour".\nTrump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his backers have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.\nWhile COVID-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.\n'

In India, the number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases has gone up to 110, according to the health ministry.\n'
'888888,0,From other countries, up to now, the top ones are 25 in Thailand, 24 in Singapore, 17 in Hong Kong, 16 in South Korea, 13 in Australia, 12 in Germany, etc.\nFrom the perspective of infection routes in Japan, in addition to the infected persons of this cruise ship, they can be roughly divided into the following categories:\nFirst: there are 11 tourists, guides and Chinese in Japan who have been to Wuhan.\nAs Japan\'s Ministry of health, labor and welfare said Thursday, it has been confirmed that 30-year-old Chinese men in Kanagawa County, who have returned to Wuhan, have been infected with new viral pneumonia. Now the men have recovered and discharged, which is the first time in Japan to confirm such patients.\n24, the Ministry of health and labour announced that more than 40 year old male infected with the new coronavirus from Wuhan, Hubei, China, had symptoms of pneumonia. This is the second confirmed new virus infection in Japan.\nAfter that, Japan\'s Ministry of health, labor and welfare successively published such examples.\nSecond: the Japanese infected with the new coronavirus pneumonia and the asymptomatic viral carriers of coronavirus infected by Japanese charter flights or government planes. A total of 9.\nSo far, the Japanese government has chartered civil aircraft three times and dispatched government chartered aircraft to pick up the Japanese in Wuhan. At present, there are 565 Japanese returning home.\nOf the first group of people returning home, 3 were infected with the virus. 1 of them were diagnosed as pneumonia with the new coronavirus infection, and the other 2 were asymptomatic pathogen carriers. Another person was negative at the first test and then positive again.\nAmong the second group of returnees, 2 were asymptomatic pathogen carriers. Another January 31st examination was negative, pneumonia appeared in February 1st, and 4 days later, it was confirmed that it had contracted the new coronavirus pneumonia.\nAmong the third group of returnees, one was infected with coronavirus pneumonia; one was an asymptomatic pathogen carrier, and the asymptomatic pathogen carrier fell ill on February 3.\nThe third category is the driver and guide who receive Chinese tourists, a total of three.\nA bus driver in Nara was infected with a new coronavirus pneumonia. He delivered 2 passengers from Wuhan to the group on 8~11 and 12~16 January.\nIn 9 days, the driver carries about 60 tourists from Wuhan\n。 The female guide who took the same bus was also diagnosed with infection. The guide is a more than 40 year old non Japanese woman living in Osaka city. She and the driver two once received a tour group from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. A more than 20 year old female tour guide living in Chiba County, who was infected with a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, was infected with the Dalian tourism team from 17 to 22, while the driver was infected with the new type of coronavirus pneumonia in Nara.\nWhy does Japan become the country with the largest number of infected people outside the mainland of China?\nFirst of all, Japan has recently become the most popular overseas tourist destination for Chinese tourists. In 2019, the number of foreign tourists to Japan exceeded 9.5 million for the first time, accounting for the first time in the world.\nAccording to "where have more than 5 million people left Wuhan?" published on January 26 on the first financial website of Chinese media? The chart of top 20 international transportation capacity of Wuhan Tianhe Airport quoted in big data tells you that from December 30 to January 22, 9080 people arrived at Narita Airport from the airport; 6272 people arrived at Kansai International Airport, 2656 arrived at Nagoya Central Airport, 18008 in total, accounting for the first number of passengers from the Airport to all countries in the world.\nAccording to the website of the people\'s Government of Hubei Province published in Hubei Daily on January 8, 2018, 19000 foreigners live in Hubei According to the survey results, among the foreigners who come to Hubei for employment and entrepreneurship, 57% are from Asia. The top 10 countries are Japan, South Korea, the United States, India, France, Canada, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Italy. 81% of foreigners gather in Wuhan, and most in Yichang and Xiangyang. "\nThese factors, at the time of the outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, make Japan the country with the largest number of infected persons outside the mainland of China.\n'
'888888,0,"Just stay calm, it\'ll go away"--little is more dangerous in the US at the moment than Donald Trump would think. It may be helpful, given the clumsiness surrounding toilet paper in supermarkets, the theft of respiratory masks and other hysterical reactions to the worldwide spread of the Coronavirus, if a president tries to calm the population. Trump\'s repeated assertions that no one has to worry, but have a different quality. They lead to lightness, while great caution is long overdue. You\'re imagining security where there aren\'t any. They put people and markets at additional risk, as if everything was not bad enough already.\nWhat the country expects is quickly described, because it is likely to happen everywhere. The CDC health authority warns: many will become infected, of which 15 to 20 percent will be seriously ill, there will be many more deaths, all of which can no longer be prevented. Or better yet, it was never completely preventable. Which is why Trump\'s first reaction to the Corona outbreak was absolutely right: strict entry restrictions. Their main aim was to delay the arrival of the pandemic and thus buy time.\nBut Trump didn\'t use that time. Perhaps even because he himself believes what he says in the microphone that this virus is "not such a big deal" and has done all that is necessary, that the crisis is only written by his opponents so that the economy breaks in to harm him. There are even reports that the President fears journalists might try to pin it on him. Nevertheless, he continues to shake every hand held to him. And he wants to continue to be cheered on in the campaigns of thousandYeah.\nTrump\'s focus is quite clear, despite all the setbacks: he has realised t hat the Corona crisis is threatening his re-election and he is fighting it with the means at his disposal. He cannot be the President who is trusted by the people in this crisis, who overcomes the political divide with leadership, because it is bigger these days. Trump does not even realize what an opportunity he is missing: think of the pictures of politicians in rubber boots who give the rulers in flood areas during election years, if he had made this crisis his priority early on, it would certainly not have harmed him.\nInstead, Trump acts as autocrats do: questioning the facts, arguing with questionable figures, withholding information, attacking the media, announcing bad news, attempting to suppress expert judgements and expose his own fabrications as truth.\nJust a few examples: the White House, according to the AP news agency, prevented health experts from warning older and thus particularly vulnerable citizens of air travel, probably in order to avoid further burdening the industry. An annual intelligence assessment of the global threat situation for the US, which was already on the agenda in Congress, was cancelled: the Time Magazine reports that the report would warn that the US is still not well prepared for a global pandemic, as it was in the years before. Trump\'s unsustainable claim: he is also available to anyone who needs a test for the virus, which is still not true after initial problems. And the admission that "I like the numbers as they are right now"--the President obviously has no interest in testing as much as possible and documenting the spread; more cases would mean that there might be cause for concerYeah.\nTrump seems to think he can control what happens if he taps a few words and delivers the right images accusing Democrats and their voters, repeatedly calling Fake News and conspiracy, which has often worked. Otherwise, among other things, the procedure for revoking the office of President would have been different. But to contain Corona, it is not enough for the Republicans to participate and applaud the base. And even if Trump, in addition to all the contradictory and bizarre appearances, causes one or other of these reasonable actions: he basically fights against himself and can only lose.\nFor far too many Americans will follow his example and not stick to the facts, they will distrust any serious reporting and the warnings of health experts, and therefore make bad decisions, i.e. increase the rate of infection. Or they can see through it and see the country slip into the crisis because this President has not been able to withstand the virus, which is already causing panic in the economy, at least. Trump plays down the Corona risk and wants to present the image of a perfect crisis manager because he wants to reassure the markets in particular. But he who buys it from him makes a grave mistake.\nMany Americans are under a lot of pressure to drag themselves to work sick anyway. As long as the state does not intervene drastically, hardly anyone will stay at home voluntarily who is not fortunate enough to be able to move easily to the home office. Far too few people have been tested to know how widespread the virus is already in the US. Slowly, the authorities are getting to grips with the bottlenecks, so they will get an overview that other countries already have. All this suggests that the case numbers will rise very sooYeah.\nRight now, therefore, he has one last chance to get the situation under control. Once hospitals can no longer cope with the influx of patients, argue with companies and many lose their jobs or cannot afford a doctor\'s visit anyway, It is too late. It will not be done with the tax relief and financial aid that has been envisaged so far for some sectors and employees, even vaguely indicated by Trump. But it seems the President is still waiting for the right moment, which he has long missed. And with him awaits those who give him too much faith and do not worry. That makes hysterical hamster races almost reasonable.\nAt the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organisation, WHO, the incidence of pneumonia of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).\nSars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 are the same pathogens that infect bats. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003 about 8.000 people more than 750 died. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, and every third party has died from it.\nOverall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.\nMedical practitioners assume that the virus is transmitted from person to person mainly by drip infection.\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nMore than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers suspect roughly somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.\nFollow the progress of registered cases in Germany on this map.\nThe number of infected worldwide tested positive for Corona shows this map from Johns Hopkins University.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO is treating the disease as a pandemic. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.\nTypical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinationYeah. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccination'

"888888,0,SINGAPORE — To help the hospitality and tourism-related businesses stay afloat during the Covid-19 outbreak, consumers who are not sick should still dine out, a representative of online travel firm Asia Expedia Group said.\xa0 \n “Go out, travel, eat,” Mr Ang Choo Pin, the group’s senior director, said. “Right now is the time for plenty of very good deals.\xa0 \n “I've noticed that some of the best restaurants where it was hard to get a reservation for, it's now getting easier. \n “Singaporeans love staycations… and some hotels are offering great deals.” \n His remarks were made during a panel discussion hosted by Singapore’s American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), which released a business survey on Wednesday (Feb 26) showing that the travel and hospitality industries here have been impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak the most. \n Done between Feb 12 and 18 and opened to AmCham Singapore members in these industries, the online survey aimed to understand the outbreak’s impact on companies’ operations, the business environment in Singapore, and the outlook on the region. \n Of the 225 firms that took the survey, 78 per cent of them reported that the coronavirus outbreak has had an extensive or moderate impact on their business operations — both within Singapore and the broader Asia-Pacific. \n For those in the hospitality and travel sector, this figure was 88 per cent. The survey also found that half of those in this sector are expecting more than 20 per cent losses in revenue. \n Analysts told TODAY earlier this month that Singapore’s tourism sector is likely to take a hit in the next six to eight months. \n A fifth of the international visitors here are from China, and visitors who have travelled to China in the past 14 days are banned from entering Singapore during this period. \n As of Wednesday, Singapore is the country with the fifth-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases outside China — after South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran. \n The governments of India, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar and South Korea have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Singapore as well.\xa0 \n However, Mr Ang\xa0of Asia Expedia Group is staying positive and hopeful that things will look up for these industries. \n “One thing we have to bear in mind is that tourism has traditionally been a very resilient industry,” he said. \n Referring to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003 that was caused by a coronavirus, he recalled how the number of arrivals of tourists dropped to 4.7 million but went up to 7 million just two years later. \n “That’s a 40 per cent increase and it rebounded to an extent that was even greater than pre-Sars, so I think it kind of tells you how this might go.” \n CONFIDENCE IN SINGAPORE AS BUSINESS HUB\xa0 \n The upside is that the AmCham survey showed that 98 per cent of the firms still have long-term confidence in Singapore as a business hub and destination.\xa0 \n A key reason for this is due to the Government’s handling of the outbreak.\xa0 \n An overwhelming 97 per cent of the firms in the survey said that the Government has been effective in communicating health and safety updates with regards to the outbreak, while 79 per cent of the firms said that the Government has been effective in addressing the potential economic impact of this public health crisis.\xa0 \n SCENARIO PLANNING FOR BUSINESSES \n Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry who was present at the AmCham event, said during a dialogue session that there are three key scenarios Singapore could possibly face in the coming weeks and months. \n Scenario 1  The impact from the outbreak is sharp but there is a “very quick recovery”.\xa0 \n This was the case with Sars when the mortality rate was 10 per cent but the outbreak did not last long. The first infected patient landed in Singapore in March 2003 and the country was declared Sars-free in May by the World Health Organization.\xa0 \n However, this scenario is unlikely because the Covid-19 coronavirus is infectious but the mortality is very low. Outside of China, less than 1 per cent of patients have died.\xa0 \n So this outbreak may last longer than one that has a very high mortality rate. \n Scenario 2 \n The virus takes some time to be eradicated.\xa0 \n Mr Chan said: “We must be prepared that if need be, we must put in other measures to work with the businesses to overcome this crisis in a more prolonged time period that was originally envisaged.” \n He also said that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has already given Singaporeans the assurance that the Government is closely monitoring all measures in the next two to three months to see whether they should be adjusted according to the appropriate conditions and needs. \n Scenario 3 \n The virus mutates into something that causes symptoms similar to the seasonal flu, becoming endemic within the world's population.\xa0 \n Singapore may then have to deal with the virus in a similar way that it would a common flu. \n “And then we would then have to find ways to see how we can get back to normalcy (while still taking certain) precautions, Mr Chan said, without elaborating\xa0on what these precautions would be.\xa0 \n He emphasised that at this point, it is still too premature to say which of the three scenarios will likely take place, but businesses should begin “mental preparations” by using these scenarios to best position themselves for recovery. \n “For those of you who are familiar with the scenario-planning methodology, you will know that we are not trying to forecast which is the scenario.\xa0 \n “We are just trying to ask ourselves: If any of these three scenarios happen, are our businesses prepared to handle the consequences of that, and that is how we stress-test our business plan to see whether they are robust enough for the different scenarios.” \n STRENGTH IN UNITY\xa0 \n A key point that Mr Chan repeated a few times during the dialogue session was how businesses and Singaporeans need to band together as one. \n “We have to do this together. Big businesses have to help the small businesses and we all have to help each other. We need to have a sense that we are all in this together. \n “If the supply chain breaks, even if it's the smallest part of it, it disrupts the entire supply chain.\xa0 \n “In Singapore, we must also distinguish ourselves that unlike places elsewhere, it is not a situation whereby it’s every man for his own. There's a certain communitarian spirit in this, which is that we will get through this, we'll get through this together as one. In order to do that, we have to help each other,” he said. \n "

'888888,0,TORONTO - Canada\'s health system is preparing for an influx of coronavirus patients in the midst of a long-running bed shortage, calling doctors out of retirement and ramping down any treatment that can wait.  \n A shortage of beds during periods of peak demand, like the flu season, is a longstanding problem in the publicly funded system. While health spending has risen gradually in recent years, beds have not kept pace with population growth.  \n "You\'ve got people in broom closets and auditoriums and conference rooms across the country," said Michael Gardam, chief of staff at one Ontario\'s newest hospitals, the 656-bed Humber River Hospital.  \n Canada has 925 cases of the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, and 12 deaths.  \n A preliminary model published by Canadian researchers this week estimated that if cases increase by 7.5 percent each day, Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, will run out of ICU beds and ventilators in about 37 days. [https://www.covid-19-mc.ca/]  \n Between Sunday and Thursday, daily case counts grew an average of 16% a day.  \n In British Columbia, which has seen the most virus-linked deaths in Canada, the majority of hospitals are running between 110% and 140% of their official capacity, said Christine Sorensen, president of the BC Nurses\' Union.  \n Most current Canadian hospitals were built between the 1940-1960s, under a federal program. Budget cuts forced closures, and in recent years, growing demand for long-term care has further strained the system.  \n Canada had 12.9 adult intensive care beds per 100,000 people, according to a study based on 2013-14 data, with variations across the country. British Columbia had only 10.5 beds, and the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador had 21.8, according to a report from Canadian Institute for Health Information.  \n Quebec\'s government recently said it has 1,000 ICU beds, or 11.8 per 100,000.  \n In contrast, the United States had 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 as of 2009, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information.  \n  \n CARE BY EMAIL AND IN HOTELS  \n With little time left to prepare, officials are moving to make the most of what they have.  \n British Columbia\'s College of Physicians and Surgeons put a call out to doctors who retired in the last two years to re-register under a special emergency class.  \n Ontario told hospitals this week to ramp down elective surgeries and non-urgent treatment. It also said it would invest C$100 million (£60.01 million) to increase capacity, but it is not clear how quickly that can be done.  \n An Ontario committee set up to address the crisis is looking at how to move more patients out of hospitals and into long-term care or home with care, a document obtained by Reuters showed.  \n Alberta is enabling doctors to bill for phone consultations, in an effort to keep patients at home.  \n Its College of Physicians and Surgeons told doctors that unregulated technology, like email and texting, may be justified under the "extraordinary circumstances."  \n Some hospitals have the capacity to re-open beds that have been closed over the years, said Michael Hurley, president of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, but that is not occurring quickly enough.  \n "So far we haven\'t talked about approaching this virus with the intensity that the Chinese have," said Hurley, citing China\'s move to open up thousands of hospital beds in a matter of days to handle the influx of coronavirus patients. China assembled new hospitals in Wuhan using prefabricated buildings.  \n One top priority will be protecting healthcare workers, for their own safety and so they can continue to see patients.  \n "It\'s going to be a burden on the staff; it\'s going to be a burden on the system," said Paul-Émile Cloutier, president of hospital advocacy group HealthCareCAN.  \n "The challenges of COVID-19 underscore the challenges that already exist in the system."

Experts have discovered the pathogen - this is the new coronavirus.\nAbout Who recognizes the international significance of an emergency outbreak and officially calls the disease covid-19. The number of people infected in mainland China has exceeded 77000, 2663 died and more than 27000 cured.

"888888,0,In Japan, on board\nCruise vessel ten infections of the Coronavirus have been detected. The infected were taken to the hospital in Tokyo's neighbouring province of Kanagawa. According to Princess Cruises, eight German passengers are also on board. A spokesman for the Ministry of Health could not say whether the Germans were tested positive. The German Embassy in Tokyo also had no information at first. In Japan, therefore, 33 cases have been confirmed.\nThe remaining 3.700 passengers and crew members should remain on board for another 14 days, said Health Minister Katsunobu Kato. He referred to the previous findings that it may take up to 14 days for the Coronavirus infected to show the first symptoms. The ship had returned to Yokohama, near Tokyo, after landing in ports in Vietnam, Taiwan and other cities in Japan.\nIt was quarantined in the port of Yokohama on Monday. The reason for the quarantine was an 80-year-old boy from Hong Kong who tested positive for the corona virus on Saturday. The man was at 20. In January in Tokyo's neighboring city Yokohama rose and left the Diamond Princess in Hong Kong five days later, it was said. The ten people now diagnosed had all either had symptoms or had close contact with the man.\nMeanwhile, the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the Coronavirus has continued to rise in China. Until Wednesday, further 3.887 infections have been registered, as reported by the Beijing Health Commission, currently 24.324. The number of deaths increased by 65 to 490. The Health Commission also counts more than 23.000 suspicious cases.\nOutside mainland China, there are more than 230 confirmed infections in more than two dozen countries, twelve of them in Germany.\nYeah. Two people died in Hong Kong and the Philippines. According to the doctors, the twelve patients are doing well in Germany. In addition to two infected people who had been flown out of Wuhan on Saturday with other Germans, there are ten patients in Bavaria who are related to the Webasto car supplier. Two of them have a mild fever. The German infected on the Canary Island of La Gomera is also well, according to the authorities.\nThe radical measures to contain the epidemic have led to a drastic slowdown in public life in China. Many factories and offices are still closed for the time being. Supply chains are often interrupted as well. Like Lufthansa, many airlines have cancelled their Chinese flights. The impact on economic life is enormous.\n"
'888888,0,MILAN/SEOUL - In Italy, millions are locked down and more than 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus. In South Korea, hit by the disease at about the same time, only a few thousand are quarantined and 67 people have died. As the virus courses through the world, the story of two outbreaks illustrates a coming problem for countries now grappling with an explosion in cases.  \n It\'s impractical to test every potential patient, but unless the authorities can find a way to see how widespread infection is, their best answer is lockdown.  \n Italy started out testing widely, then narrowed the focus so that now, the authorities don\'t have to process hundreds of thousands of tests. But there\'s a trade-off: They can\'t see what\'s coming and are trying to curb the movements of the country\'s entire population of 60 million people to contain the disease. Even Pope Francis, who has a cold and delivered his Sunday blessing over the internet from inside the Vatican, said he felt "caged in the library."  \n Thousands of miles away in South Korea, authorities have a different response to a similar-sized outbreak. They are testing hundreds of thousands of people for infections and tracking potential carriers like detectives, using cell phone and satellite technology.  \n Both countries saw their first cases of the disease called COVID-19 in late January. South Korea has since reported 67 deaths out of nearly 8,000 confirmed cases, after testing more than 222,000 people. In contrast, Italy has had 1,016 deaths and identified more than 15,000 cases after carrying out more than 73,000 tests on an unspecified number of people.  \n Epidemiologists say it is not possible to compare the numbers directly. But some say the dramatically different outcomes point to an important insight: Aggressive and sustained testing is a powerful tool for fighting the virus.  \n Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, said extensive testing can give countries a better picture of the extent of an outbreak. When testing in a country is limited, he said, the authorities have to take bolder actions to limit movement of people.  \n "I\'m uncomfortable with enforced lockdown-type movement restrictions," he said. "China did that, but China is able to do that. China has a population that will comply with that."  \n The democracies of Italy and South Korea are useful case studies for countries such as America, which have had problems setting up testing systems and are weeks behind on the infection curve. So far, in Japan and the United States particularly, the full scale of the problem is not yet visible. Germany has not experienced significant testing constraints, but Chancellor Angela Merkel warned her people on Wednesday that since 60% to 70% of the populace is likely to be infected, the only option is containment.  \n South Korea, which has a slightly smaller population than Italy at about 50 million people, has around 29,000 people in self-quarantine. It has imposed lockdowns on some facilities and at least one apartment complex hit hardest by outbreaks. But so far no entire regions have been cut off.  \n Seoul says it is building on lessons learned from an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 and working to make as much information available as possible to the public. It has embarked on a massive testing programme, including people who have very mild illness, or perhaps don\'t even have symptoms, but who may be able to infect others.  \n This includes enforcing a law that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease. The authorities can then make some of this public, so anyone who may have been exposed can get themselves - or their friends and family members - tested.  \n In addition to helping work out who to test, South Korea\'s data-driven system helps hospitals manage their pipeline of cases. People found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through a smartphone app, or checked regularly in telephone calls, until a hospital bed becomes available. When a bed is available, an ambulance picks the person up and takes the patient to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms. All of this, including hospitalization, is free of charge.  \n South Korea\'s response is not perfect. While more than 209,000 people have tested negative there, results are still pending on about 18,000 others - an information gap that means there are likely more cases in the pipeline. The rate of newly confirmed cases has dropped since a peak in mid-February, but the system\'s greatest test may still be ahead as authorities try to track and contain new clusters. South Korea does not have enough protective masks - it has started rationing them - and it is trying to hire more trained staff to process tests and map cases.  \n And the approach comes at the cost of some privacy. South Korea\'s system is an intrusive mandatory measure that depends on people surrendering what, for many in Europe and America, would be a fundamental right of privacy. Unlike China and the island-state of Singapore, which have used similar methods, South Korea is a large democracy with a population that is quick to protest policies it does not like.  \n "Disclosing information about patients always comes with privacy infringement issues," said Choi Jaewook, a preventive medicine professor at Korea University and a senior official at the Korean Medical Association. Disclosures "should be strictly limited" to patients\' movements, and "it shouldn\'t be about their age, their sex, or their employers."  \n Traditional responses such as locking down affected areas and isolating patients can be only modestly effective, and may cause problems in open societies, says South Korea\'s Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip. In South Korea\'s experience, he told reporters on Monday, lockdowns mean people participate less in tracing contacts they may have had. "Such an approach," he said, "is close-minded, coercive, and inflexible."  \n  \n ITALY "AT THE LIMIT"  \n Italy and South Korea are more than 5,000 miles apart, but there are several similarities when it comes to coronavirus. Both countries\' main outbreaks were initially clustered in smaller cities or towns, rather than in a major metropolis - which meant the disease quickly threatened local health services. And both involved doctors who decided to ignore testing guidelines.  \n Italy\'s epidemic kicked off last month. A local man with flu symptoms was diagnosed after he had told medical staff he had not been to China and discharged himself, said Massimo Lombardo, head of local hospital services in Lodi.  \n The diagnosis was only made after the 38-year-old, whose name has only been given as Mattia, returned to the hospital. Testing guidelines at the time said it was not necessary to test people who had no link to China or other affected areas. But an anaesthetist pushed the protocols and decided to go ahead and test for COVID-19 anyway, Lombardo said. Now, some experts in Italy believe Mattia may have been infected through Germany, rather than China.  \n Decisions about testing hinge partly on what can be done with people who test positive, at a time when the healthcare system is already under stress. In Italy at first, regional authorities tested widely and counted all positive results in the published total, even if people did not have symptoms.  \n Then, a few days after the patient known as Mattia was found to have COVID-19, Italy changed tack, only testing and announcing cases of people with symptoms. The authorities said this was the most effective use of resources: The risk of contagion seemed lower from patients with no symptoms, and limited tests help produce reliable results more quickly. The approach carried risks: People with no symptoms still can be infected and spread the virus.  \n On the other hand, the more you test the more you find, so testing in large numbers can put hospital systems under strain, said Massimo Antonelli, director of intensive care at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. Testing involves elaborate medical processes and follow-up. "The problem is actively searching for cases," he said. "It means simply the numbers are big."  \n Italy has a generally efficient health system, according to international studies. Its universal healthcare receives funding below the European Union average but is comparable with South Korea\'s, at 8.9% of GDP against 7.3% in South Korea, according to the World Health Organization.  \n Now, that system has been knocked off balance. Staff are being brought into accident and emergency departments, holidays have been cancelled and doctors say they are delaying non-urgent operations to free up intensive care beds.  \n Pier Luigi Viale, head of the infectious disease unit at Sant\' Orsola-Malpighi hospital in Bologna, is working around the clock - in three jobs. His hospital is handling multiple coronavirus cases. His doctors are shuttling to other hospitals and clinics in the area to lend their expertise and help out with cases. In addition, his doctors also have to deal with patients with other contagious diseases who are struggling to survive.  \n "If it drags on for weeks or months we\'ll need more reinforcements," he told Reuters.  \n Last week, the mayor of Castiglione d\'Adda, a town of about 5,000 people in Lombardy\'s "red zone" which was the first to be locked down, made an urgent online appeal for help. He said his small town had had to close its hospital and was left with one doctor to treat more than 100 coronavirus patients. Three of the town\'s four doctors were sick or in self quarantine.  \n "Doctors and nurses are at the limit," said a nurse from the hospital where Mattia was taken in. "If you have to manage people under artificial respiration you have to be watching them constantly, you can\'t look after the new cases that come in."  \n Studies so far suggest that every positive case of coronavirus can infect two other people, so local authorities in Lombardy have warned that the region\'s hospitals face a serious crisis if the spread continues - not just for COVID-19 patients but also for others whose treatment has been delayed or disrupted. As the crisis spreads into Italy\'s less prosperous south, the problems will be magnified.  \n Intensive care facilities face the most intense pressure. They require specialist staff and expensive equipment and are not set up for mass epidemics. In total, Italy has around 5,000 intensive care beds. In the winter months, some of these are already occupied by patients with respiratory problems. Lombardy and Veneto have just over 1,800 intensive care beds between public and private systems, only some of which can be set aside for COVID-19 patients.  \n The government has asked regional authorities to increase the number of intensive care places by 50% and to double the number of beds for respiratory and contagious diseases, while reorganising staff rosters to ensure adequate staffing. Some 5,000 respirators have been acquired for intensive care stations, the first of which are due to arrive on Friday, deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said.  \n The region has already asked nursing institutes to allow students to bring forward their graduation to get more nurses into the system early. Pools of intensive care specialists and anaesthetists are to be set up, including staff from outside the worst affected regions.  \n To add to the burden, hospitals in Italy depend on medical personnel to try to trace the contacts that people who test positive have had with others. One doctor in Bologna, who asked not to be named, said he had spent a 12-hour day tracing people who had been in contact with just one positive patient, to ensure those who next need testing are found.  \n "You can do that if the number of cases remains two to three," the doctor said. "But if they grow, something has to give. The system will implode if we continue to test everyone actively and then have to do all this."  \n  \n "MAXIMUM POWER"  \n In South Korea as in Italy, an early case of COVID-19 was identified when a medical officer followed their intuition, rather than the official guidelines, on testing.  \n The country\'s first case was a 35-year-old Chinese woman who tested positive on Jan. 20. But the largest outbreak was detected after the 31st patient, a 61-year-old woman from South Korea\'s southeastern city of Daegu, was diagnosed on Feb. 18.  \n Like the patient named Mattia in Italy, the woman had no known links to Wuhan, the Chinese province where the disease was first identified. And as in Italy, the doctors\' decision to recommend a test went against guidelines at the time to test people who had been to China or been in contact with a confirmed case, said Korea Medical Association\'s Choi Jaewook.  \n "Patient 31," as she became known, was a member of a secretive church which Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip said has since linked to 61% of cases. Infections spread beyond the congregation after the funeral of a relative of the church\'s founder was held at a nearby hospital, and there were several other smaller clusters around the country.  \n Once the church cluster was identified, South Korea opened around 50 drive-through testing facilities around the country.  \n In empty parking lots, medical staff in protective clothing lean into cars to check their passengers for fever or breathing difficulties, and if needed, collect samples. The process usually takes about 10 minutes, and people usually receive the results in a text reminding them to wash their hands regularly and wear face masks.  \n A total of 117 institutions in South Korea have equipment to conduct the tests, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The numbers fluctuate daily, but an average of 12,000 is possible, and maximum capacity is 20,000 tests a day. The government pays for tests of people with symptoms, if referred by a doctor. Otherwise, people who want to be tested can pay up to 170,000 won ($140), said an official at a company called Seegene Inc, which supplies 80% of the country\'s kits and says it can test 96 samples at once.  \n There are also 130 quarantine officers like Kim Jeong-hwan, who focus on minute details to track potential patients. The 28-year-old public health doctor spends his whole working days remotely checking up on people who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.  \n Kim, who is doing military service, is one of a small army of quarantine officers who track the movements of any potential carriers of the disease by phone, app or the signals sent by cell phones or the black boxes in automobiles. Their goal: To trace all the contacts people may have had, so they too can be tested.  \n "I haven\'t seen anyone telling bad lies," Kim said. "But lots of people generally don\'t remember exactly what they did."  \n Underlining their determination, quarantine officers told Reuters they located five cases after a worker in a small town caught the virus and went to work in a "coin karaoke," a bar where a machine lets people sing a few songs for a dollar. At first, the woman, who was showing symptoms, did not tell the officers where she worked, local officials told Reuters. But they put the puzzle together after questioning her acquaintances and obtaining GPS locations on her mobile device.  \n "Now, quarantine officers have maximum power and authority," said Kim Jun-geun, an official at Changnyeong County who collects information from quarantine officers.  \n South Korea\'s government also uses location data to customize mass messages sent to cellphones, notifying every resident when and where a nearby case is confirmed.  \n Lee Hee-young, a preventative medicine expert who is also running the coronavirus response team in South Korea\'s Gyeonggi province, said South Korea has gone some of the way after MERS to increase its infrastructure to respond to infectious diseases. But she said only 30% of the changes the country needs have happened. For instance, she said, maintaining a trained workforce and up-to-date infrastructure at smaller hospitals isn\'t easy.  \n "Until we fix this," Lee said, "explosions like this can keep blowing up anywhere."

"888888,0,Certain mathematical models for simulating financial markets are similar to those for studying epidemics. \n We know this because we are two financial modellers who have been involved in modelling epidemics for public health authorities. \n Here, we would like to do our bit for public education on the Covid-19 outbreak by explaining five concepts from epidemiology, which is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why.\xa0 \n The hope is that when the public is better able to understand what information about Covid-19 is shared, it will minimise irrational fear. \n KEY STATISTICS \n The media has been reporting on the number of newly infected and deaths cases daily. What is equally important is the number of recoveries, which is infrequently reported by the media. \n Imagine this: There are 10\xa0newly infected and three deaths one day.\xa0This sounds terrible, but if eight people recover on that day, then there is a net “exit” of one patient (3+8-10) from the pool. \n In any epidemic, perhaps the most important indicator is whether the net pool is increasing or decreasing. \n Another helpful statistic is the growth factor, which is each day's new cases divided by new cases from the previous day. \xa0 \n The growth factor computed from total cases reported (worldwide) was mostly below one from Feb 13 to 19, but surged back to mostly above one from Feb 20 until now, as infections began spreading rapidly beyond China to other countries. \n Sophisticated models should also consider relevant country-level statistics, such as population, density, travel frequencies, medical resources available per capita and spare capacities in health systems to cope with infectious diseases.\xa0 \n EPIDEMIC PYRAMID \n The typical classifications in an epidemic pyramid are death, severe, mild and asymptomatic, as follows:\xa0 \n  \n Learning from their Sars outbreak experience in 2003, Singapore and Taiwan have resources and operating procedures in place to reach deep down the pyramid to trace every (asymptomatic) case possible even before symptoms are shown. \xa0 \n But let’s be realistic.\xa0No matter how effective the screening process is, there will be misdiagnosis. \n Initial statistics collected from any outbreak almost always understate the full burden.\xa0 \n For example, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially estimated 12,469 deaths for the H1N1 virus in the US from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010. But by 2019, it increased its estimate for that period to at least 75,000 deaths, or six times the earlier figure. \n Initial observed fatality statistics can be used to project the full burden with data that may take months or even years to arrive.\xa0This is called a cross-sectional problem because we take one cross section of the pyramid to make an educated guess on the size of a deeper cross section of the pyramid.\xa0 \n Case fatality rate is the number of deaths over a defined period of time divided by the number of individuals diagnosed with the disease during that time.\xa0 \n This is a different problem by focusing on the time dimension. As long as epidemic models are careful in drawing conclusions from data already available at specific time points, they can still provide helpful insights. \n TOCC (TRAVEL, OCCUPATION, CONTACT, CLUSTER) TRACING \n Some countries may be too big in physical size. Many lack the resources to test and diagnose every suspected case.\xa0 \n Moreover, many patients avoid seeking medical help until they show severe symptoms. As a result, we have to assume that a portion of undiagnosed patients may still be infecting others in the overall population.\xa0 \n As long as there is a way to perform TOCC tracing from the diagnosed cases, there is a path to slow down the spread of infections.\xa0 \n Public health officials worry the most about infections from unknown sources\xa0— also known as the silent patients\xa0— in which contacts cannot be back-traced easily.\xa0 \n When the silent patients include say a taxi driver, he or she may have infected some passengers with no easy way to trace all related passengers riding his/her taxi.\xa0 \n That is how epidemic control can become extremely challenging.\xa0 \n Those were the worrying signs observed in the early stages in Wuhan and Hubei, and perhaps we are noticing similar patterns emerging in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy.\xa0\xa0 \n TREATMENTS \n From an epidemiological point of view, patients are removed from the pool by either recoveries or deaths.\xa0 \n The human body does have natural mechanisms to rid itself of viruses including the Covid-19 virus, but that is not always successful before the onset of other fatal complications.\xa0 \n Therefore, the medical goal is to increase recoveries by treatments and to decrease deaths. \n Certain treatments such as antibody therapy have been around since the 1970s.\xa0The issues are what dosage to use for which types of patients, and whether there are any potential side effects.\xa0 \n Safe vaccines may take many months to develop by clinical trials.\xa0 \n In a public health emergency such as the outbreak in Wuhan, public health authorities may choose to bypass lengthy clinical trial procedures, but it is unwise if shortcuts are taken everywhere.\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n EPIDEMIC MODELS \n Epidemiologists describe the dynamics of how a disease is spread with mathematical models to better predict the effectiveness of disease control measures using “before and after” analyses. \n Impactful epidemic models require: 1) reasonable and transparent data as model parameters, or the entire exercise will become “garbage in, garbage out”; 2) a research environment where model results can be discussed openly to focus time and energy on the roughly correct models.\xa0 \n There is a legitimate policy concern that raw data may be prone to misinterpretations by potentially faulty analyses, creating unnecessary fear among the public. \n Discussions among responsible scientists can take place in a “moderated” but still expedited forum (such as on the medRxiv server co-hosted by Yale) to encourage participation and to minimise unnecessary overreactions to preliminary results. \n This way, “scientifically credible” clinical data can be released in a much shorter timeframe than the typical journal peer review process to allow other scientists to begin accessing the data, creating a win-win solution to address both scientific and public policy concerns. \n We encourage everyone with a good grasp of these concepts to review the primary sources instead of relying solely on secondary sources to interpret the statistics.\xa0 \n For example, a recent report by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre and the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London shows the estimates of the overall case fatality ratio in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of Covid-19 to be approximately 1 per cent.\xa0 \n The confidence range is from 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent.\xa0At the low end of the range or 0.5 per cent, Covid-19 is a low fatality but highly infectious disease like a terrible influenza, but public health officials may need to consider additional measures at the high end of the range or 4 per cent.\xa0 \n Armed with better understanding of information shared, the public will be more prepared until effective vaccines and treatments become widely available.\xa0 \n \xa0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Anthony G\xa0Constantinides is Professor of Communications and Signal Processing of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and heads the Financial Signal Processing Lab at Imperial College London.\xa0Imperial alumnus Dr Bernard Lee is Founder and CEO of financial analytics firm HedgeSPA and author of Investment Analytics in the Dawn of Artificial Intelligence. \n "

'888888,0,The Directorate-General for Health (DGS) clarified this Tuesday that at this time in Portugal it is not necessary to wear masks to protect against the new coronavirus, except for carers of any infected with the disease.\n"According to current indications that we have, and also in accordance with the recommendations of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), citizens are not currently required to wear masks," said Lusa Nurse Goreti da Silva, of the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Infections and Antimicrobial resistance (PPCIRA) to DGS.\nGoreti Silva also said that widespread use of the mask can give "a false sense of security".\nAs exceptional situations in which wearing masks will be necessary, Goreti da Silva pointed out caregivers or people who have had very close contact with a confirmed case of infection.\nHealthcare professionals must wear special protective equipment even in the face of suspicious cases.\nFor the general population, the nurse explains that the mask should only be used by those who travelled to the affected area by the outbreak or who had close contact with someone sick.\nIn case you experience symptoms, you will "immediately call Health Line 24" and wait for the structures to be triggered, and INEM will be responsible for transporting the patient to a reference hospital.\n"At the moment, we are at a stage where epidemiology says that it is the containment phase and at this stage it is not at all appropriate for citizens to wear this kind of mask broadly," he reiterated.\nIn the event of going from the containment phase to the mitigation phase "the rules will be different", the nurse advanced\nYeah.\n"At that time, as we do not know the number of citizens who may be contaminated, especially in public transport, in closed areas with a lot of people circulating, then the rules will be different at that stage," he said.\nIn case it is necessary to wear a mask, the nurse advised to acquire those with lateral elastic on the ear so that it can be removed without tampering with the mask and deposit it directly in the waste container.\nHe also warned that the mask must "remain firmly seated and cover the mouth, nose and side sides of the face well".\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control refers to protective masks help prevent the spread of infection and help protect those who are ill, but their use does not seem to be efficient for those who are not ill.\nThe main symptoms of (2019-nCoV) are respiratory and may be common or flu-like: fever, cough, respiratory distress, muscle pain and tiredness. There are patients who develop viral pneumonia and even septicaemia.\nThe preliminary analyses carried out on the 20-person returnees from Portugal, who arrived in Lisbon on Sunday, had negative results.\nThe 18th Portuguese and two Brazilians will remain in prophylactic isolation for four days in dedicated facilities for this purpose at Pulido Valente Hospital (Hospital Hospital Hospital in Lisbon Norte) and Lisbon Health Park.\nChina rose this Tuesday for 426 dead and more than twenty thousand infected with the balance of the pneumonia outbreak caused by the new coronavirus detected last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, placed under quarantine.\n'

"888888,0,The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) epidemic is knocking on Indian doors after infecting tens of thousands of people in over 60 countries across the world. This week, India reported three fresh coronavirus cases, taking the total number of confirmed infections in the country to six. And since then, focus has increasingly shifted to the fallout impact of the new Covid-19 cases and to the question of how ready the country is to fight the global outbreak.\nCovid-19 first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The disease, that leads to illnesses ranging from common cold, fever, shortness of breath to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death, is caused by a kind of coronavirus never seen before. This led to the virus initially being called novel coronavirus 2019 (nCov-19). The disease was later formally labelled Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19). In the media, it's being widely called coronavirus.\nAs of Tuesday, coronavirus has infected more than 89,000 people in over 60 countries. The virus has killed more than 3,000 people in around 8 countries. Most of these cases (80,151 infected and 2,943 dead) are from mainland China, the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, according to figures compiled by news agency Reuters.\nIndia has largely escaped the brunt of the outbreak so far. But the three fresh cases reported this week have brought the spotlight on how prepared the country is to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and how the situation stands currently. Here, we recap everything that's happened in India vis-à-vis the coronavirus outbreak. Remember, this information is as of March 3.\nSo far, India has reported six positive cases of coronavirus, or Covid-19. Of these, three were from Kerala and one each from Delhi, Hyderabad and Jaipur. The Kerala cases were reported in February, while the Delhi, Hyderabad and Jaipur infections were confirmed this week.\nThe initial three coronavirus cases in Kerala were comparatively localised compared to what has happened this week. The three new cases have had secondary consequences as authorities rushed to contain any possible spread of the new virus.\nNoida schools shut\nThe private institution also said it was taking preventive steps such as fumigation of the campus and school buses. Separately, another Noida-based school said it would remain shut for the next few days so that it could sanitise its campus as a precautionary step.\nAir India warns fliers\nAir India has essentially asked passengers of the flight to come forward and get themselves screened for symptoms of coronavirus. Meanwhile, the Air India crew that had flown the flight in question is already under quarantine. The ten crew members have been asked to keep themselves under isolation at home and report to doctors if they notice any symptoms of Covid-19.\nSeparately, low-cost carrier IndiGo, which flew the Bengaluru techie on a Dubai-Bengaluru flight, has placed four crew members from the flight under home observation.\nTelangana, Karnataka begin hunt\nOn Tuesday, Telangana's health minister said that all those whom the Bengaluru techie, who's admitted to a Hyderabad hospital, had come in contact with are beign screened. The minister also said that they are collecting information on those who had travelled with the young man from Dubai to Bengaluru.\nThe minister said that more than half the people the techie had contact with have been identified and that both the Telangana and Karnataka governments are taking care of the people at risk.\nAgra on alert\nAgra in Uttar Pradesh is also on alert after links emerged with both the Delhi coronavirus patient and the Italian tourist who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jaipur.\nThe statement added that the six people had come in contact with the Delhi coronavirus patient. News agency PTI, quoting sources, reported that the 45-year-old man had come to Agra to visit his family and that this is how he came in contact with the six people.\nWith fresh cases being reported in India, the government has gone on war-footing to combat the global threat. Among the new measures taken include:\nIndia's first brush with the coronavirus outbreak was a mammoth operation undertaken by the government to rescue and evacuate Indian citizens stuck in China's Wuhan and on a cruise ship anchored off Japan's coast.\nSimultaneously, an Indian Air Force transport aircraft, which flew to Wuhan with emergency medical supplies, rescued another set of Indians from the virus-hit city on its return journey. All the evacuees from China and Japan underwent 14-day quarantines back home. Most of them have been released after testing negative for Covid-19.\nSo, in short: There have been six confirmed cases of coronavirus in India. Three of these -- all from Kerala -- later tested negative and the patients were discharged after treatment. The three new patients -- reported in Delhi, Hyderabad and Jaipur this week -- are under isolation at different hospitals and the government is working on tracking people the patients came in contact with. Globally, coronavirus has infected more than 89,000 people in over 60 countries and has killed more than 3,000 people in around 8 countries as of March 3.\n(With inputs from India Today TV bureaus)\n"

Across the wider Mideast, there are over 1,150 cases of the new coronavirus, the majority of which are linked back to Iran.\nExperts worry Iran\'s percentage of deaths to infections, around 5.5%, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be much higher than current figures show.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi opened the online news conference addressing the outbreak, dismissing an offer of help for Iran by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nIran and the US have seen some of the worst tensions since its 1979 Islamic Revolution in recent months, culminating in the American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and a subsequent Iranian ballistic missile counterattack against U.S. forces.\n"We neither count on such help nor are we ready to accept verbal help," Mousavi said. He added Iran has always been "suspicious" about America\'s intentions and accused the US government of trying to weaken Iranians\' spirits over the outbreak.\nThe British Embassy meanwhile has begun evacuations over the virus.\n"Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain," the British Foreign Office said. "In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited."\nWhile Iran has closed schools and universities to stop the spread of the virus, major Shiite shrines have remained open despite civilian authorities calling for them to be closed.\nThe holy cities of Mashhad and Qom in particular, both home to shrines, have been hard-hit by the virus. Shiites often touch and kiss shrines as a sign of their faith.\nAuthorities have been cleaning the shrines with disinfectants.\nPolice have arrested one man who posted a video showing himself licking the metal enclosing the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, the most-important Shiite saint buried in the country, according to reports by semiofficial news agencies.\nIn the video, the man said he licked the metal to "allow others to visit the shrine with peace of mind."\nMeanwhile Monday, the virus outbreak saw itself dragged into the yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations over a political dispute.\nA prominent columnist at Dubai\'s government-owned Al-Bayan newspaper on Twitter falsely described the virus as being a plot by Qatar to hurt the upcoming Expo 2020 world\'s fair in Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Noura al-Moteari later described the tweet as "satire" to The Associated Press after it gained widespread attention.\nThe Dubai Media Office similarly described the tweet as being written in a "cynical style" while distancing the Arabic-language daily from al-Moteari.\n"Noura is a freelance writer and is not an employee of Al-Bayan nor does she represent the publication\'s views," it told the AP. "That being said, this has no relevance to any social media policy being practiced by the publication nor the state."\nThe tweet comes after Qatar expressed disappointment Sunday that nearly all of its Gulf neighbors snubbed invitations to attend the weekend peace signing ceremony between the US and the Taliban.\n'

French Minister Bruno Le Maire announced that France and the US have agreed to a truce, in which the French tax on the digital economy is deferred to 2022 and Trump freezes the threat of customs duties on Gaulish products. The United Kingdom has announced that a trade agreement with the European Union will be the "first priority", rejecting Trump\'s call for rapid negotiation of an agreement after the Brexit consummated.

'888888,1,The number of deaths due to the novel lung disease in China has risen to 80\'s by Monday around 24. Within a day, the number of confirmed infections with the new Coronavirus in the People\'s Republic climbed even more than 700 to 2744, as state television reported on the Chinese authorities. With around fifty cases outside China, almost 2800 cases have been confirmed worldwide.\nThe number of infected in China may continue to rise sharply as there are around 5800 suspected cases where the diagnosis has not yet been completed. In Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao there are 17 confirmed diseases- in other countries dozens more. As the World Health Organization (WHO) reported, the vast majority of those affected outside China had previously been in the particularly badly affected city of Wuhan in Central China, the starting point of the epidemic.\nIn the USA, two new cases in California and Arizona were confirmed, as reported by the US Health Authority. This increases the number in the USA to five. In one of the new cases, the health department in Orange County, Los Angeles, confirmed that the person had previously returned from a trip to Wuhan.\nThere are also three cases in France, the only country in Europe with confirmed diseases to date, as well as in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal and Australia. Canada counted a first "provisionally confirmed" case.\nOf the patients in China 461 were seriously ill, state television reported. Only in the eleven-million-metropolis of Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei was the condition of other 69 sufferers described as critical. The new virus is probably from a market in Wuhan, where it may have passed from wild animals to humans.\nYeah.\nChina has taken drastic measures to combat the further spread of lung disease. In the province of Hubei, more than 45 million people in at least fourteen cities were largely displaced from the outside world. Flights, train connections and public transport have been stopped. Even metropolises such as Beijing and Shanghai and several provinces have suspended cross-country bus connections to prevent the virus from being introduced.\nThe pathogen has now appeared in almost every province or region of the country. As a further measure against the spread, the Beijing government announced that the generally applicable holidays for workers in the country will be extended by three days, including Sunday, during the current New Year\'s Day.\nIn the Chinese capital, schools, kindergartens and universities remain closed even beyond the planned end of the holiday in mid-February. Several hundred million people have travelled to their home villages over the Chinese New Year Festival, which was held on Saturday night after the traditional lunar calendar.\nMany factories are closed for weeks during the New Year\'s Eve to allow employees to travel home to the most important Chinese family festival. However, it is now feared that the virus may spread further with the expected return wave. Researchers found that infected people are infectious during most ten days of incubation without showing symptoms.\nAccording to the Federal Ministry of Health, the risk of the new Coronavirus for Germany is relatively low. "For all we know, the Coronavirus is difficult to transmit from person to person," said a spokesman for the daily newspaper "The World". "And the course of the disease is relatively moderate."

'888888,0,Just a little snuff? Nothing tastes good anymore? No more air to breathe? Infection with the new Coronavirus is not the same for all humans.\nFor some it feels like a cold, for others it becomes life-threatening or even deadly. The Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) in Berlin explains that general statements about the typical course of the disease are not possible.\nAbout half of the people who have been infected would not even notice, RKI chief Lothar Wieler recently said: "We do not see them at all." Data on the complaints of the identified infected are now available from several countries and increasingly also from Germany. Some of those affected also report themselves on how they are doing with Sars-CoV-2. An overview of the features:\nRather mild events without hospital stay:\nAccording to RKI, four out of five of the infected who notice anything have mild runs. Coughing (54 percent) and fever (40 percent) were among the most common symptoms in Germany, according to data from more than 22.000 patients.\n"It is a rumor that a Sars CoV-2 infection definitely does not cause a flu," says Martin Witzenrath of the Charite Berlin Hospital for Infectiology and Pneumology, where he says more than 20 patients are currently treated with different severe conditions.\nFDP politician Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told the Heidelberg "Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung" that the disease had been wave-like. He had some cold sores for a while, so cough was added. He described the symptoms as "not spectacularYeah.\nAs around 100 people in the particularly affected Heinsberg district of North Rhine-Westphalia have been found in domestic isolation, teams around Bonn virologist Hendrik Streeck have asked: "The most commonly described symptom was dry irritation with 70 percent, before the loss of sense of taste and smell with 68 percent and fatigue with 68 percent,"he says. But many patients also reported "runny nose", headache, muscle and throat pain, and fever. "Some of them were pretty good," says the scientist. Even diarrhoea was not uncommon, Streeck said.\nAccording to World Health Organisation (WHO) data, mild disease progression lasts on average two weeks. According to Streeck, the disease begins after previous experience with neck scrapes or pain and often fever. And with it, like many cold diseases. Is there any indication that Covid-19 can be clearly distinguished? "The only thing that does not cause flu is this loss of taste and smell," says Streeck. Otherwise, in mild cases, "It is like a flu-like infection. Those affected would not have noticed the Sars-CoV-2 infection at all."\nChief physician Clemens Wendtner of the Munich Infectiology Clinic Schwabing, which treated the first infected in Germany at the end of January, also reports, For example, patients could not smell and taste well for several days and felt the taste of food, although their desired dish, as metallic or bitter. According to Wendtner, the impairment may occur at the very beginning and may be the first indication of a disease. Sars, too, was believed to infect scent receptors in the nose.\nHeavy procedures with hospital treatment:\nIt is not known how many people in Germany are hospitalized or have been hospitalized because of Covid-19. In cases of scarcely 56.000 recorded in China, 14 percent was difficulYeah. At six percent, the course was critical to life-threatening, for example due to lung failure. According to the WHO, heavy runs could last between three and six weeks on average.\nIn patients with symptoms of the upper respiratory tract it takes four to eight days to decide whether the disease also affects the lower respiratory tract, says Witzenrath of the Charite. However, there are also patients who get pneumonia directly without first affecting the upper respiratory tract. Inflammatory pulmonary tissue means the oxygen intake is no longer working so well.\nItalian doctors have indicated that there are some patients in the affected country who visit a clinic too late. RKI chief Wieler said on Wednesday, if you feel increasing breathlessness, you should consult a doctor.\nAccording to Witzenrath, the disease picture in Covid-19 differs significantly from the previously known pneumonia. "The special thing about patients is that they sometimes have a bit of a shortage of air, not dramatic, they do not seem particularly ill at all. Then you look at the lung in the CT and it looks really bad. For example, more than half of the lung could have been damaged by the virus. The course could then deteriorate rapidly.\nThe doctor calls the alarm signals: "If you go up a staircase that you otherwise can handle easily, and after half notice that you clearly can\'t breathe, that should be thoughtful. Especially when you are older, you have a history of illness."Relatives could keep an eye on the respiratory frequency of patients: while the patient is lying in front of the TV, for example, one can"best observe"how often the chest is lifting unnoticed. "If the number is quiet over 20 or 22 per minute, this is definitely a warning signa"\nSome Covid-19 patients could be treated at normal stations first, Witzenrath says. "For example, people who are supported by oxygen through a small plastic tube under the nose, and patients whose pre-illness worsens under pneumonia," the physician explains.\nIf patients need more oxygen, a certain oxygen therapy (High Flow) is also used in intensive care. If this is no longer sufficient, breathing through a tube in the trachea is necessary, patients will be put into a coma. "However, complications can occur with the duration of intubation," Witzenrath says. According to the data available so far, it is assumed that those affected must be ventilated in intensive care centres on average 17-day. "This is very, very long."\nAccording to experts, the proportion of patients who need to be ventilated is difficult to say, even because of the dark number of unknown infections. The RKI calls for China: two to six percent. (dpa'
'888888,0,Moscow, 20 March / Sputnik radio. Fernando galliado, a tourism expert, said in a conversation with the Russian news agency, The coronaveros pandemic could revolutionize the tourism sector: people will give up traveling abroad in the medium term, Give priority to internally displaced persons.\nTourism is now paralysed and the borders of Europe, China and Latin America are blocked. "This is a large group of people who will not go anywhere, in the short term," galliado said\nExperts acknowledge that tourism "will collapse", in which case it cannot be moved to any other destination.\nIn this case, no country will win because tourists will not go anywhere. It\'s short-term. In the long run, economic paralysis will affect the whole world. The economic collapse means it will take longer than usual to restore tourism.\nGalliado believes that this situation will first appear in China, but the Chinese do not go to Europe, the United States or Africa, This is also the case in Latin America in another epidemic and in very poor health conditions. "\nIt will be domestic tourism. About\nThis trend will also be acceptable after other countries gradually emerge from the crisis: there will be few overseas tourists around the world.\nGalliado believes that Europe\'s troubles will last until mid May, but that doesn\'t mean people will start travelling immediately. "\nThis means that people start working from now on. Now, many companies in Spain, for example, companies that stop activities, do not fire their employees, but let them go on vacation. In addition, a tax period will begin in April, and people will not be able to pay taxes because they do not have wages.

Yes, travel will be happy, but not happy - meeting other people, "it will take time," he points out.\nCompanies with personal connections will need to review business models and digital technologies.\nI think the hotel will no longer have reception, personal contact, when the staff show their ID card for registration, in theory, he may be infected. For example, checks will be made online - in ", - experts have made it clear.\nTourists\' feelings of the people around them will also change.\n"When people come out of their homes, they don\'t hug each other. They look back carefully first and try to avoid the hotels you often meet." -Quote the example of galliado.\nIt will be more difficult for tourists to return than private apartment owners.\n"Airbus will come out before the hotel.

The new name is still under discussion.

'888888,0,The spread of covid-19 has reversed the habits of life around the world. Experts cannot say for sure when the epidemic begins to decline, especially when it ends. For the international community as a whole, the main hope remains to provide a Colorado virus vaccine.\nAccording to news reports, American modern biotechnology companies have made progress on this issue. It worked with the National Institutes of health to develop a vaccine prototype called mrna-1273. Human drug trials began in Seattle at the Kaiser Permanent Washington Health Research Institute) in Washington state. In addition, inovio pharmaceuticals is developing its drugs, according to the associated press. Its trials are expected to begin in April in the US, China and South Korea.\nExclusive access\nDespite the success of American experts, the Die Welt newspaper reported earlier this week that, U.S. President Donald Tampa\'s government has proposed a large "exclusive license for a possible Colorado virus vaccine from the German company curevac".\nLast week, Daniel menekela, general manager of curevac, was in the White House with representatives of other pharmaceutical companiesAbout The meeting discussed the issue of Colorado virus vaccines and with irregular organizations, vice president Mike Pence and members of the president\'s disease control team. As the company\'s press release points out, meningitis tells U.S. officials that experimental drugs will begin to be ready in the summer.\nAccording to welt, Washington called on cuevac to move its research team to the United States to develop vaccines only for the United States. " The German Ministry of health confirmed the attempt by the US authorities to take over the company.\nThe news caused outrage among German politicians, who asked Berlin to do everything possible to stop Washington\'s plans. "This article is not true," U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Greiner wrote on twitter Another US official said the news was "greatly exaggerated" and rejected the possibility that any public vaccine could only be used in the US. Curevac itself denies any rumours of absorption.\n"All efforts are aimed at developing a Colorado virus vaccine to help and protect people and patients around the world." It was later learned that the activities of cuevac would be funded by the European CommissioAbout\nGlobal efforts\nAfter Chinese experts were able to isolate the genetic code of the virus, countries around the world began to develop vaccines. Researchers from the European Union, the United States, Australia, Israel, China, Japan and Russia are trying to find a way to fight covid-19. About 35 companies and academic institutions are developing drugs. Four of them have started animal experiments. Recently, clinical research has been allowed in China. It has previously been reported that eight new coronavirus vaccines have been developed in the country, some of which have been successfully tested in transgenic mice and mccack.\nThe search for a vaccine itself is a complex and low-level process. It follows the same principle: scientists try to create something similar, but not as dangerous as pathogens. He then contacts the body\'s immune system through vaccination. Ideally, the machine remembers an exciter. Under the influence of the new virus, the human body began to react before the infection. However, some experts fear that this balance could be undermined in a rush to vaccinate. This may lead to the deterioration of the disease. According to Reuters, studies have shown that coronavirus drugs have a development risk of so-called antibody dependent infection aggravating syndrome. About This refers to a process in which the disease does not recede after the use of the vaccine, on the contrary, the disease is aggravating.\nIf it is a sudden outbreak, as now, the vaccine problem is more complicated. The virus may appear and disappear in a few months, with rapid changes in transmission. So while watching countries try to find vaccines at the same time, it\'s more accurately lottery rather than competition. Each team has its own ticket, and whether it will win depends not so much on speed or skill as on the coincidence of success. It\'s worth remembering that the more teams in the game, the greater the chance of success. From a commercial point of view, the development of vaccines is a dangerous undertaking. It\'s important to know that only a few candidates can achieve clinical trials.\nVaccination time\nEven if the drug is now available, it will take at least a year and a half of testing before it can be delivered to ordinary consumers. Who says at least 18 months. Once the vaccine is considered effective, mass production is needed. Most organizations trying to win covid-19 don\'t have the ability at all.\nThese companies intend to support the global innovation alliance to prevent epidemics, CEPIAbout The international organization is ready to invest in vaccine development and increase production at the same time. Recently, she said $2 billion is needed to support drug development. Without that money, the vaccine development program would not be fully implemented, according to Richard Hackett, CEPI\'s executive director.\nHowever, the obstacles are not over. Another challenge is to provide vaccines to all who need them. In general, the epidemic has the greatest impact on the poorest countries. It\'s just that they don\'t have the money to build an effective health care system. This also affects vaccine procurement opportunities. For example, during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the wealthiest countries bought most of their medicines, while the poor countries had nothing. There is another possibility. India, for example, which is a major supplier of vaccines to developing countries, has decided first to use its productive capacity to protect populations under one year of age. Three billion dollars, and then exports drugs to others. This situation can fully explain why the U.S. authorities are willing to get vaccines at all costs.\nIn this regard, who can bring together governments, philanthropic foundations and vaccine manufacturers to agree on a global equitable distribution strategyAbout However, the epidemic is different, in which case no country is obliged to comply with any international regulations. As Jonathan Kwik, a health expert at Duke University in North Carolina, points out, politics and economics are likely to hinder immunization. "\nWilder Smith, a new infectious disease professor at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine, believes the epidemic is likely to peak and fall to its current level. "How to get a vaccine." In this case, drugs can still save many lives, especially if the virus circulates like flu and there are new seasonal outbreaks.\nBut before vaccine production begins, the disease must be controlled as much as possible. Therefore, as long as scientists work in the laboratory, the rest of the best stay at home and wash their hands.\nDmitry beliaye'
'888888,0,Tass, March 24, US scientists prepare the first version of a complete three-dimensional model of the Colorado virus. To do this, they calculated the atomic structure of the shell of a supercomputer. The science center, a science magazine, published a paper.\nThese models will help us understand which parts of the coronavirus play an important role in how to enter human cells. If we discover the secrets of sars-cov-2, scientists will have more opportunities to create new covid-19 drugs. They will also be able to understand how existing drugs work, "said Romeo Amaro, a professor at the University of California, San Diego.\nThe first data for such organisms were received in mid February from Austin, University of Texas, and the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases, When they were able to decipher the precise three-dimensional structure of viral envelope proteins directly involved in cell pollution.\nAmaro points out that an important part of the virus is just a small part of its protein envelope. Scientists have calculated that the single particle sars-cov-2 consists of about two billion atomsAbout So whether it\'s through particle accelerators or supercomputers, viruses are hard to study, They put three-dimensional images of these photos.\nShe added that more problems had arisen because images of all components of the virus package had been obtained in different laboratories and at different resolutions. As a result, scientists spent a lot of time merging data and making the first complete model, ready to compute on the Frontera supercomputer.\nAmaro said the calculations began about two weeks ago. In the near future, scientists plan to get a complete three-dimensional image of the appearance and structure of a single particle. The scientists hope that such images and calculations will help to understand whether there are other ways to introduce the virus into cells than the ACE2 and CD147 receptors.\nRussian federation\nThere are currently more than 396000 AIDS patients registered worldwide. New cases of coronavirus infection (sars-cov-2), more than 17000 people. Dead, more than 103000 recovered Human beings. Outside China, the virus\'s covid-19 disease has been found in 169 countries, including Russia.\nAt present, many countries in the world, including Russia, are developing vaccines for this disease.

'888888,0,Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective. Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as "a game changer." But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?  \n There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host\'s blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums.  \n "Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information centre at Arizona-based Banner Health.

'888888,0,The Chinese doctor who first warned his government of the coronavirus outbreak but had his claims dismissed has now died of the virus.\nLi Wenliang, who had first shared suspicion of a Sars-like illness spreading in Wuhan, died on Thursday after he was infected by the coronavirus, the state-run Global Times reported.\n34-year-old Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at the Wuhan Central Hospital, first told his friends about a viral infection spreading through the district via private messages as early as December 30.\nHe was the first to report about the virus way back in December last year when it first emerged in Wuhan, the provincial capital of China\'s central Hubei province.\nHe had told other doctors through a chat on the Chinese messaging app WeChat that seven patients admitted in his hospital were exhibiting Sars-like symptoms. The ophthalmologist said all seven patients had eaten animal meat from the same seafood market in Hubei.\nLi explained that, according to a test he had seen, the illness was a coronavirus -- a large family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which led to 800 death in China and the world in 2003.\nChina has a troubled history with Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Diseases). A Sars outbreak in 2003 in Southern China had left more than 8,000 people infected and 774 dead over 17 nations.\nLi\'s message was meant to be a cautionary note for his medical school friends to take care of their loved ones. But within hours of Wenliang revealing the information, the chats spread like wildfire on Chinese social media.\nHis name was exposed to hundreds of citizens. "When I saw them circulating online, I realised that it was out of my control and I would probably be punished," Li was quoted as saying by CNN recently.\nAnd that is exactly what happened.\nAUTHORITIES SILENCE NEWS OF OUTBREAK\nOn January 3, Chinese authorities summoned Li and seven other doctors and accused them of spreading rumours. A stern message calling for an end to rumour-mongering was broadcast across China.\n"The police call on all netizens to not fabricate rumours, not spread rumours, not believe rumours," the message read.\nLi was made to sign an affidavit acknowledging his crime and had to promise he will not engage in any such activities in the future.\nBut Li\'s troubles did not end there.\nThe ophthalmologist returned to work soon. While treating a patient affected with coronavirus, the infection was also transmitted to Li. Over the coming days, he showed the same symptoms -- coughing, shortness of breath and fever.\nBy January 12, he was admitted to a hospital. His condition continued to deteriorate and he had to be shifted to the ICU.\nIt was not till January 20 that China would take stock of the spread of coronavirus and declare a national emergency. On the same day, Chinese President Xi Jinping said, "People\'s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed."\nLi\'s diagnosis of coronavirus was only confirmed on February 1. He died five days later.\nTOO MUCH CENSORSHIP LED TO VIRUS OUTBREAK\nA too-harsh crackdown on online rumours during China’s deadly viral epidemic had undermined public trust, China\'s top court said in a highly rare rebuke of the police force.\nSupreme Court Judge Tang Xinghua wrote Wednesday that officers should have been more lenient with those informing of the outbreak.\nIf the public had believed these rumours’ at the time, and carried out measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets it might have been a good thing, he said.\nWuhan police responded in a post on the social media platform Weibo that they had only given education and criticism to the eight and had not meted out harsher punishment such as warnings, fines, or detention.\nBut some users were unhappy with the reply, with one demanding the police apologize and asking: Is it so hard to acknowledge you have done wrong?\nAuthorities in Wuhan have already been criticized online for withholding information about the infection until the end of last year, despite knowing about the new illness weeks earlier.\nOverall 564 people have died in China due to the virus and 28,018 confirmed cases have been reported from 31 provincial-level regions, the National Health Commission reported on Thursday.\n'

The embassy said that it had contacted Yan that night and asked him to call the French emergency number as soon as possible to inform the emergency department. The embassy also reminded Chinese citizens in France that in case of fever and other physical discomfort, they should not go to the hospital for emergency treatment by themselves, but should directly call the emergency number 15.\nFrench health minister Agnes - King, January 23rd, said: "French national new coronavirus Reference Center (which has been tested quickly) will open another fast detection center in Lyon tomorrow. It will take only a few hours to check whether there is any coronavirus infection. If there is a suspected case in France, we can check whether the patient is new in a few hours.

'888888,0,BEIJING (AFP) - It was supposed to be a whirlwind tour of China for Ms Jiang Lanyi\'s boyfriend: classical gardens in Suzhou, modern art in Shanghai, ice-skating in central Beijing. \n Instead, the 24-year-old and her Ukrainian partner have spent more than two weeks holed up in her parents\' house in north-east Liaoning province to avoid the coronavirus. \n Couples around China settled for a quiet Valentine\'s Day this year, with Covid-19 intruding as an unwelcome third-wheel in romantic celebrations. \n The new disease has infected nearly 64,000 people and killed more than 1,350 in China, triggering transport restrictions, restaurant shutdowns, and the closure of major tourist sites. \n Businesses around the country from florists to concert halls closed shop and axed events, leaving couples with no choice but to spend the night in. \n For Ms Jiang and her boyfriend, that meant a lot of mahjong. \n "We play two to three hours every day," said Ms Jiang, who met her partner, a tech entrepreneur, while studying in London. \n "Having started learning from zero, he\'s now very skilled," she added. \n In Beijing, Valentine\'s Day specials aimed at couples - from a My Heart Will Go On\xa0concert to a 1,688 yuan (S$335) lobster dinner for two - were cancelled. \n Valentine\'s Day this year "won\'t be that different from daily life under quarantine," said Ms Tyra Li, who lives in Beijing with her boyfriend of nearly three years. \n Since Lunar New Year, aside from a trip to see family, the couple has only left the house to buy groceries - they don\'t even order food delivery for fear of infection, she said. \n People wearing protective masks walk in a shopping mall decorated for Valentine\'s Day in Beijing, China, on Feb 12, 2020.

"I don\'t dare to receive them and he doesn\'t dare to buy them." \n The risk of infection, which has left most lovers house-bound, has battered Valentine\'s Day sales for businesses hoping to cash in on love. \n Flower shop Xian Hua Ge in Beijing told AFP that sales plunged by up to 70 per cent from last year - partly because many have not returned to the city to work. \n Ms Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a Tuesday (Feb 11) report that the "return rate" of workers for China\'s four Tier-1 cities was only 19.4 per cent as of Feb 9, far below 66.7 per cent a year ago. \n A worker at Romanti Fresh Flowers said sales had dropped up to 50 per cent in part because customers were fearful of virus transmission via delivery staff, while another shop told AFP they had "no stock". \n China\'s wedding industry has also taken a hit, with the Chinese government urging couples to delay their nuptials earlier this month. \n Ms Zhu He, 25, who downsized her wedding due to virus fears last month, said she and her fiance had originally planned to pick up their marriage license on Valentine\'s Day. \n That\'s been delayed due to the epidemic, said Ms Zhu, who lives in southern Guangzhou city. \n "We had planned to go together (with my parents)," she told AFP. "Now, they won\'t come even though we all live in Guangzhou." \n "They both can\'t drive and I don\'t really trust public transport," said Ms Zhu, worried about the risk of infection. \n The coronavirus has also complicated romantic trysts, with many cities across China closing off neighbourhoods to outside visitors in a bid to contain the outbreak. \n Ms Miao Jing, a university student in northern Tianjin city, said her girlfriend had to sneak into her hotel through the car park for a three-hour rendezvous earlier this month. \n The trip was supposed to last three days, explained the 23-year-old, who took a five-hour train to northern Zhangjiakou city to see her partner. \n But on the second day, the district where Ms Miao was staying reported a confirmed case of the virus. "She was really worried," Ms Miao told AFP. "In the end, I only saw her on the first day." \n An empty shopping mall ahead of Valentine\'s Day in Beijing, China, on Feb 12, 2020.

"Even if we cannot be together physically, in some sense we are." \n '

'888888,0,RIYADH (Saudi Arabia) — G20\xa0nations pledged a "united\xa0front" Thursday (March 26) in the fight against\xa0coronavirus, saying they were injecting US$5 trillion (S$7.2 trillion)\xa0into the global economy to counter the pandemic amid forecasts of a deep recession. \n US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin joined the emergency videoconference chaired by Saudi Arabia\'s King Salman, who called for coordinated action while facing pressure to end an oil price war between Riyadh and Moscow that has roiled energy markets. \n The talks come amid criticism that the\xa0G20\xa0has been slow to address the Covid-19 pandemic, which has left more than 21,000 dead worldwide and triggered financial shock waves as more than three billion people are locked down. \n "We are strongly committed to presenting a\xa0united\xa0front against this common threat," the\xa0leaders\xa0said in a joint statement after the\xa0summit. \n "We are injecting over US$5 trillion into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic." \n The figure was a sum total of the fiscal stimulus packages adopted by individual\xa0G20\xa0states, the Chinese foreign ministry said, adding that Beijing\'s share amounted to US$344 billion. \n As concerns mount for poorer countries without access to capital markets or adequate health facilities,\xa0G20\xa0leaders\xa0also pledged to work with bodies such as the International Monetary Fund to deploy a "robust" financial package to support developing nations. \n "It is our responsibility to extend a helping hand to developing countries and (the) least developed countries," King Salman said. \n Putin called for a "moratorium" on sanctions during the pandemic, telling\xa0G20\xa0leaders\xa0it was a matter "of life and death". \n French President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter that "a strong initiative" would be launched to help African nations deal with the\xa0crisis.\xa0 \n He did not specify which countries should be earmarked for sanctions relief. Russia has faced numerous rounds of Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. \n The world\'s 20 most industrialised countries are scrambling to defend their virus-wracked economies amid forecasts they will likely plunge into a recession. \n On Wednesday, the financial ratings agency Moody\'s estimated the\xa0G20\'s overall gross domestic product would contract by 0.5 percent this year, with the US economy shrinking by 2.0 percent and the eurozone by 2.2 percent. \n \'NOT ENOUGH\' \n "The\xa0G20\xa0declaration on the Covid-19 pandemic is a document of global resolve," said Markus Engels, from the Global Solutions Initiative, a network of think tanks. \n "The lesson the\xa0G20\xa0leaders\xa0take away from their meeting should be that social and international solidarity must once again be acknowledged as the most important instrument for combating the\xa0crisis." \n But amid warnings that tens of millions of lives could be lost to the virus globally, international aid agency Oxfam said the\xa0G20\xa0action was "not enough". \n "The world\'s richest governments are still only warming up to the scale of the task," said Chema Vera, Oxfam\'s interim executive director. \n "G20\xa0leaders\xa0must set a truly ambitious plan... to save lives, including a massive injection of funds into public health around the globe." \n This week, Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping pushed for an emergency\xa0G20\xa0summit\xa0to limit the impact of the pandemic. \n The lack of immediate action stood in contrast to the 2008 financial\xa0crisis, when the group quickly swung into action to mobilise assistance for vulnerable countries. \n \'PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO\' \n Talk of global coordination has yet to resonate under Trump\'s isolationist presidency. \n On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took aim at China, saying the top diplomats of the Group of Seven agreed with him that Beijing was waging a "disinformation" campaign about the pandemic. \n At the\xa0G7\xa0talks, a day before the\xa0G20\xa0summit, Pompeo alleged Beijing was engaged in a social media campaign that included conspiracy theories centering on the US being behind the virus, which was first detected in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan.\xa0 \n The\xa0G7\xa0failed to agree on a joint declaration amid Pompeo\'s insistence on labelling the\xa0coronavirus\xa0as the "Wuhan virus", US media reported. \n "The US has provided a perfect example of what not to do as the country pushes its \'US-first\' ideology to the extreme," said Engels. \n Crude oil prices \xa0hammered by the\xa0coronavirus\xa0outbreak\'s impact on demand as well as by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia —\xa0were also expected to be at the centre of the discussions. \n Riyadh faces pressure from Washington to row back on its decision to hike production and offer the biggest price cuts in two decades, in retaliation for Russia\'s refusal to tighten supply as the virus sapped demand. \n On Wednesday, Pompeo urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to "rise to the occasion" and "reassure global energy and financial markets". \n However, the Kremlin said "the oil topic" was off the table.

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — There are now 17 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections from the latest cluster involving a private function at Safra Jurong, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (March 6). \n Of these, nine cases were among the\xa013 new Covid-19 infections\xa0that were reported on Friday\xa0—\xa0the highest number of cases reported in a day so far. \n HOW MANY PEOPLE ATTENDED THE EVENT? \n Speaking to reporters, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the authorities do not yet know the exact number of guests who were present at the dinner function on Feb 15. \n In a statement on Thursday, Safra said that the event was held at the Joy Garden Restaurant on its premises, which was then closed for cleaning from Feb 16 to 19. All visitors had their temperatures checked\xa0and were required to make declarations about their recent travel history, it added. \n “They did not have fever or exhibited any flu-like symptoms. They also did not have any recent travel history to mainland China within the past 14 days of their visit to the club as stated within their declaration,” Safra said. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that investigations are ongoing\xa0to assess how many people attended the dinner\xa0and which people might have\xa0had close contact with individuals who the authorities now know\xa0to have infections. \n WHAT KIND OF EVENT WAS IT?\xa0 \n Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH,\xa0said that the private event was\xa0a sit-down dinner and a social event organised by a couple of individuals for friends and their other family members. \n Assoc Prof Mak said that people were seated at more than one table, and they\xa0were moving around the private function room throughout the dinner. \n WHY DID IT TAKE A WHILE TO FIND\xa0LINKS? \n Not all of the 17 confirmed cases from the cluster at Safra Jurong attended the private dinner function, Assoc Prof Mak said. Some of the infected people linked to the cluster were not present, but were family members of those who had attended the function. \n It took “some time” to establish\xa0how the infected people\xa0in the cluster were linked, he said. \n This came only after extensive recording, investigations of the movements of the infected people and contact tracing. Then\xa0the authorities were able to identify the activity that the confirmed cases had in common —\xa0that is, the private function at Safra Jurong. \n Assoc Prof Mak added\xa0that the authorities had to interview these individuals, trying to find out what their movements were, assessing who they had come into contact with and then\xa0interviewing those other people as well. \n “That takes time. And this explains why it is taking so long to establish the various people involved, to also make a diagnosis on these individuals as well,” he said, adding that contact tracing and investigations are continuing. \n Assoc Prof Mak warned that there is a possibility that more cases linked to this cluster will emerge over the next few days. \n WHY ARE SOME CASES ONLY EMERGING NOW? \n A number of cases from the Safra Jurong cluster presented themselves to the authorities “days after they were\xa0symptomatic”,\xa0Assoc Prof Mak said. \n Some of the infected people continued with social activities and went\xa0to work despite having respiratory symptoms, he added. \n “We’ve always been telling members of the public that if you are sick, please don’t mix around, (don’t) continue with your social activities (or) work activities. If you are sick, see a doctor early and isolate.”\xa0 \n When people do not heed the call to not go out to gatherings when they have flu-symptoms or are sick, it makes it harder\xa0to contain the disease and "exposes other people who otherwise would have been well\xa0to the Covid-19 infection", he said. \n "And this thus makes our task even more challenging in trying to identify who the close contacts might be, and then isolating them and putting them on surveillance.” \n Assoc Prof Lee\xa0emphasised the same point: “It is all a cluster, as a result of someone symptomatic who went for the event. \n “So, as long as people adhere to these social responsibilities and don’t go around when they are ill, then\xa0we can see that this entire incident would not have happened.” \n Asked what had been done to the identified attendees at the private function, Assoc Prof Lee explained that it had been more than 14 days since the event took place, so only those who reported that they were unwell had to go\xa0to the hospital for checks. \n “Those who were well throughout would not have been quarantined because they had already passed that 14-day exposure period,” he said. \n WHO ELSE ARE\xa0LINKED TO THE CLUSTER? \n Aside from the nine newly confirmed cases on Friday, eight other cases reported previously have been linked to the cluster at Safra Jurong. \n They are: Case 96, a Year 1 Raffles Institution student, who is linked to Case 94, a 64-year-old Singaporean woman who is then linked to Case 112, an assistant cook at Creative O Preschoolers’ Bay. None of the cases has recently travelled to China, or Daegu city or Cheongdo county in South Korea. \n Case 107, a 68-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Jakarta, Indonesia from Feb 11 to 14, while Case 117, a 52-year-old\xa0Singaporean woman, was in Malaysia on March 1. \n Other cases linked to the Safra Jurong cluster are Cases 114, 115 and 116 who were confirmed on Thursday. \n WHAT PRECAUTIONS DID\xa0SAFRA JURONG TAKE?\xa0 \n In a\xa0statement on its website\xa0on Thursday, Safra said that the individuals who had attended the private dinner function and who then tested positive for Covid-19 had cleared mandatory temperature checks it had conducted. \n It said that all visitors and employees at Safra Jurong had undergone temperature checks which had been introduced in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, along with other measures such as increased cleaning and disinfection of facilities. \n All visitors have to\xa0make declarations about their travel history\xa0and to provide contact details, the statement added. \n In a Facebook post early on Friday, Safra said\xa0that the restaurant, along with all other possible areas which might have been visited by the affected individuals, was to be “thoroughly cleaned and disinfected again starting (March 6)”. \n In a separate Facebook post, Safra Jurong said that the restaurant will be closed from March 6 to 12. \n '

'888888,0,Articles and official reports on the new coronavirus are full of terms that most of us don\'t use daily. Some of them -- Covid-19, for example -- were coined only after the virus emerged in China. Our simple glossary aims to unclutter this specialised vocabulary and help you better understand your news feed. Is there a coronavirus-related term that you\'d like to see explained but is not on this list? Let us know in the comments section.\nLet\'s begin.\nCoronavirus \nCovid-19\nMortality (or fatality) rate \nThis is the percentage of infected people who die. We still can\'t say with certainty what this number is for the new coronavirus disease, but here are a couple of estimates. On March 3, the World Health Organisation reported a global mortality rate of 3.4%, suggesting the disease is deadlier than the seasonal flu (with a death rate less than 1%). Two past epidemics caused by coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, had much higher mortality rates. (Soon after WHO announced the 3.4 figure, US President Donald Trump raised an eyebrow or two with his "hunch" that it was a "false number".)\nIn February, a study of 44,672 confirmed cases in Mainland China said 2.3 per cent had died. But the rate showed significant variation with age. It was 14.8 per cent for the 80+ category, and just 0.2% for the 10-19, 20-29 and 30-39 groups. It was also higher for men (2.8%) than for women (1.7%).\nPandemic\nPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\nOn January 30, the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern -- an "extraordinary event" posing a "public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease" and potentially needing "a coordinated international response". This doesn\'t happen often: it was only the sixth such declaration made by WHO. When confronted with a PHEIC, a group of experts advises the UN body\'s director-general (currently Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia) on measures to be implemented in the disease-hit country and elsewhere.\nSars-CoV-2\nShort for "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2", this is the name of the new coronavirus.

'888888,0,China has suspended all public transport, including flights in and out of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus as the confirmed cases climbed to 571 mostly from the city with 17 deaths so far.\n\nThe World Health Organization which held an emergency meeting on Wednesday in Vienna to deal with the global impact of the virus has extended the talks till Thursday to decide on whether the outbreak in China constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern , like Ebola and Swine flu.\nSuch a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a coordinated international response in view of fears that millions of Chinese are travelling at home and abroad for the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival holidays starting from January 24.\nIt said its staff in China are closely monitoring the situation.\nThe festival triggers biggest mass migration, clogging road, rail and air networks every year.\nChina\'s Health Commission which is periodically updating the steps being taken to deal with the virus said on Thursday morning that so far a total of 571 confirmed new coronavirus cases and 17 deaths in Chinese mainland.\nMajority of these cases are from Wuhan and surrounding areas.\n\nWhile India has already issued a travel alert, some of the 700 students studying medicine and other courses in around the city still stayed put while majority of them left due to holidays.\nSeven new cases of Wuhan Coronavirus had been confirmed in Shanghai, the Commission said.\nWuhan also suspended bus and subway services in the city and closed outbound travel at train stations and airports from 10am of Jan 23 amid the escalating epidemic of coronavirus, according to a statement released by city authorities early on Thursday.\nThe residents have also been directed to wear masks to ensure that the virus is not spread.\n"We must be steadfast and strong to keep the outbreak within Wuhan\n. We\'ll urge Hubei province and the city of Wuhan to take the strictest measures for prevention and control," Li Bin, vice-minister of the National Health Commission, said on Wednesday.\nSuch measures include intensifying supervision of open-air markets, minimising public activities, taking the strictest measures regarding people with fever and preventing the outbreak from further spreading, he said at a news conference organized by the State Council Information Office.\nThe Wuhan government required all people in public places such as hotels, restaurants, cinemas, parks, shopping centres and public transports to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus, according to an announcement on Wednesday night. The rule took effect immediately.\nOn Wednesday night, Hubei province with capital Wuhan reported 444 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the province alone.\nThe disease further spread across the country as health authorities in Shanxi, Fujian, Gui¬zhou and Hebei provinces, as well as the Ningxia Hui autonomous region, confirmed their first infection cases. Beijing has already reported some cases.\nHong Kong and Macau too have reported such cases.\n"Human-to-human transmission of the disease has appeared, and the virus is likely to mutate. There are risks of the further spread of the disease," Li said, adding the ongoing traffic peak with the upcoming Spring Festival has increased the risk of its spreading, which requires a high state of alert.\n\nChina\'s National Health Commission had received reports of one confirmed case in Japan, one in South Korea and three in Thailand by Tuesday midnight, Li said.\nIn the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed on Tuesday the first case in the country in Seattle.\nGao Fu, head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said there is no evidence so far showing that a super-spreader, or a highly contagious virus, has emerged\n.\nHe added that, based on current evidence, the virus originated from wild animals sold at a seafood market in Wuhan.\nIn Hubei, the provincial government early on Wednesday announced that it had activated its emergency public health response mechanism to effectively prevent the spread of the virus.\nLocal authorities will strictly control the number of outbound activities such as conferences, tours and visits, and large gatherings are banned.\nMeasures will also be taken to prevent the spread of the virus through public transport, and prevent sources of it from entering schools, according to the announcement.\nWuhan authorities announced that all local tourism agencies, including their branches outside the city, will suspend business and will not organize tours until February 8.\nAll tours scheduled to start after January 30 will be cancelled.\nThe city government has also called for residents not to leave Wuhan and outsiders not to enter the city if there\'s no particular need, to reduce the risk of the virus spreading further.\n'
'888888,0,The current Covid-19 pandemic marks an important turning point in increasing confidence and optimism in recent years.\nAt a time when predictions for 2020 were no longer the most optimistic, showing signs of a synchronised global slowdown, Vovid-19 catalysed this reaction, disseminating what appears to have started in a market in China in almost certain and imminent global economic recession.\nIn the midst of the age of artificial intelligence and digitisation, where everything happens very quickly, epidemics also rise to unthinkable rhythms. The special nature of the global world in which we live, where practically no country lives alone, has become the perfect ecosystem for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and trade, production chains, tourism, migration flows or free movement are vectors for transmission.\nEvery time basic principles are at stake, such as health, everything else will have to be pushed into the background. However, the analysis and evaluation of their impact on the economy is of paramount importance.\nAs a result of the spread of this outbreak, various economic impacts are expected. Firstly, the overall impact of the collapse of the Chinese economy, at least in the first quarters of this year. Then the supply-side shock, resulting from the failures in production chains and absenteeism (the productivity of teleworking will have to be assessed after this situation we are living in). However, due account must also be taken of the decrease in demand, the result of greater uncertainty and the postponement of investment decisions. And finally, the expected impact on company liquiditYeah.\nFrom a macroeconomic point of view, despite some recent improvements, Portugal still has serious susceptibility, as the Economists have reiterated both through its Quarterly Fiscality Barometer, in the various public interventions and in the think-tank Mission Growth.\nOur country has the third largest debt in Europe as a percentage of the GDP (119,5%), the weight of interest being the second highest in the European Union, implying excessive exposure to external risks.\nIn addition, the sustainability of public accounts depends on a high tax burden on businesses and households, which will see their income decrease as a result of automatic stabilisers linked to the decrease in economic activity.\nOn the contrary, it is expected that public expenditure, with its rigid character, will be increased by increasing (more than necessary, in this period) expenditure on health, by providing additional social benefits or by measures to promote the economy.\nOf course, the forecasts in the OE/2020 no longer make sense in the light of the current climate. Growth targets, debt reduction, maintaining low unemployment rates, stability of funding rates or the long awaited and celebrated budget surplus will certainly not meet expectations.\nThis is the most obvious demonstration of the greatest risk resulting from the failure to implement important long-identified but always delayed structural reforms, even at a time when threats were already visible (the trade war between China and the US, geopolitical tensions, the Brexit or the situation of the Italian financial system). The country is therefore more exposed to external shocks, and now the unexpected Covid-19 pandemiYeah.\nThis virus, the so-called black swan, in addition to the serious and numerous impacts on health, has already resulted in the largest stock-market crash ever of the PSI-20 in this century, an oil war involving Russia and Saudi Arabia and the increasing closure of borders by various states. With regard to economic impact, the OECD has already revised world growth from 2,9% to 2,4% being the most pessimistic scenario of 1,5% at European level, and the European Commission estimated an impact of 2,5 percentage points against the initial estimate of growth(1,4% of GDP), setting the new estimate in a possible 1%of GDP recession.\nGiven all this, what can be done to mitigate this economic impact? The answer will have to be given in a concerted way and at European level, and much more proactivity is needed, as well as a strengthening of debt purchasing programmes, ensuring that the debt risk of the southern countries does not rise and that the new debt that is generated at European level is mutualised. The U.E. cannot fail and has an opportunity to show that its ability to resolve a situation like this exists and will be exercised successfully.\nOn the business side, fiscal and credit payments need to be made more flexible in order to avoid the insolvency of companies due to lack of liquidity, as well as the launch of investment support programmes and the minimisation of costs generated by Covid-19.\nOn the side of households, support should be provided beyond what has already been announced, for cases with more dependents and less income, as well as greater flexibility in payment of loans for housing, electricity and water.\nThe times we are living in are difficult for everyone. Also for the political decision-makers in the various countries affected by this pandemic. But we can overcome them, working together and in tuneYeah. After all, epidemics have a cyclical character and the history of mankind shows us that. And in the end, we have to face the strangeness of the present that we are living with the possible normality, let alone to remind us of the lesson that swans are not always white.\n*Staff of the Order of Economist'

'888888,0,The coronavirus outbreak disrupted Islamic worship in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia on Wednesday banned its citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca, while Iran canceled Friday prayers in major cities.\nThe decisions in Riyadh and Tehran affected both Sunni and Shiite Muslims alike.\nThe Saudi move expands a ban last week on foreigners visiting Mecca and Medina, home to the holiest sites in Islam. That decision alone disrupted travel for thousands of Muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affects plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage.\nEven after that announcement on Feb. 27, people already in Saudi Arabia could still travel to Mecca\'s Grand Mosque, where pilgrims circle the black, cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims around the world pray toward five times a day. The crowds were far smaller crowds than usual before Wednesday\'s statement from an unidentified Interior Ministry official that was carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.\nMillions attend the annual hajj, which this year is set for late July into early August, and many more visit the kingdom’s holy sites year round. Those other pilgrimages are referred to as the umrah, which drew 7.5 million foreigners in 2019 alone.\nIt remains unclear how the ban will be enforced. The government described the suspension as temporary, but gave no hint at when it will be lifted. The ban also appeared to encompass the Prophet Muhammad\'s Mosque in nearby Medina.\nThe decision seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic and prevent its access to the Two Holy Mosques, which are witnessing a permanent and intense flow of human crowds, which makes the issue of securing these crowds of utmost importance," the Saudi government said.\nIn Iran, authorities halted Friday prayers in all provincial capitals amid the country\'s growing coronavirus outbreak, which has killed at least 92 people amid 2,922 confirmed cases. Iran and Italy have the world\'s highest death tolls outside of China.\nThis disease is a widespread one, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told his Cabinet, according to a transcript. It encompasses almost all of our provinces and is, in a sense, a global disease that many countries in the world have become infected with, and we must work together to tackle this problem as quickly as possible.\nThe announcement came a week after a similar order affected Tehran and several other major cities.\nWhile observant Muslims can pray at home, the devout prefer to attend Friday prayers as a community. Iran\'s Shiite theocracy also use the services to share ideological messages by clergymen selected by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nThere are now over 3,150 cases of the virus across the Mideast. Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic.\nTop leaders in Iran\'s civilian government and Shiite theocracy have become infected with the virus. The country stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 90,000 people and caused over 3,100 deaths.\nExperts continue to worry that Iran may be underreporting its cases.\nThe spread of the virus to almost all of Iran’s provinces leave little doubt that the authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak, wrote Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at the risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. After a slow and politicized response to the outbreak, the government now faces a race against time to prevent a public health emergency from turning into an economic crisis."\nAuthorities in Iran said they arrested a man for posting a video online of bodies wrapped in white shrouds and zipped into black body bags at a cemetery in Qom on Monday.\nThe video purports to show over 30 corpses waiting to be washed per Islamic tradition, with a man\'s voice alleging all were corona-infected.\nAli Ramezani, the executive manager of the Qom cemetery, later told state television that authorities were awaiting the outcome of coronavirus tests on them before they were prepared for burial. Bodies testing positive are buried by staff wearing gloves and protective gear, and the graves are lined with lime.\nIf the test results are negative, then there is no need to bury them based on the protocol for the new coronavirus and the family can receive the body of their loved ones and bury it where they want, Ramezani said.\nEshaq Jahangiri, Iran\'s senior vice president, meanwhile banned all overseas trips for officials to attend international events, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported. That did not affect Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh, who traveled with an entourage to Vienna for an OPEC meeting.\nRouhani, in his Cabinet meeting, acknowledged the toll the outbreak was taking on the public. He called on state television to offer happier programs to entertain those stuck at home.\nI urge all artists, scientists, psychologists and all who can bring smiles to people’s faces, come into the social media, he said. Today, words that make people tired are no longer advantageous.\nHis request came as Iran\'s judiciary ordered Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof, who just won the Berlin Film Festival\'s Golden Bear, to serve a one-year prison sentence over his movies.\nIn Israel, Chief Rabbi David Lau urged observant Jews to refrain from kissing the mezuzah, a small item encasing a prayer scroll that is attached to doorposts. Observant Jews typically touch the item and then kiss their hands when walking through a doorway.\nOfficials in Iraq\'s semi-autonomous Kurdish region said they suspected a 70-year-old man living near the border with Iran died of the coronavirus. He would be Iraq\'s first death from the virus, although authorities in Baghdad had not confirmed his infection.\nThe United Arab Emirates helped evacuate Sudanese students stuck in the hard-hit Chinese city of Wuhan. They\'ll be held in the UAE in quarantine. And Egypt banned Qataris from entering the country following Doha starting a similar ban.\n'
'888888,0,SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Years ago, when Randy Tinseth was still running Boeing’s sales account for United Airlines, the plane company’s designers pulled him aside.\n“They called me in and said we want to show United this interesting product and we can’t tell you about it until we get there,” Tinseth recalled. “We get to United and this dented silver case comes off the conveyer belt for bags and ... I don’t even know what is in it.”\nOut came the model of a futuristic, high-speed airliner called Sonic Cruiser.\nBut the plane never made it off the ground, as airlines in the early 2000s put more emphasis on efficiency than speed. The company quickly shifted to the high-tech but more conventional 787 Dreamliner - so quickly that rival Airbus suggested the Sonic Cruiser was just a bluff.\nTinseth, who recently told colleagues he plans to retire after 38 years at Boeing, said he had plenty of such stories about rollercoaster bets in an often-volatile industry.\n“I remember it was a couple years of talking about (the Sonic Cruiser) and then it turned into the 7E7 and the 787,” Tinseth said at the Singapore Airshow.\nThe 60-year-old Montana-born engineer has attended dozens of shows as one of the industry’s most influential forecasters. This week’s expo, thinly attended because of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus fears, is his last before stepping down as Boeing’s vice president of marketing.\n“In two days, you can get a sense of what is going on more than you ever could. This show is really about the virus without question, and it is about the MAX for us,” he said, referring to the 11-month-old grounding of Boeing’s best-selling model.\nEighteen years after the ambitious Sonic Cruiser project died, and in the midst of a crisis over the 737 MAX, which was involved in two high-profile fatal crashes, Boeing has shelved another mid-sized jet project for further study.\nWhatever decisions Boeing takes now on mid-sized jets will shape its eventual path out of the MAX crisis, analysts say. So far, it has said abandoning the MAX and building a direct replacement is not an option.\nTinseth declined to be drawn into a discussion on the mid-sized airliner situation. “The dynamic has changed. I’ll leave it at that,” he said.\nBut he sees the trend towards lighter, nimble jets started by the 787 continuing. Such aircraft allow airlines to start new routes unavailable to thirstier, larger planes.\nAnd it is a trend that has paid off for Boeing, which sold 1,485 Dreamliners. But lately it has been on the losing side of the same battle, as airlines rushed to buy the smaller Airbus A321XLR.\nTinseth began his career as a flight-test engineer on the aircraft the A321XLR and the potential Boeing mid-sized jet both aim to replace: the Boeing 757. With long wings and sporty engines, the out-of-production airliner remains his favourite Boeing model.\n“When it takes off you feel the performance in the back of your neck,” he said.\nHe said his favourite aircraft by a competitor was Airbus’ strong-selling A350-900. But as usual in the jet marketing war, there was a sting in the tail.\n“I think we have got a huge advantage, but it’s a good airplane, unless you are under 5 feet tall and can’t reach the bins,” Tinseth joked. Airbus says its A350 overhead bins are among the largest.\nTinseth said curbing emissions would be the industry’s main challenge of this century.\n“There are innovations that I don’t know yet, but we will find a way as an industry to innovate to address that problem,” he said.\nHe poo-poohed as an old idea a “blended-wing body” airliner design Airbus presented this week, which Airbus says will greatly increase efficiency and reduce emissions.\nThe Singapore Airshow this week included a rare appearance of both U.S. and Chinese fighter aerial demonstrations at the same event. Combined with the coronavirus fears, it was a surreal atmosphere for many.\n“It is kind of strange to go out on such a strange show but at the same time, it still probably makes this special,” Tinseth said. “I watched those airplanes flying today, the boom and the vroom.”\n'

'888888,0,The world is in the midst of emergency caused by pneumonia. And no, I not just talk about the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China. While public health authorities are struggling to contain the dangerous viral agent of SARS -nCoV2019 type, as is known-, childhood pneumonia is today the most infectious murderer of children, claiming a life every 39 seconds. Nevertheless, the international community has responded to this emergency with little more than a collective shrug.\nPerhaps this is because most people think that pneumonia is primarily a threat to the elderly, which is true. Coronavirus, which kills through severe acute respiratory infection and has reinforced this perception. Most of the victims were elderly with preexisting health conditions. However, pneumonia is today the leading cause of infectious death in children and claims more than 800,000 lives a year. Most victims are under the age of 2 years. Most deaths occur in the poorest countries of the world.\nThere are no statistics that can capture the human tragedy that is at the center of the emergency. Caused by bacteria, fungi or viral agents this is a disease that attacks the air sacs of the lungs, causing it to swell and fill with pus. Children are literally struggling to breathe.\nThe good news is that childhood pneumonia can be overcome. Effective pneumococcal vaccines (PCVs) can prevent non-viral cases and Gavi (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) has funded the vaccination of more than 120 million children. With early and accurate diagnosis by a health worker, most cases can be treated successfully with basic antibiotics that cost less than 45 cents. Even the most severe cases can be treated with antibiotics highest level and medical oxygen. In recent research conducted in hospitals in Nigeria has been found that a combination of medical oxygen and a diagnostic instrument called pulse oximeter, which measures oxygen levels in the blood, can reduce the death rate in half.\nNow the bad news. Although childhood pneumonia deaths are declining, more slowly than those of other great murderers such as malaria and measles. Five years ago, governments signed the commitment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of "ending preventable child deaths" by 2030. If current trends continue, pneumonia turn that promise into (another) promise unfulfilled, which it will further weaken the credibility, already fragile, governments, donors and international agencies comply with the ODS.\nSo why is the biggest murderer of children the world generates so little action and international cooperation? As I discussed in another space Devi Sridhar -Professor global public health at the University of Edinburgh-the victim profile it is part of the explanation.\nWith malnutrition as the main risk factor, pneumonia is the final illness of poverty. Those who face the greatest risks -the poor rural and slum dwellers urbanos- no voice in the priorities of the health agenda. And although the poorest children face the greatest risks are the least likely to be immunized, the last in the list of treatment and those most at risk of receiving an inaccurate diagnosis.\nPneumonia can check (in) equity health systems. When symptoms of the disease appear, the poorest households often delay treatment because of concerns about their cost, or because the nearest clinic is far away. In many cases, the clinics lack the trained personnel and diagnostic equipment they need to provide effective treatment.\nThere are some encouraging signs that suggest that inertia is giving way to action. This governments, donors, researchers, UN agencies and civil society organizations meet in Barcelona week in the first World Forum on Child Pneumonia. The goal is to share evidence and, more importantly, give impetus to control strategies pneumonia and action plans to turn that evidence into policies that save lives. They are emerging alliances for change, led by the Every Breath Counts Coalition (Every Breath account).\nOne of the barriers to effective action against pneumonia has been increasingly anachronistic debate between advocates of "vertical" or specific for the disease, and approaches "horizontal" aimed at strengthening health systems interventions. Substantive issues at stake are real. Too often, donors pronounced horizontal speech, emphasizing its commitment to strengthening health systems, but then loaded resources disease-specific interventions that distort health priorities. While the World Bank extols the virtues of strengthening health systems, their funds largely diverted resources into vertical interventions.\nIn the same way health systems must respond to diseases that endanger the poor. The idea that countries can move towards the holy grail of Universal Health Coverage without addressing diseases such as pneumonia, without breaking the link between malnutrition and broader health risks, is a fiction. The entry point for effective action is the primary health care and support for community health workers. Health systems that divert resources to higher-level facilities outside the reach of the poor, never become more than just a trickle effect.\nThe coronavirus has provided a painful but timely reminder that we are members of one human community. In our interconnected world, a health epidemic that starts in Wuhan can, in a few weeks, pose threats to health from Bombay to New York. Multilateralism and international cooperation are our only defense.\nBut the argument in favor of multilateral action does not stop with the epidemics that cross borders and affect the public in rich countries. Today, pneumonia kill more than 2,000 children. That is a health emergency, and is one that can stop.\nKevin Watkins is CEO of Save the Children UK.

'888888,0,BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China is rushing a flurry of patient studies to identify the most effective life-saving treatments for people sickened by the coronavirus. \n Some 77 clinical trials targeting the pneumonia-causing virus have been registered in China since Jan 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \n The disease, known as Covid-19, has infected at least 48,000 people, killing more than 1,300, mostly in China, since it emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019 and spread to two dozen countries. \n The trials range from the high-profile study of Gilead Sciences Inc\'s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir and AbbVie Inc\'s HIV pill Kaletra, to tests of traditional Chinese herbal medicines and whether the sport of shadowboxing may aid recovery. \n While the sheer size of the research effort is noteworthy, the ability to scientifically and methodically discern ways to treat and prevent infections caused by a pathogen in the middle of an outbreak is unprecedented. \n "The role that research can play is often very contentious, whether we need to respond to an outbreak or whether we can actually take the time to research interventions," said Dr Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. "It\'s really important for us to be able to do both. \n "The pace of research can keep up sometimes and really needs to be not an afterthought, because we don\'t know how long some of these new emerging infections will persist," she said, noting that scientific accuracy and research quality remain critical. \n Much of the research effort has been guided by the World Health Organisation\'s R&D Blueprint that enables the rapid activation of research studies during epidemics. \n Chinese regulators have been streamlining bureaucracies to cut the time it takes to approve drug trials and win approvals, ensuring that patients can get cutting-edge medicines fast and, in some cases, even before patients in developed countries. \n "Optimistically, some of the trials could have an early readout in three to four weeks," said Dr Ding Sheng, dean of Tsinghua University\'s School of Pharmaceutical Sciences. If trials meet their key objectives, "conditional approval could be considered, given the current outbreak situation", he said. \n Some studies, including the one testing remdesivir, require regulatory approval from the National Medical Products Administration, while others are initiated by doctors and can proceed after hospital ethics committees have given their consent. \n It is important to start studies while the virus is circulating widely so researchers can determine relatively quickly which medicines are most effective. \n The large number of patients being diagnosed means that studies may be conducted fast, with full enrollment of antiviral drug trials occurring in just six months, said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO\'s chief scientist. \n Efforts to develop drugs for Ebola and the coronaviruses that caused Sars and Mers ran into difficulty because of waning cases. Complicating the process is the potential that an outbreak may abate before a vaccine or treatment is ready for use, diminishing its value. \n Gilead\'s experimental drug remdesivir, which was developed to fight Ebola, but has shown some signs of potency against Sars and Mers, is being tested at a hospital in Wuhan after a coronavirus patient getting it in the US appeared to respond. \n Some 761 patients are expected to be enrolled in the trial, 66 per cent of whom will be dosed with the drug. The remainder will receive standard treatment and placebo, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. \n While the drug\'s effectiveness against the new coronavirus is still being investigated, scientists in China who tested it in labs filed an application to patent its use against the coronavirus as early as Jan 21. The move was seen as an effort by China to gain some bargaining power as it negotiates licence fees with Gilead in the event that clinical trials prove remdesivir works in patients. \n China\'s National Health Commission recommends AbbVie\'s Kaletra be used as part of antiviral treatment for Covid-19 cases even while it plans to study the efficacy of the HIV medicine alongside antivirals such as Roche Holding AG\'s Xofluza, and Avigan, an anti-influenza medication developed by Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Toyama Chemical Co. \n Traditional Chinese remedies are also being explored for their virus-fighting potential. \n Guangdong Province Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital is conducting observational studies to check the efficacy of two different concoctions of Chinese herbal medicines: one for infected patients and the other for those suspected of having the infection, said Dr Liu Yuntao, who applied to conduct the trials. Further studies may be done if they appear to be effective, she said. \n It\'s important to ensure clinical studies are of high quality and generate meaningful results, WHO\'s Dr Swaminathan said. \n "As long as the studies are done well, well-designed to give the right answer, there may be products which can be tested as adjunct therapies, for example, along with anti-retrovirals," she said. "I would like to see that they\'re tested in good clinical trial protocols." \n Guangdong\'s drug regulator approved the use of an herbal medicine, dubbed "Pneumonia Formula 1", across 30 hospitals. It was designated for treating pneumonia caused by the virus after more than half of the 50 patients who took it said symptoms such as coughing, throat pain and weakness resolved, and all of them no longer had fever, state media reported. \n '
'888888,0,LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That’s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country’s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China’s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world’s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels\n.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters’ favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China’s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed\n. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n'

In order to decide this, a body of the World Health Organisation had to\nWHO today ask the following questions:\nLike most experts, the WHO body was of the opinion that:\nthat all these questions must be answered with yes and called the emergency\nOff. The amazing thing is that the decision to the panel everything else\nas lightweight. It was only in the second beginning and after long discussions that the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, decided to do so. Why the hesitation? Why did the decision become such a policy, and what does this emergency actually mean?\nFirst of all, to clear up a misunderstanding:\nThe WHO decision is not a risk assessment. That the WHO now\nCauses a health emergency, not because it causes the new corona virus\nConsiders it more dangerous than at 22nd. January, when the first emergency meeting took place.\nThe new Coronavirus has been a source of concern to scientists and researchers from the outset. Since the 13th.

She advises\nnot as usual the countries concerned, but begins to\nMeasures to coordinate\nYeah. "Competences to the WHO and\nMaike Voss, who works at the Foundation Science and Politics on Global Health Issues, explains.\n2005 196 States have agreed on International Health Regulations (IHR). Since then, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for five international health emergencies (PHEIC):\nFor example, when an emergency has been declared, countries must justify what they are doing in terms of health.\ntuna. China could now within\n48-hours must explain why it is useful for the health of the population,\nTo quarantine entire cities. The same applies when countries border\nclose or stop trading. This is also the idea behind the international health emergency to ensure that food\nor medicines continue to come to affected places.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals\nYeah. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals\nYeah.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nAlthough the declaration of a health emergency is not a miracle weapon, medical lawyers write in an article published today (Jama: Phelan et al., 2020). It was a "strong signal to the international community". The WHO Director-General and many experts hope that countries with weaker health systems will also benefit if the corona virus arrives.\nIn addition, the emergency room is also an operation\nto the sovereignty of a state and thus always a policy. In the case of\nCoronavirus 2019-nCoV in China is even highly political. China has tried to make the world\nmassive containment measures to show that it is in control of the emergency\nMaike Voss said: "Health protection is always a sign\nChina wanted to show the world that there was no\nNeed help. At a time when it is in a trade conflict with the United States and\nthe new Silk Road Initiative its economic power worldwide\nshows it does not want to show weakness\nYeah.\nThere is something else: in the past\nhealth emergencies often caused in situations where the\nThere is a need for money and help in areas and countries, such as democratic\nRepublic of Congo in the fight against Ebola.

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — Like many others on the frontline during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Chua\xa0Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment — N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns — was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves.\xa0 \n Speaking to TODAY, Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus.\xa0 \n By the time Sars was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan’s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for Sars patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore.\xa0 \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added.\xa0 \n “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” \n “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus — or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus — was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic\n.\xa0 \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus — which has spread to several countries — as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31).\xa0 \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals.\xa0 \n As of noon on Friday, there were 16 confirmed cases with the virus here, 35 cases were still waiting for their test results and 198 had already tested negative.\xa0There are no deaths in Singapore thus far. \n At the heart of the city-state’s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after Sars and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009.\xa0 \n  Medical workers conduct routine checks to guests\xa0before the start of an NKF show at a Mediacorp studio as a safety precaution against SARS in 2003. TODAY file photo \n “After Sars, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.\xa0 \n “I think we are much better prepared now.”\xa0 \n Currently, Singapore is at Dors condition (Dorscon) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is Dorscon Orange, which would have applied in the case of Sars, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested — since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and Sars veterans told TODAY\n.\xa0 \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from Sars are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during\xa0Sars, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory — Sars and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating Sars patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n Sars first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in\xa0a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital.\xa0 \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on March 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  Church goers being screened for their body temperature by the thermal imaging system at\xa0New Creation Church before attending prayers in 2003.

Photos: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH.\xa0 \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to Sars, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers told TODAY that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in Sars and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body.\xa0 \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient — a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan — tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore\n. \n “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are\xa0already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when Sars caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Adviser: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat \n Mr S Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information \n Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry \n Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources \n Mr Ng Chee Meng, Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress \n Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education \n Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs \n Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development \n Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Transport, Communications and Information \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said\n.\xa0 \n “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture — you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added. \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore\xa0is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the Sars outbreak in 2003, where it was — in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang —“flying blind”.\xa0 \n During the Sars crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing Sars as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the Sars crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. Sars was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans.\xa0 \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with Sars,” she added.\xa0 \n  Tan Tock Seng Hospital\'s\xa0moderate risk area during the 2003 Sars period. TODAY file photo \n   Notices at Tan Tock Seng Hospital informing visitors and patients of the Wuhan coronavirus\n. Photos: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During Sars, TTSH was known as “Sars Central”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient — who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH — created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH.\xa0 \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003.\xa0 \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during Sars, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis.\xa0 \n “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff\n. Everything is in place today,” he said. \n Visitors, staff and patients entering Gleneagles Hospital will have to undergo a screening at the entrance. Photo: Justin Ong/TODAY \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks\xa0to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours.\xa0 \n Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” \n SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too — student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  Nanyang Technological University\'s Graduate Hall 1, which is designated as a quarantine facility\n. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than Sars given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added.\xa0 \n Unlike Sars, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and Sars. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva.\xa0 \n Prof Pangestu told TODAY that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  With the evolving Wuhan coronavirus situation, people are taking precautions to prevent the spreading of germs by wearing masks\n. Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities.\xa0 \n “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available — robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu.\xa0 \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Underreaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to underreaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it — this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”.\xa0 \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting\xa0because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday\n. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS\xa0 \n Although the memory of Sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.\xa0 \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour. \xa0 But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the Sars legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another Sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”.\xa0 \n  Surgical masks sold out at Guardian Pharmacy at Changi Airport on Jan 29, 2020.\xa0Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n In a viral outbreak, being\xa0 “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said.\xa0 \n This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all… There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong. \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n “During Sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone\n. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening… But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during Sars, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” \n STRONGER LEGISLATION\xa0 \n Compared with the Sars crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour — the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again\n. The issue became such a problem during the Sars crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined.\xa0 \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: "While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so." \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS\xa0 \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  \u200bPreschool children getting their health checked by teachers at My First Skool at Buangkok Crescent on Jan 28, 2020.\xa0Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.”\xa0 \n This will be critical during the “surge response”— when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said\n. They noted how in Hong Kong, protestors bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters — mostly residents — also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication.\xa0 \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times,\xa0"All the right moves for Sars but info’s a bit slow, no?",\xa0by its then\xa0news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have Sars. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the Sars suspect list. \n “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about Sars in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information — and accurate information — is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,” he said.\n'
'888888,0,KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 6\xa0-- The temporary travel\xa0ban on Chinese nationals arriving from Hubei province and the city of Wuhan will\xa0be\xa0extended to all other provinces placed under lockdown by the Chinese government in the wake of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection.\xa0“The Immigration Department will also from now\xa0impose a travel ban\xa0on a province as soon as the Chinese government declares it under lockdown,” Deputy Prime Minister\xa0Datuk\xa0Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said in a statement tonight.\xa0Dr Wan Azizah, who is also\xa0National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) chairman, said Malaysia’s border security will also be tightened by adding more thermal scanners and laboratory facilities to quicken test samples results.\xa0Besides government hospitals, she said the Health Ministry will provide additional\xa02019-nCOV diagnostic testing\xa0facilities, including roping the services of private health laboratories,\xa0to complement the existing 18, comprising the Institute for Medical Research (IMR), National Public Health Laboratory (MKAK), four state public health laboratories and 12 hospital\xa0laboratories nationwide.\xa0Dr Wan Azizah, who chaired a special meeting on the coronavirus infection in Putrajaya this evening, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also making arrangements for the urgent return of 212 embassy/consulate general offices non-essential staff in China.On arrival at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), she said they would be taken to a health checkpoint to undergo screening including clinical sampling.\xa0“Those with symptoms will immediately be taken to the hospital while those without will be allowed to return home and put under home surveillance for up to 14 days"They are required to immediately report to a nearby clinic or hospital if they have symptoms such as cough, cold, fever, shortness of breath or other health problems," she said.She said as at 8pm today 10 people (two families) who are non-essential\xa0staff from Guangzhou arrived at KLIA and were taken to a health checkpoint to undergo medical\xa0screening.She said they were allowed to return home and placed under home surveillance.Dr Wan Azizah said the government was prepared to assist the 34 Malaysians in Wuhan who could not return to the country with the 107 who were brought home on Feb 4.She said at present, they cannot leave the Hubei province following the travel ban imposed by the Chinese government.Meanwhile, Dr Wan Azizah\xa0said programmes and official activities in public places can still be held unless the organisers cancel them.To date,\xa027,636 coronavirus cases have been recorded across the globe with 564 deaths.In Malaysia, 14 cases have been tested positive.-- BERNAMA\xa0\xa0\r\n\xa0'
'888888,0,By R. ThivyamaliniKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 29\xa0-- The handling of patient’s associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus infection in the country is being carried out with the utmost care,\xa0with their treatment beginning as soon as the patient is suspected to be infected with the virus.Dr\xa0Yasmin Mohamed Gani, Infectious Disease Consultant\xa0at Sungai Buloh Hospital,\xa0said the isolation process for suspected patients would begin early and they would not be placed in public wards.“Once we (the health practitioners) have patients with coronavirus, we will quarantine and isolate them. We will stop placing them in the isolation ward if they test negative for the virus and\xa0have fully recovered.“Usually, the results of the detection test sent to the\xa0Institute of Medical Research\xa0will be known within 24 hours, and if the test is confirmed\xa0positive we will continue isolating and closely monitoring the patient,” she said when contacted by Bernama today.Known as 2019-nCoV, the coronavirus that causes respiratory illnesses\xa0such as pneumonia, was first detected in December in Wuhan, China, with symptoms of infection including fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.Dr Yasmin said staff caring for coronavirus patients\xa0were also\xa0experienced in dealing with infectious diseases.“We have a highly trained dedicated team who will take care of the patients.\xa0They (doctor/nurse) will go in pairs (for monitoring) minimum twice a day.“Why in pairs? So they can monitor each other to avoid any treatment errors and so on. Outside (the room) there will also be someone who will take care to make sure the two are not facing any problems,” she said.She said patients’\xa0dietary practices were based on hospital diets\xa0while their food utensils comprise single-use disposable\xa0plates and cutlery to prevent the spread of the virus.On how to detect for coronavirus, she said it would be done through sputum examination while for patients with no phlegm, the doctor will conduct a swab examination through\xa0the inner nose.\xa0“Every handling of the specimen is carried out with the utmost responsibility and it will be placed in a triple packaging to prevent the spread of the virus,”\xa0she said.So far, seven people, all Chinese nationals,\xa0have tested positive for coronavirus in the country.Dr Yasmin said three individuals who reported positive early this morning were in a stable condition and being monitored.Meanwhile, on prevention measures to be taken, Dr Yasmin recommended that personal hygiene be maintained at all times.“Always wash your hands, avoid rubbing your face and eyes without washing your hands. Also avoid contact with wild animals, and it is safe to wear face mask.“Those who have a sore throat, cough or other symptoms are advised to see a doctor as soon as possible,”\xa0she said.-- BERNAMA'
'888888,0,SINGAPORE - All public hospital emergency departments here are on "outbreak response mode" as Singapore raises its defences against a mysterious virus that is spreading in China. \n "We cannot rule out the possibility that the new (Wuhan) virus will reach Singapore," Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), told The Straits Times. The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspected patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative-pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has "high-end" Hepa filters in 124 negative-pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human\n. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n A negative-pressure isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n The negative-pressure ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the bug, currently called the 2019-nCoV. \n Prof Leo said that it is not yet known whether this virus is as dangerous as Sars. \n But Singapore is not taking chances. All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE).\xa0Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air-purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. \n Prof Leo said Singapore has a stockpile of the disposable PPE as well as the powered air-purifying respirators - enough to supply all hospitals, should a major outbreak occur here. "Yes it is expensive, but protection of staff is the most important thing," said Prof Leo, a veteran of the Sars outbreak in 2003, when medical staff caring for infected patients were among the 238 people infected and the 33 who died. \n The 330-bed NCID, which opened slightly over a year ago, has more than 100 "surge beds", which are kept empty and on standby for national emergencies. \n All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE).\xa0Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air-purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Although the flu vaccine does not protect against the Wuhan bug, she said it is a good idea to get vaccinated. On a national level, it will "cut down on the background noise"\n. \n She added that should there be a positive case of the Wuhan bug here, people will be told. \n "We need to be able to share the information and be able to guide the public, as well as the entire public healthcare system, to be able to handle the situation," she said. \n WIDER DEFINITION \n Singapore\'s Ministry of Health has widened its definition of suspect cases, and it will now include anyone with pneumonia who had been to China - not just Wuhan - within 14 days of the start of the illness. Anyone with acute respiratory infection who has been to any hospital in China within a fortnight of getting ill will also be treated as a suspect case. \n MORE SCREENINGS \n From today, Changi Airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from China, and not just those from Wuhan. So far, all seven suspected cases in Singapore have proven not to have the Wuhan bug. \n SUSPECT CASES \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. At the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n GP DOCS ON THE WATCH \n All general practice doctors have been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n SPECIAL AMBULANCES \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID.

'888888,1,Growing insecurity over the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in China may have a sharp impact on India\'s already-strained economy as industries fear that the outbreak could cripple their production activities.\nA recent report by Ind-RA said efforts to contain the virus outbreak within next three to four months will be critical as it would determine the fate of many industries around the globe, including in India.\nIf the virus is contained within the aforesaid time period, the impact on businesses in India and elsewhere will not be overgenerous, the report said.\nBut if no positive result comes within a few months, multiple Indian sectors could face major supply-side disturbances, triggering a delay in key manufacturing activities.\nThe Ind-Ra report goes on to highlight that the economic impact could be worse than what was seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003. At that time, the world was less dependent on China, now considered the biggest world\'s biggest manufacturing hub with a substantial contribution to the global GDP.\nChina now contributes to over one-sixth or over 15 per cent of the world\'s GDP and any deceleration in manufacturing activity could significantly impact worldwide growth.\nCommenting on the situation, Sunil Damania, CIO, MarketsMojo.com, said, "For some reason, if China is unable to control it for six months, the impacts would be severe."\n"It\'s very difficult to quantify as there are many moving parts. But it would have a significant impact and has the potential to drag down the world\'s GDP growth rate by at least 20 basis points for CY2020," he added.\nIMPACT ON INDIA\nThe Indian economy is already battling many headwinds including inflation, slow demand, and lower-income, which resulted in a sharp fall in GDP growth in 2019. Economic woes could amplify as many of the country\'s key sectors rely heavily on components or parts manufactured in China.\nWhile the government predicted India\'s growth for the next fiscal at 6.5 per cent, delay in supply of key essential commodities from China for a prolonged period could spill water on that optimistic forecast.\nSome sectors such as automobiles, consumer electronics, drugs and pharmaceuticals -- all of which contribute significantly to the country\'s GDP -- will bear the brunt of the supply curbs. Interlinked sectors will also suffer as a result.\n"If the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated then the risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall economy," Damania said.\nOver the past few weeks, concerned voices from the industry have discussed the issue in detail.\nSome industry experts said trade has already been mildly affected in India as supply chain issues start cropping up. The impact will start showing when firms run out of inventory, they said.\nLOWER JOBS, INFLATION AND MORE\nA delay in the supply of inventory would not only lead to lower production but will also lower sales volume. It could also lead to job cuts and higher inflation.\nFor instance, many electronic goods and phone manufacturers have already started facing the effects of supply slowdown as companies in China failed to restart key manufacturing activities. Major smartphone sellers like Xiaomi hinted at possible rise in prices as supplies of key components are already facing delays.\nA host of Indian smartphone manufacturers, who dearly depend on China for key components, are already indicating that their productions will fall if the supply disruptions continue. It could be a huge blow to India, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world.\nSome analysts are expecting a drop in production and sales of consumer durables and smartphones while others fear that prices could go up in a situation where there is high demand but lack of supply.\nConsumer durables like television, washing machines and air conditioners -- all of which need critical components manufactured in China -- may also see a drop in sales due to lack of supply.\nWhat\'s worse is the fact that it could lead to higher inflationary pressure on India as China vendors have hiked prices of critical components amid the shortage. Higher inflation in times of slow growth could be disastrous for India and could severely disrupt plans to revive the economy.\nLike smartphones, automobile manufacturers also import a host of parts and essential components from China. It may be noted that more than 60 per cent of Chinese auto assembly production units have been directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic.\nA Boston Consulting Group report said the impact on the Chinese automobile industry will affect many other countries including India. A Fitch report said India\'s auto production activity could dip by over 8 per cent in 2020 due to the situation.\n"China supplies India with between 10-30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at India\'s EV segment, which highlights just how exposed India\'s automobile manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle Chinese component manufacturing," it said.\nBut manufacturers in India have little choice apart from monitoring the situation and hoping for factories in China to fire up their assembly lines. Some Chinese factories reopened this week, but workers are in no position to resume activities with no solution in sight.\nAnother concern that India could face due to the virus outbreak in China is job cuts. With lower scope of production activities, some companies will be forced to lay off contractual labourers.\nThis could have a negative effect on India\'s declining income levels.\nLower manufacturing and production activity due to the virus outbreak could pull down India\'s Industrial output, which is also not in good shape. To sum it up, a fall in manufacturing output along with ticking inflation and supply constraints could worsen India\'s growth outlook further.\nAt the time of writing this article, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 1,488 with a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases at over 65,000.\nThe situation in China remains critical with 121 news deaths on Friday while Japan registered its first death, the third fatality outside China.\n'
'888888,0,WUHAN (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - At least 19 people, mostly seniors, died in a social welfare facility in Wuhan located just one block away from the seafood market where the deadly Covid-19 outbreak is suspected to have originated, even though the local government acknowledged only one death from the virus. \n As of last Thursday (Feb 20), 11 seniors died from respiratory failure after recurrent fevers, a nurse at Wuhan Social Welfare Institute told Caixin. She said the facility\'s infirmary didn\'t have Covid-19 testing capability and many medical workers have had fever symptoms. \n The facility recently arranged chest CT scans at a nearby hospital for residents and staff. A scan report the nurse showed a Caixin reporter states that the patient has multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs, similar to many confirmed Covid-19 cases. \n Unexplained deaths from lung ailments among the elderly at the Wuhan Social Welfare Institute and similar facilities suggest that nursing homes may be another blind spot as the government\'s epidemic-fighting efforts have focused on hospitals and other communities. \n Last week it came to light that Chinese prisons reported more than 500 previously uncounted Covid-19 cases among guards and inmates. \n At least two other nursing homes in Wuhan also recorded deaths either possibly from the virus or confirmed cases. A family member of an 85-year-old resident at Gu Tian Rong Ji Nursing Centre told Caixin that his mother died at the nursing home and the family suspected she was infected by a care worker. The head of the nursing home acknowledged that one of the caregivers was confirmed with the coronavirus but denied that the deceased resident was infected by the worker. \n Another community senior care centre with about 40 residents also found eight tested positive for the virus. The rest of the residents and staff are quarantined at the centre and no visitors are allowed, a community worker said. \n The Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau disputed the report about the Wuhan Social Welfare Institute Friday night through the government\'s official WeChat account, saying the facility checked its residents and staff and found that 11 seniors tested positive for the virus and one of them died while being transferred to a hospital. \n According to the government response, the welfare facility started testing residents and staff on Feb 11, although Caixin learnt from sources that multiple seniors died between late December and Feb 19 after showing virus symptoms such as fever, breathing difficulty and loss of appetite. \n After Wuhan tightened quarantine measures to restrict people from leaving their homes and to send the sick into makeshift quarantine quarters, many people lost contact with elderly family members in nursing homes. Family members of people in nursing homes say they have been trying to find out how many residents may be infected, where the elderly are quarantined, whether there are caregivers, what test results show and whether the government can send more medical and care staff to institutions. \n A list of the dead at the social welfare facility obtained by Caixin showed 15 fatalities between Dec 23 and Feb 11 and four more on Feb 18. Of the total of 19 fatalities, only the death of an 83-year-old male on Feb 15 was clearly linked to Covid-19. Eight others were attributed to infections, including six to lung infections and two deaths from shock caused by infection. The remaining 10 fatalities were reportedly from other causes, and five of them took place before Feb 11 when the nursing home started testing for Covid-19. \n The nursing home has never before had so many deaths in such a short time, according to a staff member who has worked there many years. Except for one 27-year-old female with cholecystitis, all of the 18 others on the fatalities list were in their 80s and 90s and most had diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke or disabilities, according to the list. \n The facility, just a few hundred yards from the seafood market that may have been the starting point of the outbreak, is a combination senior hospital and nursing home. It is home to 458 senior residents with 190 staff, 21 property management personnel and eight care workers. The facility has been sealed off since Jan 21 as local authorities stepped up efforts to contain the outbreak. All staff have been asked to stay in the facility. \n A doctor in the welfare facility\'s infirmary said he participated in the treatment of a patient in late December who had a fever as high as 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (42 deg C). The patient died from septic shock possibly caused by infection, but the cause of infection was unknown because no virus check was done, according to the doctor, who was later confirmed infected with Covid-19 himself. \n The doctor said he treated three seniors who died since late December. Several doctors, nurses and attendants have also shown symptoms of lung infection, the doctor said. \n A care worker said more than 10 seniors died during the Chinese New Year holiday. At first, they had fever and lost appetite. Those with recurrent fevers were transferred to quarantine rooms but died after a couple of days, the worker said. \n "Since they were never confirmed with tests, we don\'t know whether they died from the virus," the worker said. "But before the outbreak, even though many of the seniors at the nursing home have chronic diseases, we have never seen so many deaths in such a short time." \n A family member with the last name Zhu said he was told his 92-year-old father died from a heart attack on Feb 11 in the infirmary. The nursing home called the son on Feb 9, telling him to take his father to a hospital because he had a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (40 deg C). As the son had a fever himself and his community was locked down, he couldn\'t come to the nursing home. \n Some family members of deceased seniors told Caixin that the nursing home didn\'t take sufficient protective measures and residents were not even asked to wear masks. \n The doctor at the infirmary said the nursing home wasn\'t sealed off until Jan 21, when the outbreak was already spreading quickly in the city. Because it was close to the Chinese New Year, there were many visitors at the nursing home every day. It hasn\'t been ruled out that visiting family members might have brought the virus into the nursing home, the doctor said. \n A medical worker at the nursing home said it\'s also difficult to implement quarantine measures because of staff shortages and residents with dementia. \n Hubei Vice-Governor Wan Yong emphasised on Saturday in a video conference that nursing homes face severe situations as the elderly are at high risk of infection. The Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau said on Friday that it aimed to finish screening tests on every person in nursing facilities that have found confirmed or suspected vases by Saturday and will finish tests in all other nursing facilities by Feb 28. \n Bao Zhiming, Xiao Hui, Gao Yu contributed to this report. \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global. \n '
'888888,0,A group of Portuguese experts considers that Portugal may not be prepared to contain cases of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that may arise. And they give as an example a suspicious case which, in the end, was not confirmed, was not immediately forwarded to one of the reference hospitals.\nIn an article published in the scientific journal of the Order of Physicians, the Portuguese Medical Acta, Raquel Duarte, the Faculty of Medicine of Porto, Isabel Furtado, the Infecciology Service of the Porto University Hospitality Centre, Luis Sousa, the Public Health Department of the ARS of the North, and Carlos Carvalho, Also from this ARS and the Abel Salazar Biomedical Science Institute, they make a point of the situation regarding the epidemic that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n"In Portugal, contingency plans have been re-activated and new guidelines for health services and airports have been published. However, it is possible that we are not yet ready, even to face a suspicious case of 2019-nCoV,"they point out, referring to what is being done in Portugal.\n"The lack of preparation we witnessed dealing with a single suspicious case (fortunately, unconfirmed) should be used to help healthcare and services correct their mistakes and become better prepared", they justify. For these experts, "these lessons should have been learned a long time ago, following the emergencies of avian influenza H5N1, SARS, the H1N1 pandemic (which happened in 2009 and was initially known as influenza A) and MERS-CoV".\nOn February 1st, there was a suspicious case which took several hours before it was referred to St John\'s Hospital in Porto, one of the reference units to receive these cases. He was an Italian technician who had been in China and who felt bad when he was in a footwear factory in Felgueiras\nYeah. The factory owner complained of a lack of information and the Italian technician spent several hours in a fire ambulance until he was taken to the hospital.\nIn statements to the public, the Union of Emergency Technicians for Pre-Hospitality criticized the delay in the dissemination of standards and the lack of disposable and disinfection material. said to have met with INEM to assess the need to reformulate information and to se e the material available. The Secretary of State for Health, Antonio Lacerda Sales, added that most of the means already have equipment available, such as lab coats and masks.\nEven in the article in the Medical Acts, experts say that, rather than worry about the numbers, "we must ensure that the country is ready to contain the disease immediately after its introduction through suspicion or apparently healthy contact".\nOn the subject of quarantine, since it was adopted in China and in several countries in the case of returnees, Portugal does not have a mandatory quarantine, but 20 return citizens from Wuhan are in prophylactic isolation for 14 days, they point out that "important concerns about freedoms must be considered, but public health must always take precedence".\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThe authors of the article stress that "the 2019-nCoV epidemic is also a test of our ability to face a threat that will be repeated over time". "Each time, we must learn from our mistakes and be better prepared than before," they say.\nThis Wednesday, the Director-General for Health, Grace Freitas, revealed that the Directorate-General for Health met with regional health administrations, health authorities, INEM, the National Health Institute Dr\nYeah. Ricardo Jorge (Insa) and with the network of national laboratories to prepare a second wave of services in the event of an escalation of cases. Contingency plans for hospitals are also being revisited.\nThe Director-General also met with the National Civil Aviation Authority and it was established that airlines flying directly from China to Portugal will distribute on board leaflets containing information on the criteria of suspicious cases and the indication to call SNS24 (808 24 24 24).\n'

"888888,0,The COVID-19 outbreak, which reportedly originated from Wuhan, China, has been particularly tough on Chinese netizens. Most of them had to be quarantined at home, where even those who couldn’t boil an egg had to start figuring out their meal prep (food deliveries in particularly affected cities like Hubei are few and far between).On Chinese social media platform Weibo, bored users started the trending hashtag #QuarantineDiaries as they document their lives at home on mandatory leave. Food photos dominated the posts, with netizens sharing home cooking tutorials and gushing about getting their hands on once commonly-available ingredients that became scarce during their city's lockdown. \n One Weibo user uploaded a photo of a sweet potato, which she had bought from an online group buy spree that finally got delivered to her house. “I have not eaten this for over a month,” she wrote. “I was so touched [when I finally got to eat it] that I cried… and my tears flowed out from the corners of my mouth.” \n Reganmian (‘Hot dry noodles’ in Chinese) is a Wuhan breakfast staple. It’s a basic bowl of dry noodles tossed with soy sauce, sesame paste, pickled vegetables, chopped garlic and chilli oil. A Chinese healthcare worker updated her Weibo log with photos of an ad hoc hot dry noodles assembly station at her hospital workplace, where she and her colleagues DIY-ed quick meals. She muses, “The virus has made us omnipotent. We mop the floors, clear the trash and also make our own hot dry noodles. I’m impressed.” \n There are also quarantined netizens who cook up creative recipes with the free time on their hands. In response to the severe mask shortage, home cooks on Weibo made pancake ‘masks’ from scratch with just a few simple ingredients. One helpful user even uploaded a step-by-step guide to make the viral pancake masks. We have translated it below in case, uh, you wanna make your own. \n  \n The netizen stresses that sugar must be added, or the mask “won’t be nice to eat”. \n “The egg yolk is added to give the mask a nice golden colour, and make it crispier,” explains the netizen. \n Cover the dough with cling wrap and let it rest for half an hour. \n Roll each individual small ball into a flat rectangle shape, and sprinkle some plain flour on it so it doesn’t stick to surfaces. The netizen adds, “Roll [the disc] thinner, as it will become thicker when you fold it into the shape of a mask.” \n Pleat the ‘folds’ and add dough ‘straps’. Then poke 'stitches' along the edges of the mask with a fork or toothpick for extra realism. “But it’s okay if you don’t do it, ’cos [the holes don’t show up] after you cook it anyway,” says the netizen. \n  \n Netizen: “Why did I call it a single-use mask? Because it’s gone after I eat it hahaha.” \n If surgical masks are too mainstream for you, there’s the N95 steamed mantou version. \n There are also pancake masks flavoured with vegetable and fruit juices for variety. \n Like these doughy bats, which the Weibo folks confidently claim “are definitely edible” (the novel coronavirus purportedly originated from people consuming infected wild bats). \n Another netizen also concocted ‘COVID-19 meatballs’ by pushing enoki mushrooms into handmade minced beef balls to mimic the virus strain. \n The end result looks horrifying, as it should be. \n In a bid to eat healthily to boost their immune system, some folks also made fried ‘onion rings’ with cored apple slices. It actually looks pretty yummy, even if the deep-frying negates its nutritional value. \n And of course, someone found a way to utilise all the used plastic bottles of cooking condiments — by making a gas mask.PHOTOS: WEIBO \n "
"888888,0,New York, February 5. /tass/ China's pneumonia epidemic, caused by the 2019 ncov virus, could affect Capri holdings, a US based company with a stylish Versace brand, and Michael kors and Jimmy Choo, who lost $100 million. CNN reported the situation Wednesday, citing the company's estimates as of the end of the year.\nAs of February 5, the company had to close 150 of 225 stores in China, while the rest fell sharply.\nAt the end of December 2019, Chinese authorities recorded an outbreak of pneumonia caused by 2019 ncov virus in Wuhan. In addition to China, 24 countries, including Russia, have found the disease.

'888888,0,At the end of 2019, a coronavirus has broken through the species barrier, reached humans and is scaring the world. Since it\'s a new virus infecting humans, there\'s still a lot to know about it. The scientific community and public health authorities have been working together to get to know the details and as soon as possible. What do we really know about this epidemic with epicenter in the city of Wuhan in the center of China?\nAre there already cases in Portugal of infection with the new coronavirus? Yes, the first two cases of Portuguese with Covid-19 were confirmed this Monday (2nd March). The first case was one of a 60-year-old doctor on holiday in northern Italy. He was admitted to St. Anthony\'s Hospital in Porto and experienced the first symptoms on 29 in February. The second case was confirmed by a 33-year-old commercial in the construction sector returned from Valencia, Spain. He was admitted to St John\'s Hospital in Oporto and experienced the first symptoms at 26 in February. This Tuesday, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed two more cases: that of a man 60-year-old who is connected to another case already confirmed in Portugal and is at the University Hospital Centre of St John in Oporto; and that of a man 37 years since he was also linked to another case and is at Curry Cabral Hospital in Lisbon.\nWhat\'s the name of the virus and the disease? The official name of the virus is coronavirus of severe acute 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), as it has genetic similarities to SARS-CoV in about 80%. This designation was assigned by the International Committee for Virus Taxonomy and published this week in an article in the bioRxiv free access repository. Until then, it has been temporarily designated "2019-nCoV".\nThe name chosen for the disease caused by the virus was "Covid-19", which emerged from the English acronym for the expression "coronavirus disease 2019" (coronavirus disease 2019Yeah. The decision was taken by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nBoth the name of the virus and the disease were chosen in such a way that there are no references to specific geographical locations, groups of people or animals, so that stigmatisation is avoided.\nIs it known what the origin of the new coronavirus is and how it passed on to humans? No, there are only suspicions. In a recent report, the WHO indicated that there is increasing evidence that there is a link between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses found in bats, especially those of subspecies of the genus Rhinolophus, which are abundant in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. The transmission circuit is also unknown and "the most likely scenario is that an intermediate host animal played a role in the transmission". Last week, a team of Chinese scientists concluded that Pangolim is a potential intermediate host of the virus.\nDiscovering the source of the coronavirus may help to understand how the onset of the outbreak took place in Wuhan City and thus prevent future coronavirus outbreaks. There are several teams, including one from the WHO in China, trying to answer these and other questions.\nWhat symptoms does it cause? Dry cough, fever, fatigue and difficulty breathing. Most people have flu-like symptoms and a small proportion of patients will develop pneumonia. In the most serious cases of pneumonia, organ failure may occur and Covid-19 becomes fatal.\nHow is it transmitted? Through direct contact with infected people. This can happen through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, saliva droplets or nose secretions. Therefore, the WHO recommends having a "good respiratory hygiene practice", such as sneezing at the elboYeah. It is also important that people wash their hands regularly when they are in contact with people with the symptoms of Covid-19.\nAlthough the origin may have been an animal, there is no evidence to indicate that a domestic animal can transmit this coronavirus. Even so, the WHO states that food should be cooked with care to avoid cross contamination or to pay attention to contact with live animals or areas on live animal markets.\nAs to whether it is safe to receive an order from China, one of the most frequently asked questions, the WHO undoubtedly answers: "It is safe. People are not in danger of contracting the new coronavirus if they receive orders. From the experience we have of other coronaviruses, this type of virus does not survive long in objects such as letters and packages."\nCan asymptomatic people really transmit this coronavirus? Yes, it may be possible that people infected with the virus may be infectious before showing significant symptoms, refers to WHO, which cites recent reports. Even so, according to the available data, people who have symptoms are causing most of the cases. It takes more clinical information to determine what the infectious period is.\nAnd what is the incubation period? For now, it is estimated that it can go from one to 12,5 days and that the average is between five to six days. The WHO states that these estimates should still be improved, but on the basis of information on other coronavirus diseases, the incubation period should be four days.\nIn February, a team of Chinese scientists announced that the average incubation period would be only three days and that this period could extend to 24 days. These preliminary results were briefly reported at the MedRxiv Health Science Research portaYeah. At a press conference, the Director General for Portuguese Health, Grace Freitas, did not value the study, saying it is information "that is not validated", "one of the many studies that are circulating" and that the WHO does not even mention it.\nHow dangerous can this virus be? Based on the available data, the mortality rate is about three%. However, this number may be overestimated because it only takes into account confirmed cases and there may be even more infected people, according to information made available by the UK Science Media Centre.\nHave we reached the peak of the epidemic? We don\'t know yet. February 12th, the WHO announced that the number of new cases of coronavirus had stabilised the previous week. However, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, warred that care was needed for interpretations made from there: "This outbreak could still go in any direction." On the very next day more than 13 thousand new cases were recorded in a single day in the Hubei region, where Wuhan is. The WHO points out that this was due to a change in the way cases were diagnosed. "We have seen a significant spike in the number of cases reported in China, but there is no significant change in the course of the Covid-19 outbreak," said Mike Ryan, Director of the WHO Emergency Programme at a press conference later this week. He also pointed out that Covid-19 cases are not rising dramatically outside China. The exception was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which confirmed more 44 cases. All along, that ship quarantined in Japan already had over 200 confirmed cases.\nIn an interview with Reuters, epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan (researcher of the Chinese National Health Commission) was optimistic and stated that the peak of the outbreak could be reached in mid-or late April. But it\'s too early for prognosisYeah.\nWho could be more vulnerable to the virus? It has yet to be better understood how this coronavirus affects people, but older people and people with pre-existing diseases appear to be at greater risk of seriously developing Covid-19.\nHow many infected people have recovered worldwide? According to data from the real-time Worldometer statistics website of 80.026 confirmed cases in mainland China, 44.462 (56%) managed to recover from the disease. According to Johns Hopkins University (USA), the recovery rate in China exceeds the 50%barrier.\nHow long does the virus survive on the surfaces? It is not well known either, but WHO refers to preliminary information suggesting that it may survive "a few hours or more". Simple disinfectants may be enough for the virus not to last long enough to infect people.\nIs there a specific treatment? No, there is still no specific medicine or treatment recommended to prevent or treat Covid-19. Infected people receive health care to alleviate or treat their symptoms. In the most serious cases, they receive organ support therapy. Because it\'s a virus, the WHO warns that antibiotics won\'t kill it.\nApproximately 300 experts meeting in Geneva (Switzerland) in February at a meeting organised by the WHO set out different priorities: the treatment of people already infected with Covid-19; finding easy ways to test; and understanding the behaviour of the virus.\nDetails of the treatments for the virus were also given. Quoted by New Scientist magazine, WHO noted that results of clinical trials to determine whether HIV medicines (lopinavir and ritonavir) are effective for treating Covid-19 symptoms "will be known in a few days or weeksYeah. Clinical trials for remdesivir (which was initially developed for Ebola virus) are also expected to be ready in "a few weeks". Four Covid-19 vaccines are also being developed at the moment. The WHO estimated that in three or four months\'time, people would start testing for one or two of these vaccines and that one would be available for general use in 18 months\' time.\nWhat are the recommendations for people to protect themselves? These are the basic recommendations used to reduce any risk of acute respiratory infection and are mainly for travellers, such as: avoiding close contact with people with these infections; frequently washing their hands, especially after being in direct contact with sick people; avoid unprotected contact with wild animals or for human consumption; or adopt respiratory label measures.\nIf you have been in an area where Covid-19 has existed or still exists, you should follow the recommendations of the WHO and the national and local health authorities. If you have not been in an area where you have Covid-19 and have not been with infected people, your risk of infection is low, refers to the WHO in a recent report. "It is understandable that you may be anxious about this epidemic. But check the facts from credible sources to help you determine the risks accurately and be able to take reasonable precautions,"he also recommends to the WHO. The Health Directorate has created a website dedicated to the new coronavirus.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIf you have symptoms, what should you do? In general, the Directorate-General for Health recommends that people coming from an affected area where they may have had contact with patients should actively monitor and contact the SNS 24 (808 24 24) line to get advice on what to do. "It will be a case-by-case worYeah. And other measures may be defined from the counselling,"said Grace Freitas, Director General of Health, at a press conference.\nWhich Portuguese hospitals may receive infected patients? In the north of the country, they are able to receive patients with the new coronavirus hospitals of San Juan and San Antonio, both in Oporto, as well as the Braga Hospital, the Local Health Unit (ULS) of Matosinhos and the Tamega and Sousa Hospitality Centre. At the center, the response is reinforced at the Guard ULS and the Coimbra Children\'s Hospital. In the region of Lisbon and Vale do Tejo, are the University of Lisbon Centre for Hospitality Northern (Santa Maria Hospital and Pulido Valente Hospital) and the Western Lisbon University Hospital for Hospitality (Egas Moniz Hospital and San Francisco Xavier Hospital). In Alentejo, she is ready to admit patients with the new coronavirus to Litoral ULS Alentejano. In the Algarve, the answer is provided through the Algarve University Hospitality Centre.\nIs this a pandemic already? No. The WHO considers that coronavirus is not yet a pandemic, a term used to describe situations in which an infectious disease threatens many people simultaneously and around the world. "We are in an epidemic phase with multiple outbreaks," said Sylvie Briand, director of the global preparedness department for WHO infectious risks. At the moment, over a 90 thousand people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have died from more than three thousand people around the world, according to the data from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC).

'888888,0,PARIS (AFP) - Members of China\'s Uighur minority living in exile are sounding the alarm over the risk of the coronavirus spreading in camps inside the country, where non-governmental organisations\xa0say hundreds of thousands of people have been rounded up by Beijing. \n So far, official figures released by Chinese state media give no major cause for concern over the outbreak of the disease , known as\xa0Covid-19,\xa0in the north-eastern region of Xinjiang that is home to the Uighurs, a Muslim minority who speak a Turkic language. \n It is far from the epicentre of the outbreak and just 55 cases have been reported in the region so far. The first patients to fully recover in the region have already left hospital, according to official media. \n Over 1,100 people have died in China due to the coronavirus epidemic although most of the deaths and infections have been in the central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicentre of the outbreak. \n But representatives of the Uighur diaspora warn there is real reason to fear a rapid spread of coronavirus in the controversial Chinese camps. \n The virus spreads from person to person through droplets disseminated by sneezing or coughing, and confining large groups of people together, possibly without adequate access to germ-killing soap and water, will increase the likelihood of an outbreak. \n China has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic minorities in internment camps, NGOs and experts say, and little is known about the conditions inside them. \n Beijing insists the camps are "vocational training centres" necessary to combat terrorism. \n "People are starting to panic. Our families are there, dealing with the camps and the virus, and we do not know if they have enough to eat or if they have masks," said Dilnur Reyhan, a French sociologist of Uighur origin. \n A petition posted on Change.org signed by over 3,000 people urges the closure of the camps to reduce the threat. \n There have also been social media hashtag campaigns such as #VirusThreatInThecamps and #WHO2Urumqi to urge the World Health Organisation (WHO) to send a delegation to the city of Xinjiang. \n "We must not wait until news of hundreds of coronavirus-related deaths in the camps before we react," the petition says. \n "As China continues to struggle to contain the virus in Wuhan, we can easily assume the virus will rapidly spread throughout the camps and affect millions if we don\'t raise the alarm now." \n Regional authorities in Xinjiang did not respond to a query from AFP about measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus in the camps. \n The World Uyghur Congress (WUC), one of several groups representing Uighurs outside China, said it was very concerned "that if measures are not taken to further limit the spread of this virus, it could rapidly infect large numbers of people" in Xinjiang. \n "These people are in a vulnerable and weakened state due to the Chinese government\'s abuses and mistreatment," said its president Dolkun Isa. \n "This has just further compounded the suffering of the Uighur people, as our friends and family are now in even greater danger." \n French immunologist Norbert Gualde said it was impossible to say precisely under what conditions the Uighurs and other detainees are living in Chinese camps. \n "There are good reasons to think that their detention is synonymous with imposed proximity, stress and fear - all circumstances that favour the transmission of a virus between those obliged to remain incarcerated," he said. \n '

'888888,0,WUHAN, China - The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged, began lifting a two-month lockdown on Saturday by restarting some metro services and reopening borders, allowing some semblance of normality to return and families to reunite.  \n After being cut-off from the rest of the country for two months, the reopening of Wuhan, where the epidemic first erupted in late December, marks a turning point in China\'s fight against the virus, though the contagion has since spread to over 200 countries.  \n Among those on the first high-speed trains allowed into the city on Saturday morning was Guo Liangkai, a 19-year-old student whose one-month work stint in Shanghai stretched to three months due to the clamp down on movement.  \n "It makes me very happy that I can see my family," Guo told Reuters after being greeted by his mother at the main station.  \n "We wanted to hug but now is a special period so we can\'t hug or take any actions like these."  \n Authorities took draconian measures to stop people from entering or leaving the industrial city of 11 million people in central China. Families were confined to their homes. Bus and taxi services were shut, and only essential stores were allowed to remain open.  \n "I think the resumption of work represents a kind of hope. It at least shows that China is victorious," said Zhang Yulun, 35, returning to Wuhan for work.  \n China\'s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. Mainland China now has 81,394 cases, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said.  \n Wuhan accounts for about 60% of China\'s coronavirus cases, but they have fallen sharply in recent weeks, a sign that the measures are working. The last confirmed locally transmitted case of the virus in Wuhan was on Monday.  \n With the United States, Italy and Spain and other countries now battling soaring infections, China is focussing on the risk posed by imported cases - most of them Chinese returning home.  \n Effective Saturday, China suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits.  \n  \n DISINFECTANT AND MASKS  \n But even with the decline in cases and loosening of restrictions, Wuhan authorities were taking few chances.  \n Staff, some in full-body protective gear, and volunteers bustled around the railway station in the morning, setting out hand disinfectant and putting up signs reminding travellers they need a mobile-phone based health code to take public transport.  \n A worker walked through one metro train carrying a signboard reading: "Wear a mask for the entire journey, people should not gather and when you disembark please scan the health code."  \n "Everyone is taking the right precautions. So, there shouldn’t be a problem," Yuan Hai, 30, a passenger on a reopened metro line said when asked about the risks. "But you have to be careful."  \n The existence of an unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that lifting the restrictions may release thousands of people who could still be spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, without knowing they are sick.  \n Life in Wuhan remains far from normal. The vast majority of shops are shut while bright yellow roadblocks remain. Wuhan will not let people leave the city until April 8.  \n Some people at the railway station, such as a woman who only gave her surname as Zhang, said they were there to see if there was any chance people could leave earlier.  \n Her grandson came to visit her for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in January and has been separated from his parents in the southern city of Shenzhen ever since. With schools there possibly reopening, she hopes he can get back soon.  \n "He was supposed to leave on the fifth day (of the holiday) but has now been here for a few months," she said. REUTERS \n '

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — Although it is still far too early to say the worst is over, the Covid-19 outbreak appears to have tapered off in Singapore in the past week, several experts said on Friday (Feb 21), four weeks after the coronavirus was first confirmed here. \n However, there is a growing concern that further cases of the infection could arrive from countries outside China and disrupt this recent positive streak, four infectious health diseases experts said in giving their take on the broad Covid-19 picture to date. \n Since the peak of confirmed cases a week ago, when nine cases were confirmed here in one day, Feb 14, experts noted that the number of new cases detected has fallen steadily, although there is no way to be certain that another surge will not happen. \n On both Thursday and Friday only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 in Singapore was reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n On Wednesday, three cases were reported, including a 57-year-old woman who had initially been admitted to hospital for dengue fever. It was later confirmed she had both Covid-19 and dengue. \n No new clusters of local transmission have been detected for several days and most of the latest cases can all be traced back to earlier ones. A large number of patients confirmed with the disease have\xa0been discharged from the hospitals where they had been isolated. \n “The hysteria will quieten down in the next month unless something unexpected happens,"\xa0Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) research policy and co-operation department in Geneva told TODAY. \n "But, as I have said, the virus will most likely remain in the population. In my view? Normalise everything and learn to live with the virus,” he added. \n Recent reports from China, where the disease Covid-19 originated, have suggested that new transmission of the virus that causes it, Sars-CoV-2, has also fallen dramatically over the last few days. \n Referring to this trend, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said that Chinese data “appears to show a decline in new cases’’ but noted that any apparent trend “must be interpreted very cautiously”. \n Using data made available by the Singapore MOH, TODAY looked at how the pace of the Covid-19 outbreak has changed over the past four weeks since Case 1, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and was confirmed with the disease on Jan 23. \n DOWNWARD TREND IN THE NUMBER OF CASES IN PAST WEEK \n  \n Looking at the daily number of confirmed cases, the Covid-19 situation appears to have slowed in the past week, with a sharp drop in the number of cases from the record of nine on Feb 14 to one confirmed case on Friday. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said it looks like the number of cases found on Feb 13 and 14, mostly arising from the Grace Assembly of God cluster, appears to be the peak of the outbreak in Singapore. \n "The number of cases is coming down,” said Dr Leong. \n He noted that Singapore has been doing hundreds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per day — the test used to detect Covid-19 — and these cases must be seen in that context. \n “This means that we are truly looking for a needle in the haystack, which means the number of cases is truly low. There are very few, if not no cases of active transmission in Singapore,” he said. \n Agreeing with Dr Leong, Dr Pangestu said that the supposed peak outbreak here on Feb 14 is consistent with earlier scientific models that predicted that the number of new infections of the Covid-19 virus would peak in mid to late February. Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan, the eminent 83-year-old epidemiologist who had discovered the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, had given the same prediction as well. \n One study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted a February peak based on the basic reproductive number of Covid-19, which is the expected number of cases directly generated by one patient. For Covid-19, this number averages between 1.5 and 4.5. \n Biostatistician Alex Cook, who is the vice dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it is “certainly a good thing that the number of cases has been going down”. \n “(This falling trend) reflects the cases to identify and be isolated, and the efforts of MOH to conduct contact tracing, and healthcare workers to minimise infection in hospitals,” said Associate Professor Cook, who is the domain leader for biostatistics and modelling at the school. \n His colleague, Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the school’s programme leader of infectious diseases and the co-director of global health, added that the fall in the number of confirmed cases in the past week indicates that Singapore’s efforts have been successful in limiting the spread of Covid-19. \n “It is likely that current massive contact tracing — initiated right at the start of the outbreak in Singapore — has led to the majority of cases being uncovered. Current quarantine and social distancing measures have also worked to reduce transmission in Singapore,” said Assoc Prof Hsu. \n FEWER NEW PRIMARY CASES DETECTED IN RECENT WEEKS \n  \n A key indicator is the number of primary cases found on a given day — patients who have had no known link to previous cases and could have contracted the virus through local transmission. \n Singapore upgraded its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level to Orange on Feb 7 when it discovered another three such primary cases, including Case 32, a Victoria Junior College teacher who had no recent travel history to China and no known link to the earlier cases. \n While finding these primary cases helps the authorities discover new ones through contact-tracing, they also highlight that there are more unknowns about how the Covid-19 situation is spreading in the community, said experts. \n But in the past week, no new cluster and fewer primary cases have appeared. The exceptions are the recently discovered Case 82, a 57-year-old Singaporean who had contracted both dengue and Covid-19, and Case 85, a 35-year-old Chinese national who did not travel to China recently. \n As these cases were confirmed only recently, a link could be established later when more detailed contact tracing has taken place. \n Commenting on this trend of fewer primary cases in the past week, Prof Pangestu said he hoped this would help to calm the public. \n While it could also mean that potential primary cases are still hidden from view, it is unlikely as the Singapore Government has been “very vigilant” in contact tracing. The trend shows that infected people have been effectively detected, isolated and treated. \n “It’s the nature of these epidemics — they start explosively and then run out of steam as public health measures kick in and the virus runs out of susceptible hosts.” \n Dr Leong noted that with Singapore expanding its case definitions to screen all patients with pneumonia for Covid-19, it is unlikely that cases would fall under the radar. \n But Singapore’s strengths in contact tracing will still be limited by the ability for patients to recall where they have been and with whom they have interacted, which could account for those cases with no known links, he said. \n “Lousy recollection means lousy contact tracing, which leads to lousy curtailment. We need to think out of the box,” said Dr Leong, suggesting that there should be a mobile phone application that is able to help build Singapore’s capability in contact tracing in future. \n LARGE PORTION OF EARLIER CASES DISCHARGED \n  \n Experts also noted that a majority of the cases detected in the first two weeks of the outbreak have been discharged, a trend that is similar to the experience in other countries. This high rate of discharges is also a sign that the Covid-19 situation is improving in Singapore. \n As of Friday, 47 out of the 86 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. The number of cases in critical condition — five currently — has also come down. \n The number of discharged cases does not include Covid-19 patients who do not suffer from any symptoms throughout their infection but are still hospitalised. \n Assoc Prof Hsu noted that in this regard, data published out of China and other countries has\xa0been similar. \n “Covid-19 infections are mild for more than 80 per cent of patients, which means these patients would not have needed hospitalisation based on medical needs alone. The patients were kept isolated in hospital to minimise the risk that they would spread the virus to others in the community,” he said. \n While there is no known vaccine for the disease yet, in Singapore and elsewhere, Covid-19 patients are treated with a mix of antiviral drugs normally used for HIV cases, such as ritonavir and lopinavir. These have been promising, Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, MOH’s chief health scientist said previously. \n Besides Singapore becoming more adept at treating Covid-19, there is also the chance that the virus could be turning milder which would explain why the newer cases are not so severe, said Dr Leong. \n Of the cases in China, Covid-19 has a mortality rate of around 2.3 per cent. By comparison, Sars had a mortality rate of 9.6 per cent during the 2003 outbreak, while Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) has a fatality rate of 35 per cent. \n The mortality rate of Covid-19 outside China — based on a small number of deaths — is lower still, at around 0.2 per cent, which is similar to swine flu and slightly above the seasonal flu. \n Prof Pangestu added: “The implication of this? It simply proves that most cases of Covid-19 are not severe and people should not be unduly concerned. It’s just like the flu and Zika.” \n MAJORITY OF CASES WITH NO LINK TO CHINA \n  \n However, a concerning statistic has emerged in recent weeks: Cases that cannot be traced back to mainland China have now exceeded those with a known link to China, said experts. \n Dr Leong said while it is no cause for alarm, the fact that a majority of cases have no link to China shows how close Singapore came to losing the ability to contain the viral spread from China. \n He said strong contact tracing helped to rein in the numbers, otherwise the unknown cases would continue to mount. \n “The first round of infection comes from China. The second round comes from locals who were infected with contact with the Chinese. That is expected in any ongoing epidemic. It is crucial to keep the lid on the second group and we seem to have done it,” said Dr Leong. \n But the experts suggested that something more surreptitious could be at play given the mounting travel restrictions against China. There is a growing concern that undetected cases of Covid-19 may be entering Singapore from other countries. \n Said Dr Leong: “Within China, the numbers are coming down and it is good that viral spread in the source (country) is being controlled. But the more important question is those who have left China and seeded to countries with less resources — can they take the heat?” \n Covid-19 cases outside China are growing at an accelerating rate. The number of new cases detected outside China climbed at a steady rate since Feb 7, and crossed the threshold of 100 new daily cases for the first time on Feb 17 and has remained high ever since. \n While the number of imported cases of Covid-19 in Singapore has\xa0been negligible after Singapore put in place border control measures, Assoc Prof Cook predicts that this could climb again, with increasing numbers of imports from other countries seeding more clusters in Singapore. \n “In normal times there is a lot of travel to and from Singapore and places like Japan and Thailand, both of which have quite large numbers of confirmed cases,” he said. \n Given Singapore’s close proximity and connections to Malaysia and Indonesia, Assoc Prof Cook said he is also concerned about the risk of future importation from these two nations. Indonesia has zero detected cases of Covid-19, though a Harvard study had questioned whether this was due to its lack of detection rather than the incidence of the virus. \n “With more cases being observed beyond China it looks far too early to celebrate,” said Assoc Prof Cook. \n \xa0 \n '
'888888,1,* Total infections hit 440, with death toll of nine\n* China to restrict public gatherings in Hubei\n* Officials being urged not to conceal information\n* Travel warnings issued as virus spreads\nBy Cate Cadell and David Stanway\nBEIJING/SHANGHAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The death toll from a new flu-like coronavirus in China rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases, Chinese health officials said as authorities stepped up efforts to control the outbreak by discouraging public gatherings in Hubei province.\nAnother 2,197 cases of close contact with patients had been confirmed and there was evidence of “respiratory transmission” of the virus, National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin told reporters.\nAs China also vowed to tighten containment measures in hospitals, the World Health Organization (WHO) is due to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to determine whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus constitutes a global health emergency.\nThe virus, originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.\nThe Chinese government has been providing daily updates on the number of cases in a bid to head off public panic, as millions of people prepare to travel domestically and abroad for the country’s Lunar New Year celebrations starting this week.\nHubei had been asked to minimise public gatherings and people across the country were urged to avoid densely populated areas in general, the health commission said. China also would step up cooperation with the WHO, Li added.\nOfficials found to have covered up infections would be a “sinner for eternity before the Party and the people”, the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Political and Legal Commission said in a post on its WeChat social media account that was subsequently deleted\n.\n“I’m not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.\nFears of a pandemic similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people in 2002-2003 have roiled global markets, with aviation and luxury goods stocks hit particularly hard and the Chinese yuan tumbling.\nThe WHO said on Tuesday the new coronavirus was likely to spread to other parts of China and possibly other countries in coming days.\nWHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said new cases would appear as China stepped up monitoring. “If you increase surveillance and testing you are likely to get new numbers,” he added.\nHong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, one of the airlines affected the most by the SARS outbreak, said it would allow flight attendants to wear a surgical mask while operating mainland China flights due to concerns over the new virus.\nThe Cathay Pacific Airways Flight Attendants Union said it had received a “tremendous” amount of messages from members concerned over catching the virus, and attendants on all flights should have the option to wear a mask.\n“All of them are worried about the risk they are taking every time they go to work,” the union said on its Facebook page.\nTaiwan joined Australia in warning citizens to avoid travel to Wuhan, and airports around the world have stepped up screening of travellers from China.\n“I want to call on our nationals please not to visit this region if not necessary,” Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen wrote on her Facebook page.\nA Bank of Korea official said worries over the virus may impact domestic consumer spending.\nFifteen medical personnel are among those infected in China\n. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The viral infection can cause pneumonia and can be passed from person to person.\nThough the origin of the virus has yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan’s seafood market.\n'
'888888,0,By Ali Imran Mohd NoordinKUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) -- The first seven days of February saw various developments in Malaysia\'s efforts to check the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak.This afternoon, Health Minister Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad announced\xa0that 15 people in Malaysia have so far been tested positive for the new coronavirus. Eleven of the cases involved Chinese citizens (10 are from Wuhan and one from Guangzhou) while the remaining four cases involved Malaysians.In Malaysia, from Jan 10 up to today (Feb 7), the total cumulative cases of patients under investigation (PUI) stood at 313. Seven of these cases tested positive for 2019-nCoV, 297 tested negative and nine are awaiting laboratory test results.Over the week, there\xa0were three important developments with regard to 2019-nCoV. The first was the humanitarian mission to Wuhan where a special flight brought home a number of Malaysians and their families who had been stranded there since Jan 23 after the city was put on lockdown by the\xa0Chinese government.\xa0In the second development, the first case of 2019-nCoV infection involving a Malaysian was revealed. The number of Malaysians tested positive for the coronavirus has since increased to four.In the third development, two Malaysians were charged in court for making false statements with regard to 2019-nCoV on their Facebook accounts.\xa0HUMANITARIAN MISSIONThe Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) mission was carried out successfully. AirAsia Flight AK8264 took off from KLIA2 at 3.20 pm on Feb 3 for Wuhan. Its cargo included half a million pairs of rubber gloves, constituting Malaysia\'s contribution to China in its efforts to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.On Feb 4 at 5.57 am, the aircraft touched down at KLIA, carrying on board 88 Malaysians and 19 of their non-Malaysian family members who were stuck in Wuhan; 12 flight crew members; eight HADR officials; and six officers from the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing. Another 34 people stranded in Wuhan who were supposed to return to Malaysia\xa0could not catch the flight due to logistics issues.After the plane landed in KLIA, all 133 passengers and crew were ferried to the Air Disaster Unit in a bus for health screening. Out of the 107 people \'rescued\' from Wuhan, two did not pass the screening and were sent to Hospital Kuala Lumpur.The remaining 105 passengers were taken in a bus to the Higher Education Leadership Academy (AKEPT) in Bandar Enstek, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, for the 14-day quarantine process.The two passengers who failed the health screening were eventually tested negative for 2019-nCoV and they were taken to AKEPT to be quarantined.On Feb 5, Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah said Malaysia will bring home all government staff and their family members\xa0in China as soon as possible.\xa0CASES INVOLVING MALAYSIANSOn Feb 4, the Health Minister announced the first Malaysian who was tested positive for the coronavirus, a 41-year-old man from Selangor who had travelled to Singapore for a meeting from Jan 16-23.\xa0 He was tested positive on Feb 3.The man\'s sister was tested positive for coronovirus on Feb 6 after coming into contact with him in Sungai Petani, Kedah. She is now in the isolation ward at Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Alor Setar.The Health Ministry, in the meantime, has also implemented the process of tracing the close contacts of the 2019-nCoV cases.On Feb 5, a father and child who were among those flown back from Wuhan in the HADR mission were tested positive for the coronavirus. The 45-year-old father and his nine-year-old son did not show any sign of infection when they were first taken to AKEPT. The two are now in the isolation ward at Hospital Tuanku Ja’afar, Seremban.\xa0FAKE NEWSOn Feb 5, Attorney General Tan Sri Tommy Thomas said those who initiate and disseminate false information relating to 2019-nCoV on the Internet would be investigated and charged in court if there is a case against them.Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk Mazlan Mansor said as of now 13 investigation papers have been opened in relation to the dissemination of fake news in respect of 2019-nCoV on social media. He said one case was filed in the Kuala Lumpur court on Feb 5 and one more case in Kuala Terengganu on Feb 6. A third case will be filed in Sandakan later.\xa0Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador advised Malaysians not to waste time disseminating fake news with regard to the coronavirus as it would cause unnecessary panic among the public."Yesterday, there was a fake post about a ship that supposedly docked in Kuala Linggi (Melaka) and, according to the person who posted it, the ship came from Wuhan. It is a false report," he said, adding that the post could have caused panic among the villagers in Kuala Linggi.\xa0OTHER DEVELOPMENTSFeb 1 - Malaysia\'s diving squad undergoing training in Chengdu, China, returned home following the 2019-nCoV outbreak.Feb 3 - Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA) contacted two students in China sponsored by the agency to find out about their status.Feb 5 - The Ministry of Finance announced that it will hold a multi-ministry discussion with stakeholders to plan an economic stimulus package to overcome the economic impact from the cononavirus outbreak.Feb 5 - The Health Ministry listed 10 hospitals and public health laboratories where tests can be carried out to detect 2019-nCoV cases.6 Feb - Two pharmacies in Kulai and Johor Bahru were issued compounds after they were found selling face masks at prices higher than permitted.Feb 6 - Sarawak is still free from 2019-nCoV, the State Disaster Management Committee said in a statement.\xa0Translated by Rema NambiarBERNAMA\xa0\r\n\xa0'
'888888,0,According to a report by the Central News Agency today, the Lancet journal points out that there may be multiple foci of pneumonia in Wuhan. According to a recent Wuhan pneumonia research paper published by the lancet, a British Medical Journal, from the top 41 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan, China, the South China seafood market is not the only place where the new pneumonia epidemic originated, but may be a large area with multiple foci.\nAccording to the report, a paper published by lancet on the 24th local time disclosed the situation of the top 41 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital. A chart in the paper shows that three of the top four infected people have no history of exposure to the South China seafood market, which has been regarded as the focus of the South China seafood market. Huang Zhaolin, vice president of the Wuhan golden Yin Tan Hospital, said: "from the whole epidemic situation, the seafood market is not the only source of exposure," the origin of the new coronavirus is multisource. Cao Bin, the correspondence author and chief physician of respiratory and Critical Medicine Department of China Japan Friendship Hospital, also said in reply to science: "it seems clear now that the seafood market in South China is not the only focus, but to be honest, we don\'t know where the virus comes from."\nAccording to the paper, the first case of new coronavirus infection in the hospital was recorded in December 1, 2019. There was no history of exposure to the seafood market in Southern China. No fever or respiratory symptoms were reported in the family. In December 10th, only 3 people were infected. Two of them did not have a history of exposure to the seafood market in Southern China. Of the top 41 patients admitted to Jinyintan hospital, only 27 had contact with the South China seafood market.\nAccording to the 26 China Disease Control and Prevention Center, 585 samples from Southern China seafood market detected 33 samples containing new coronavirus nucleic acids, and successfully isolated virus from positive environmental samples, suggesting that the virus originated from wild animals sold in Southern China seafood market. These positive samples were distributed in 22 stalls and 1 garbage truck on the market\n。\nTang Jinling, Professor of epidemiology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, was quoted as saying, "there should be multiple sources of viruses in the South China seafood market at that time, and they are relatively scattered. Dozens of patients appear at the same time in a short period of time, and there is no history of contact with each other, indicating that the infected wild animals may not accidentally enter a stall, but enter multiple doors at the same time in a short period of time Shop, this can cause so many people at the same time. According to him, the virus may have become more common in wild animal infectious sources, which increases the possibility of these animals entering other markets or re entering the market and infecting human beings.\nAccording to the report, Tang Jinling said that the original birthplace may not be a point, but a large area, and there is the possibility of people passing on people. Considering that some of the initial infected people have no contact history with the seafood market in South China and have close contact history with the infected people, in addition to the seafood market in South China, it is also necessary to consider whether there is virus detection in other markets in Wuhan, so as to find out how large the scope of "a large area" is, so as to completely cut off the chance of reinfection of animals to human beings. But he also stressed that these assumptions are based on the limited information at present and need further investigation and verification.\n'
"888888,0,Rome, February 7 - Russian news agency, Sergei startsev. Italy's top Institute of health has reported that the first case of Italian infection with coronaveros 2019 ncov has been confirmed in Rome. Citizens returning from Wuhan, China, tested a new virus on Monday, and the results were positive.\nAccording to local media reports, ISS informed members of the coronavirus ad hoc working group of the Italian Ministry of health. This is one of 56 Italians who flew back from Wuhan on Monday. The men were held in the military city of chekkinyola, the capital, where they were quarantined.\nEarlier Thursday, it was reported that an adult man from Wuhan was taken to the National Institute of infectious diseases in Rome at a high temperature. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte confirmed to reporters that medical authorities are carrying out necessary tests for possible new coronavirus infections.\nLast week, two elderly Chinese tourists were found suffering from the coronavirus in Italy and are being treated by Lazzaro Spallanzani. Their condition deteriorated on Wednesday and they were transferred to intensive care.\nThe Italian Council of Ministers adopted a six-month state of emergency decision on 31 January.\nAbout Five million euros have been allocated for the implementation of the act. It was also decided that, in addition to cargo flights, air services with China would be stopped.\nOn December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities reported to who that an unknown outbreak of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province.

'888888,0,In China, the number of deaths has increased due to the new Coronavirus. The Health Commission reported 150-new Covid-19 deaths, more than ever in one day. Overall, therefore, 2.592 people died of lung disease in China. In addition, the number of infected by 409 cases increased to more than 77.000.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese authorities have already withdrawn the quarantine of the most severely affected millions of metropolis of Wuhan after a few hours. The easing had been announced "without consent" by a transport committee to local management and therefore "invalid", the city administration announced.\nPreviously it was said that people without a place of residence in the city would now be allowed to leave under certain conditions. It had counted that they showed no possible symptoms of infectious disease and had no contact with Coronavirus patients. It is also reported that people who show compelling reasons for leaving the city could have obtained a travel permit. These reasons include, for example, their reliance on the medical treatment of other diseases outside Wuhan. All persons wishing to leave need official authorization. They should also have registered with the local authorities at their Chinese destinations and had their health monitored for two weeks.\nWuhan is considered the starting point of the epidemic and was on 23rd. In January, the authorities largely sealed off the outside world. However, many foreign nationals have since been returned to their home countries on special flights. For the first time, experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) have visited the citYeah. An international expert group visited two hospitals, the National Health Commission in China announced. One of the clinics had been provisionally set up in a sports centre.\nAccording to the Chinese authorities, the expert group also met the head of the Chinese Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, and other persons responsible for the disease protection of the province of Hubei, in which Wuhan is located. The WHO representatives were reported to have arrived in China more than a week ago.\nAt the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organisation, WHO, the incidence of pneumonia of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).\nSars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 are the same pathogens that infect bats. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, every third party has died of itYeah.\nOverall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.\nMedical practitioners assume that the virus is transmitted from person to person mainly by drip infection.\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nMore than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers suspect roughly somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.\nFollow the progress of registered cases in Germany on this map.\nThe number of infected worldwide tested positive for Corona shows this map from Johns Hopkins University.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO is treating the disease as a pandemic. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.\nTypical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinations. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccination.\nChina\'s head of state and party Xi Jinping spoke the day before of the "biggest health crisis" since the founding of the state 194Yeah. He called for vigorous measures to control the epidemic. After economic life had been severely slowed down or even halted in some places, according to state media reports, the President also called for the slow resumption of work and production, depending on the assessment of health risks on the ground.\nIn regions where the risk is "relatively low", the fight against the virus should focus on preventing its introduction, while production and public life should be restarted. Areas with a "medium risk" should resume work and production depending on the local situation of the epidemic, while regions "with a risk" should continue to focus fully on control and prevention.\nSouth Korea also reported a further spread of the virus. With 161 further confirmed cases, the number of infected people is now in 763 humans. The number of deaths also increased to seven. After China and Japan, South Korea is now the country with the third highest infection rates. The majority of newly reported infections focus on the southeastern millionaire city of Daegu and its surroundings. Previously, the government had issued the highest alert for infectious diseases. Only 129 of the new infections were again counted among members of the Christian sect Shincheonji Church of Jesus. More than half of all cases in the country are those of the sect, which is strongly represented in Daegu.\nIn Europe, Italy is most affected by more than 150 infections and three deaths. On Sunday evening, trains between Italy and Austria were stopped for several hours. Two Eurocities were stopped by the Austrian authorities at the Brenner on their way from Venice to Munich. One of the trains had two German women on board who had fever and severe cougYeah. However, according to the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, they were tested negative in Verona. After that, the 500-passengers were able to continue to Munich.\nIn the north of Italy, several municipalities were sealed off. In the province of Lodi in Lombardy, ten municipalities were declared closed zones, as well as the municipality of Vo in Veneto. Schools, universities and museums remain closed. The carnival in Venice, which was due to end by Tuesday, was also prematurely ended.\nDiseases and deaths have been recorded in more than twenty other countries. Recently, initial infections from Kuwait, Bahrain and Afghanistan have been reported. In Iran, the number of deaths was reported to have increased to twelve.\nBecause of the new Coronavirus, protective masks have been sold out in many pharmacies for weeks, and they are scarcely supplied." There are indeed significant and immediate supply bottlenecks,"said Thomas Porstner, Managing Director of the Federal Association of Wholesale Pharmaceuticals. The increased demand was due to the Coronavirus, according to a spokesman of the German Pharmaceutical Association (ABDA).\nHowever, concrete figures are not available for both associations. At the moment, however, there are only "smallest quantities," Porstner said. Many wholesalers could no longer order goods. When manufacturers can produce enough masks, be unclear.\nBut this was not a cause for panic, the ABDA spokesman said. Healthy people travelling in Germany do not need a mask."A simple mouth-nose protection, as nurses and doctors wear it in surgeries, does not protect against infection with the new virus Sars-CoV-2." It is more a matter of respect for others. They shall be protected from their own germs by the mask.'

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — From Wednesday (Jan 22), the Ministry of Health (MOH) will introduce more precautionary measures in order to reduce the risk of a new coronavirus being imported into Singapore, casting the net wider to isolate more people who may be exposed to the Wuhan virus.  \n In a statement on Tuesday, which came less than 24 hours after it announced that all travellers arriving at Changi Airport on flights from China will have to undergo temperature screening from Wednesday, MOH said that from Wednesday, too, people arriving in Singapore who have pneumonia and developed symptoms within 14 days after travelling to China will be isolated.  \n Those who have acute respiratory infection and developed symptoms within 14 days after being in any hospital in China will also be isolated.  \n These suspected cases will be isolated in hospital as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission. \n Previously, only those who have fever and pneumonia, and developed symptoms within 14 days after travelling to Wuhan in China would be isolated. \n Suspected cases meeting the widened definition will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. \n The authorities in China have confirmed on Monday that the virus can spread from human to human, and the number of pneumonia cases linked to the virus have risen both in China and in other Asian countries. \n The outbreak of the virus was first reported at Wuhan city in the Hubei province of China, and it is believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there that also sells live animals. \n The virus, known as 2019-nCoV, is called a novel (new) coronavirus because it is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, the World Health Organization (WHO) said\n. It is in the same family as the ones that caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), as well as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which killed almost 800 people worldwide from 2002 to 2003, including 33 in Singapore. \n Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Investigations found that the Sars virus was transmitted from civet cats to humans and the one causing Mers was from one-hump camels to humans, WHO said.  \n In rare instances, coronaviruses can evolve and then spread from human to human.  \n TAIWAN SEES FIRST INFECTION \n A panel from WHO will meet in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday to consider whether to declare an international public health emergency over the virus, the way it did with swine flu and Ebola. This could mean a call for a co-ordinated international response to the outbreak. \n Following exported cases in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, Taiwan reported its first confirmed case on Tuesday when a Taiwanese woman returned from Wuhan, had fever, and tested positive for 2019-nCoV. \n Close to 300 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. \n  \n Symptoms of the pneumonia that is linked to the virus include a fever, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, among others. \n At Changi Airport, health advisory posters have been put up to advise all travellers on the precautionary measures to take when travelling to or arriving from Wuhan. \n MOH first started taking precautions since the start of the year, with temperature screening at Changi Airport for travellers arriving on flights from Wuhan, and suspected cases have been referred to hospitals for further assessment. \n SUSPECTED CASES IN SINGAPORE \n As of 3pm on Tuesday, MOH has not been notified of any new cases.  \n The seventh suspected case, a 44-year-old female Singapore resident with pneumonia who had travelled to Wuhan, tested negative for coronavirus, the ministry said\n. \n With medical practitioners being told to look out for pneumonia cases, MOH said that Singapore will likely see more patients who need to be tested because it “cannot rule out the possibility of imported cases”.  \n “To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus reported in Singapore. However, given the high volume of international travel to Singapore, we expect to see more suspected cases, and possibly imported cases,” MOH said.  \n “Once a case is confirmed, contact tracing will be initiated, and we will implement strict isolation, quarantine, and infection control and prevention measures to prevent further transmission,” it added.  \n MOH urges the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene practices.  \n “All travellers to China should monitor their health closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history,” it said.  \n MOH also advised travellers and members of the public to adopt the following precautions at all times: \n Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats \n Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness \n Observe good personal hygiene \n Practise frequent hand-washing with soap, for example, before handling food or eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing \n Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose \n Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately \n Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell. \n TOUR AGENCY TO MONITOR SITUATION \n Travel agency Dynasty Travel told TODAY that it does not offer tours to China until March 2020, which is when the peak travel period usually starts\n.  \n It does not offer tours to Wuhan and the closest tour to Wuhan is Changsha, which is four hours away by coach.  \n Ms Alicia Seah, director of communications at Dynasty Travel, said that Singaporeans tend to avoid the January to February period because the Chinese New Year holidays are quite packed with travellers. \n She added: “We are closely monitoring the situation, and are hopeful that the authorities will handle the situation well. If the situation worsens, we will offer traveling alternatives to our customers or even postpone tours.” \n The travel agency will also be providing N95 masks for customers, avoiding visits to places with live animals, and will not serve meals with raw meat.\n'

Since the company existed,\nWe've never had so many questions. My employees\nThey're all very tired. Me too, I've been getting since the 22nd.

They were buyers from China, they wanted to buy everything I had in stock\nhat. I thought, oh, there must be really bad conditions in Wuhan\nIf the Chinese want to buy bulky goods in Germany, they will rule. I\ndecided spontaneously not to sell everything now, but to sell the goods\ncontrolled release. Our business is not based on one-time buyers.

'888888,0,BEIJING — Under fire for its response to the coronavirus epidemic, China’s authoritarian government appears to be pushing a new account of events that presents President Xi Jinping as taking early action to fight the outbreak that has convulsed the country. \n But in doing so, authorities have acknowledged for the first time that Mr Xi was aware of the epidemic and involved in the response nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it — and while officials at its epicentre in the city of Wuhan were still playing down its dangers. \n That new account risks drawing the president, China’s most powerful leader in decades, directly into questions about whether top officials did too little, too late. \n In an internal speech published Saturday, Mr Xi said he had “issued demands about the efforts to prevent and control” the coronavirus Jan 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest council of the Communist Party, whose sessions are typically cloaked in secrecy. \n In the speech, he also said he had authorised the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning Jan 23. \n “I have at every moment monitored the spread of the epidemic and progress in efforts to curtail it, constantly issuing oral orders and also instructions,” Mr Xi said of his more recent involvement. \n Mr Xi’s advisers may have hoped that publishing the speech, delivered Feb 3, would dispel speculation about his recent retreat from public view and reassure his people that he can be trusted to lead them out of the epidemic. The virus so far has officially infected more than 68,000 people and killed more than 1,650 worldwide, the vast majority in mainland China. \n “The overall tone of the speech appears to be defensive,” said Dr Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. “He wants to change the narrative, which until this point has been very unfavourable to the top leadership.” \n Delivered at a meeting with top party officials, when the epidemic had already spiraled into a national crisis, the speech could expose Mr Xi to criticism that he didn’t treat the initial threat urgently enough and make it difficult for him to shift blame onto local officials for what many see as the government’s early mishandling of the epidemic. \n The remarks also raise questions about what top leaders knew at the time and what instructions they issued based on that knowledge. \n That Mr Xi convened a meeting of China’s highest political body in early January indicates that the coronavirus was already being seen as a matter of high-level concern — making his subsequent silence even more conspicuous, experts said. \n An official account of the Jan 7 Standing Committee meeting issued at the time by Xinhua, the state news agency, made no mention of a discussion of the coronavirus. \n “It seems like he’s trying to indicate that ‘We weren’t asleep at the wheel,’” said Dr Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “But it comes off like, ‘We knew this was a problem, but we weren’t sounding the alarm.’” \n In the speech this month, Mr Xi signaled his displeasure with lower-level bureaucrats for their “shortcomings” in implementing the party’s top-level directives. \n In early January, officials in Wuhan were giving open assurances that human-to-human transmission of the virus was unlikely. Some government experts agreed. \n “For now, it seems there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,” Dr Xu Jianguo, a senior expert on communicable diseases at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview in early January with Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper. “This shows that the threat level from this virus is limited.” \n The new information places Mr Xi’s involvement in fighting the epidemic much earlier than was previously known. His earliest public comment on the epidemic came Jan 20, when he gave brief instructions that were published in state media. \n In the days after Mr Xi’s Jan 7 orders were issued, politicians in Wuhan met for the annual meeting of the city’s People’s Congress, its party-controlled legislature. Over that time, the Wuhan health commission’s daily bulletins on the outbreak said repeatedly that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of human-to-human transmission and no infection of medical workers. \n But signs were growing that politicians and government experts underestimated the potency of the new coronavirus. On Jan 9, a 61-year-old man surnamed Zeng died — the earliest confirmed fatality from the virus. Already, some doctors in Wuhan hospitals were worried enough to warn friends and propose special wards for patients showing symptoms of infection. \n Even after Mr Xi made his first public remarks about the epidemic Jan 20, he mostly kept it at the bottom of his public agenda. On the day before the Chinese New Year holiday began in late January, he took the stage at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and declared his success in guiding China through a difficult year — making no mention of the virus that was already spreading fear throughout the country. \n In the days after, he all but disappeared from public view, emerging only a handful of times to preside over Communist Party meetings and to meet foreign visitors, including the director-general of the World Health Organization and Cambodia’s autocratic leader, Mr Hun Sen. \n In the meantime, he directed China’s No. 2 leader, Mr Li Keqiang, to lead the group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the response. \n For days, Mr Xi’s absence from public view fueled speculation that he was trying to shield his own reputation by taking a back seat in the fast-unfolding crisis. In the past week, he has returned to centre stage in an apparent effort to swat away such talk. \n This past week, Mr Xi went to a neighbourhood centre in Beijing, a hospital and a centre for disease control in what state media billed as a visit to the “front line” of China’s efforts to combat the epidemic. He has yet to visit Hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic. \n A few days later, Mr Xi fired two top Communist Party officials in Hubei, a move intended to calm simmering public anger and contain the political fallout. \n By publishing the Feb 3 speech now, experts said, Mr Xi appears to be staking his reputation on the outcome of the epidemic fight. \n “What’s really interesting in the speech is, there’s a lot of the word ‘I’ in it,” said Dr Blanchette, of Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “This is clearly putting himself at the centre of Beijing’s response to this while also falling back on the old excuse of blaming cadres for long-standing pathologies of China’s political system.” \n The Feb 3 speech was published by Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, the Communist Party’s top doctrinal journal. It is rare for such an internal speech to be published in full so quickly. THE NEW YORK TIMES \n '

'888888,0,Friday, Spanish citizens, Danes and Norwegians evacuated from China because of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV Wuhan arrive in Madrid to spend 14 days in quarantine in the Gómez Ulla military hospital in the capital. Two weeks of isolation will only be preventive, since they have no symptoms, as noted by Bethlehem Padilla, assistant doctor of the Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the Gregorio Maranon hospital and vice president of the Medical Association of Madrid: "There are sick. They are people who have been in an area with coronavirus, but have no symptoms. Quarantine is to monitor only ".\nAlso emphasizes that the Health Minister Enrique Ruiz Escudero: "There are considered and patients. They were in the region and are therefore potential candidates, but nothing more. Are asymptomatic and, if they had any symptoms, had been unable to travel. "He explains to the phone when they arrive in Madrid will be another test and then go to" normal to pass that preventive quarantine hospital. "\nWhile the trip was being prepared, a few hours ago, the Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the international emergency outbreak to launch a "global action" to contain the advance of the virus and, community, the Ministry of Health established a protocol sent to all hospitals in the region to handle, if any, to patients suspected of infection with this virus. The alarm landing the plane can generate citizenship is normal -for the novelty of the virus- but lacking arguments. Dr. Padilla explains why.\nIs there a risk of contagion in Madrid?\nThe risk is now none, because there is no case in Spain. Although it seems a very transmissible virus [it has had a rapid spread], can only happen if you have traveled to that particular area of \u200b\u200bChina or had contact with people who have done it. But today the risk is zero.\nIs it advisable to take precautions?\nCurrently we do not have to do anything other than be aware of new information that gives the Ministry of Health and follow their recommendations as well as those published by the Community of Madrid. No need to go to pharmacies for masks or we use alcohol hand sanitizer for all and everywhere. We must take the same precautions apply with influenza or other viruses that visit us every year, for example, never coughing into hands, but in a handkerchief and then discarded or elbow.\nHow Madrid is ready to meet the arrival of evacuated citizens?\nTranquility has to be high, public health in Spain and Madrid is excellent, with excellent services microbiology and large hospitals that offer services where you can do the test for the virus if necessary, though, for now who has officially confirmed any suspicions is the National Microbiology Center (CNM) in Majadahonda.\nWhat if a case appeared in the Community?\nAlso tranquility would have to be absolute. We have two hospitals with isolation units, La Paz-Carlos III and Gómez Ulla military hospital, where patients could be. So far this untreatable virus, nor have many other viruses, and what they need are good supportive care. Oxygen in case of pneumonia, for example, or good intensive care services. Hospitals are putting up multidisciplinary teams to adopt the measures of the protocol of the Community of Madrid, formed by emergency physicians, preventive, microbiology, infectious and medical UVI.\nThe protocol to which Dr. Padilla refers establishes guidelines for handling possible cases when symptoms give the Ministry of Health has collected into a document. "The most common include cough, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, a major difficulty breathing, kidney failure and even death. The most serious cases usually occur in elderly or suffering from some other disease such as of the heart, lung or immune problems. " Although not yet known precisely how the infection occurs, the most accepted form is through contact and by droplets expelled to coughing.\nThe document states that "in the first contact with patients who come to hospital emergency" is necessary to ask if you have traveled to the province of Hubei in China, in the 14 days before the onset of symptoms or has been in contact with a probable or confirmed case of 2019-nCoV.

"888888,0,Indian benchmark equity indices on Thursday collapsed once again as Sensex fell over 2,500 points while Nifty was down over 760 points or over seven per cent. The stock market shock comes a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.\nAs far as domestic stock markets are concerned, the freefall has led to a significant rise in the volatility index, which indicates that investors still remain worried about the prevailing economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nHere are key factors which led to the bloodbath on D-Street on Thursday:\nCoronavirus now a pandemic\nThe coronavirus is now a pandemic, declared WHO on Thursday. The development was announced by WHO in view of the rapid rise in Covid-19 infections around the globe. Declaring it as a pandemic triggered a massive slump in stock markets across the world. Asian, European and US market indices took a pounding as investors remain spooked. The US has suspended travel from Europe while India has suspended all tourist visa till April 15.\nIn the morning trade, aviation and tourism stocks plummeted sharply after as a result of the fresh restrictions on travel.\nIt is worth mentioning that the WHO has declared the novel coronavirus as a pandemic and added that Italy and Iran were the hotspot countries. It said other countries could join them soon.\nThe WHO declared the new coronavirus as a pandemic for the first time on Wednesday, adding that Italy and Iran were now on the frontline of the disease and other countries would soon join them. The global toll death toll has crossed 4,500 while India has recorded at least 73 positive cases.\nOil slides further\nAnother reason why domestic stock markets fell was a further slide in global crude oil prices. Oil prices have continued to slide since the major crash on March 6 following a meeting of the OPEC countries and Russia. A price war was triggered as Saudi slashed oil prices, resulting in the collapse of global crude oil prices.\nWhile prices had recovered slightly on March 11, the lower prices keep hurting sentiments of major oil companies in the country. Power and energy companies are also taking a pounding in the domestic stock market due to reduced prices. Though the general notion is that India benefits from any cut in global crude prices, the recent deep cut may not be ideal for the country.\nSharp fall in oil prices also has a greater impact on the equity market, as witnessed in the past few days. It could even disrupt the flow for foreign capital into the India market if crude prices keep falling.\nGlobal market rout\nNot just India but markets around the globe have witnessed carnage over the past few days due to the coronavirus outbreak. From Dow Jones in the US to other major markets in the world, each one has registered serious falls due to rising doubts over the total financial impact of the virus outbreak.\nStock markets around the world crumbled after Trump's move, with U.S. stock index futures diving 4.7% and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbling 4.1% to its lowest level since early 2019.\nAs the virus keeps spreading across the globe rapidly, analysts expect the carnage to continue until there is a global decline in new positive cases.\nInvestors will also be monitoring the situation in China, which conveyed that the number of cases in the epicentre Hubei province and Wuhan reduced significantly.\n"
'888888,0,Japan is still preparing to host the Olympics, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Saturday, despite rising global concern about the viability of the summer Games due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nAbe and his government have been adamant the Olympics will go ahead, even as other global sporting events have been put on hold. Speculation about a delay from the July start date has grown since U.S. President Donald Trump said organisers should consider a one-year postponement.\nAbe and Trump held a call after those comments, prompting the U.S. president to say on Twitter that the Olympic venue was magnificent. But this may not be enough to assuage sponsors of the Games, who are increasingly nervous about how the impact of the outbreak on the competition.\nThe Olympic Torch relay, in which the Olympic flame typically starts a tour around the host nation, is due to start in the Japanese prefecture of Fukushima in less than two weeks. The tour of the torch through Greece has already been cut short.\n"We will overcome the spread of the infection and host the Olympics without problem, as planned," Abe told a news conference in Tokyo, adding that delaying or cancelling the Olympics was "not a subject at all" in his call with Trump.\nHe said Japan working closely with the International Olympic Committee, which will have the final decision whether the Games go ahead, and the U.N. World Health Organization, suggesting he accepted that Tokyo would not ultimately decide on the event.\nHe said Japan had a relatively low infection rate and had not seen an explosion in cases as seen in South Korea, China, Italy, Iran and elsewhere. He said delaying the peak of infections was vital to ensure treatment of those in critical condition.\nTORCH RELAY\nAbe said Japan did not need to declare a national emergency, although parliament on Friday approved a bill to give him emergency powers and allow him to close schools, halt large gatherings and requisition medical supplies.\nTokyo Governor Yuriko Koike promised thorough measures against the coronavirus outbreak and said preparations for a "safe and secure" Games were progressing, TV Asahi reported.\nGreece\'s Olympic Committee cancelled on Friday the remainder of the Olympic Torch relay through Greece to avoid attracting crowds, while the relay through Japan is scheduled to start on March 26.\nJapan had 21 new coronavirus cases as of Saturday evening, bringing the total 1,443, public broadcaster NHK reported, while the has killed 28 people in Japan.\nThe total infections included 697 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and 14 returnees on chartered flights from China, according to NHK. Japan\'s fatalities included those from the ship.\n'
'888888,0,In a matter of days, millions of Americans have seen their lives upended by measures to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\nNormally bustling streets are deserted as families hunker down in their homes. Many of those who do venture out try to stay a safe distance from anyone they encounter, even as they line up to buy now-precious commodities like hand sanitizer. Parents juggle childcare as schools close, perhaps for the rest of the school year. And restaurants and bars sit empty as more and more convert to delivery-only options.\nHow long will this last? Scientists say there isn\'t a simple answer.\n"In many ways, this situation is unprecedented - we\'re trying to take some actions to curb the spread and timing of this pandemic," said Stephen Morse, a disease researcher at Columbia University in New York.\nYes, there have been past disease outbreaks that scientists can draw some lessons from but, in those cases, the disease was largely allowed to run its course. "So those models don\'t precisely apply," Morse said.\nMONTHS-LONG BATTLE\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. may be managing the outbreak through July or August. And New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state\'s number of coronavirus cases may peak - not end - in 45 days.\nThe overall message is that the country will be fighting the virus outbreak for a matter of months, at least, not days or weeks.\nEach model of how the disease could spread relies on data and assumptions about population dynamics, demographics, health care capacity and other factors, said Rebecca Katz, a public health expert at Georgetown University.\nThe challenge for designing models of what will happen next in the U.S. is that limited testing for COVID-19 means researchers don\'t know what the starting point is - how many people are already infected.\nIn simplest terms, scientists say that the epidemic will slow when people with infections don\'t pass the virus on to others.\n"Basically, if I infect one other person or more ... then the epidemic can take off. If I infect less than one person and everybody infects less than one person, then the epidemic will decline," said Elizabeth Halloran, a disease researcher at the University of Washington.\nBased on data from China and from cruise ships, scientists estimate that unless measures are taken to limit the spread, each infected person will infect about 2 or 3 others, leading to an exponential growth of the virus.\nIf the virus makes a jump to new person every two to five days, as scientists calculate, then a single infected person could lead to 4,142 total infections within a month - assuming nothing is done to break chains of transmission.\nUnless such measures are put in place, scientists estimate that between 40 and 80% of the global population could become infected. Based on an analysis of data from China, scientists found that the majority of new infections are transmitted by people with mild symptoms who may not even know they\'re ill, said Jeffrey Shaman, a public health expert at Columbia University.\nEven if most people recover and only a fraction of total infections are severe enough to require hospitalization - about 14%, scientists estimate - the sheer scale of the epidemic will put enormous strain on hospitals, healthcare workers and other patients who may see unrelated procedures delayed.\nScientists now agree that measures to break or slow the chains of transmission are crucial to ensure that emergency rooms aren\'t quickly overwhelmed by surges in critically ill patients.\nIf measures like closing schools are successful in slowing disease spread, "we are going to see a hump instead of a peak" in new cases, U.S. government disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a White House briefing.\nIn order words, the number of infections will rise more gradually and manageably. But that also means the duration of the outbreak will be prolonged.\n"The point of the restrictions we have is actually to stretch this out even longer. We don\'t want a big peak to come very quickly," said Mark Jit, a disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "It\'s not like a Hollywood movie with a clear ending where everyone is saved, or everyone dies, quickly."\nHOW DOES THIS END?\nMost scientists believe the fight against COVID-19 won\'t be over until there\'s an effective vaccine. But Fauci and other experts say it will be more than a year before a vaccine can be ready for widespread use.\n"The best-case scenario is that we have vaccine in 12 or 18 months and then our lives go back to normal," Jit said. "The worst-case scenario it takes a long time for a vaccine to be developed, and the world is really changed and our lives aren\'t the same again."\nWhile we wait, are we all shut-ins for more than a year? Almost no one thinks that\'s realistic.\n"I don\'t think we can maintain social distancing as it is right now for the duration of the epidemic," said Michael Levy, a University of Pennsylvania disease researcher.\nWhat may be more feasible is a plan for intermittent restrictions and enhanced monitoring to control the disease, an idea explored in a new study from researchers at Imperial College London. Once the number of new cases falls below a certain threshold, schools, offices and restaurants could reopen. But if the number of infections spikes again, restrictions would be reinstated.\n"The analogy of pumping car brakes on an icy road is what we should be thinking about," Levy said. "You push on the brakes to slow things down, then ease up - but if you skid, you have to pump the brakes again."\n'

Cases of infection have also been reported in Japan, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the United States and Viet Nam.\nFor information on the most dangerous infectious diseases, tasis provides.\nPlague\nPlague ( Rodents (Yersinia pestics) and fleas living in them have been found in small animals since 1894. It is transmitted to people through the bite of contaminated fleas, direct contact with infected materials or through air drops. The incubation period is 3-7 days, and then develops into typical symptoms of influenza: sudden rise in body temperature, chills, headaches, body aches, weakness, nausea, vomiting. There are three forms of plague. In bubonna, the most common form of plague, the bacterium is the lymphatic system. As a result, the lymph nodes become hard and have nodules on the body. In the later stages of the disease, inflammatory lymph nodes become festering wounds. In the case of sepsis, the infection passes through cracks in the skin and immediately enters the bloodstream.\nAbout The lungs - the most severe and the least common plague - are accompanied by damage to respiratory organs. Without treatment, the disease can lead to serious complications and death)（ In the fight against plague, the effective treatment of antibiotics and maintenance therapy. If not treated, the disease can lead to death in the short term.\nThe early signs of diseases with similar symptoms are Roman times. However, it is believed that it also spread early in modern Libya, Syria and Egypt. In the past, the plague caused a large epidemic. The fourteenth chapter According to some reports, a plague known as "Black Death" claimed 50 million lives. According to the World Health Organization (who), 3000 people were registered between 2010 and 2015. 248 cases of different forms of plague, 584 people died of disease.\nsmallpox\nSmallpox is caused by smallpox virus) Variola. It is spread by air, as well as by contact with objects of infected persons. 2. Incubation period - 7 to 17 days. The disease begins with a sharp rise in temperature, headache, and often nausea and vomiting. 2-3 days later, the temperature drops, and the skin and mucus show nodules - blister rash, leaving scars) [semen]\nAbout In 30% of cases, death is fatal, a rare form)（\nUntil recently, it was thought that smallpox appeared in Africa or Asia in 4000 BC. Um... Today, however, scientists believe that the human virus is close to the camel pox virus and spread in the Middle East at the beginning of our time. For the first time, smallpox spread to the fourth B and the sixth B in China. I hit Korea. The eighth chapter Diseases were introduced into Europe in the late 17th and 18th centuries. The epidemic affects almost all of Europe\'s population, with more than 1.5 million people dying each year; in Russia, it has the highest incidence, at 18.8 per cent. At the beginning of the 16th century For the first time, smallpox was mentioned in the United States, where Spanish conquistadors might bring it. At the end of the eighteenth session Smallpox was shipped to Australia.\nThe WHO global vaccination programme has been successful in combating the disease since the second half of the 1960s. A recent case of smallpox was found in Somalia on 26 October 1997. The fight against the disease was officially announced in 1980. Only two laboratories - the Russian National Science Center - have the right to preserve the virus and conduct research.

Transmission through contaminated water and food is closely related to poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water. From ancient times to the middle of the 20th century, cholera was widely known. It remains one of the most dangerous epidemics. (thousands of US dollars) Cholera has spread from the pristine reservoirs of the Ganghe Delta in India to all over the world. Six successive pandemics have claimed the lives of millions of people around the world. The seventh outbreak began in South Asia in 1961, spread to Africa in 1971 and to the Americas in 1991. At present, there are some cases and outbreaks in developing countries and poor countries, especially in large-scale natural disasters. For example, in the wake of the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January 2010, the cholera outbreak killed more than 7500 people. Cholera moved from Haiti to the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Spain, the United States and Venezuela in January 2011, and to Cuba in 2012.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, between 3 and 5 million cholera cases occur every year, of which more than 100000 people die. - death.\nAbout To prevent the disease, two vaccines were used. They provide more than 50 per cent of sustainable protection in two years.\nswine flu\n"Swine flu") In Mexico and the United States, it\'s the name of a human viral infection that first spread in pig homes. The virus is transmitted through the home and air drip and causes typical symptoms of influenza and respiratory infections - cough, headache, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, cold. The most dangerous complication is pneumonia. " Swine flu "is the most common type A influenza, and combines the most common subtypes H1N1), H1N2, H3N1, H3N2 and h2n3. The most reliable way to avoid swine flu infection is seasonal vaccination.\nBetween 1957 and 1958, the H2N2 virus triggered the pandemic, when 20 to 50 per cent of the world\'s population was affected and 1 to 4 million people died, most of them children. Another pathogen, the H3N2 virus, caused an epidemic in 1968-1969, with the first cases found in Hong Kong. Global diseases have claimed 4 million lives. During 2009-2010, the H1N1 outbreak rate was very high. According to the World Health Organization, at that time, the pandemic affected 30 per cent of the population in 214 countries, killing more than 18000 people.

At that time, more than 500 million people were ill and 20 to 50 million died. This is the largest epidemic in human history.\nEbola\nDiseases caused by Ebola virus) affect people and some animals. The virus was first found in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1976, in a village along the Ebola River, so it is called. It is believed that the virus was initially carried by bats. It is transmitted from wild animals to humans through mucosal or skin damage. The symptoms were fever, jaundice, hemorrhage and renal failure. The incubation period varies from 2 to 21 days. During the outbreak, the death rate reached 90%. The experts are divided into five viruses: bundibudjio（\nFever broke out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1976, 1995 and 2007, in the Sudan in 1976, in Uganda in 2000 and in the Republic of the Congo in 2003. In 2013-2016, outbreaks in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia resulted in the highest number of deaths.\nAbout Cases have also been reported in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom, Italy and the United States. According to the World Health Organization, about 30000 people have been infected since the beginning of the epidemic. The world population is about 130 million, with 11300 deaths. Human beings. During 2018-2019, there were 34000 intermittent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 2000 Dead\nAIDS\nAcquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease that develops when people are infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The virus affects the immune system and weakens the protection of the body from infection and disease. HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact, blood transfusion, the use of infected needles or sharp tools, and from mothers during pregnancy and childbirth. And breastfeeding. Aids can develop within two to 15 years of infection. There is no cure for HIV infection. However, antiretroviral therapy can control, prevent the spread of the virus and reduce its damage to the human body.\nSome scholars believe that HIV was transmitted from monkeys to humans as early as the 1920s. The first victim of the disease is said to be a man who died in Congo in 1959. Symptoms of HIV infection were first reported in the United States in June 1981.\nAbout In 1983, researchers in the United States and France described a virus that could cause HIV / AIDS.\nAccording to the joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS (UNAIDS), in 2018, there were about 37.9 million people living with HIV worldwide, 1.7 million of whom were children under the age of 15. The most disadvantaged areas are eastern and southern Africa, where there are about 20.6 million infected people. The number of new HIV infections decreased by 40 per cent from its peak in 1997, from 2.9 million to 1.7 million. In Russia, from the discovery of the first AIDS case in 1987 to 30 June 2019, 1.38 million Russian citizens were registered with HIV, of whom 335000 died. 867 people.\ncoronavirus\nCoronavirus is a kind of virus, belonging to the coronaviridae subsystem of the coronaviridae family. These diseases were first discovered in the 1960s and are the cause of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in humans and animals. There are 39 coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome, also known as SARS, is an acute infectious respiratory disease, It is characterized by rapid development and a mortality rate of about 10%.\nAbout The incubation period between infection and symptoms is usually 10 days. The disease starts at temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius), fever, chills, headaches and muscle aches. After 3-7 days, the stage of respiratory deterioration began. The disease is spread through air droplets and contact lifestyle.\nIn November 2002, acute respiratory infection broke out for the first time in Guangdong Province, southern China. Since then, many cases have been reported in China, New Zealand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. In addition to Asian countries, SARS has also been registered in North America and Europe. Only one case is recorded in Russia)（ According to who data, the total number of cases in 37 countries worldwide reached 8000 in the period 2002-2003. 437 people died, more than 800 of them.\nThe Middle East respiratory syndrome was discovered in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread to other countries in the Middle East. In a version of the World Health Organization, camels are carriers of the virus. The manifestations of BVS are similar to that of common influenza: hyperthermia, cough, dyspnea, general discomfort, diarrhea. Incubation period 7 to 14 days\nAbout According to statistics, it is rarely transmitted to children. Children under 14 account for 3% of all cases The mortality rate is 35-40%. More than 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, China and the United States, reported cases during 2012-2015. Since September 2012, more than 1.3 million people worldwide have died of malaria, according to who. Laboratory confirmed cases of infection, including more than 460 deaths. Patients with successful coronavirus infection were treated with plasma.\n'
"888888,1,In January 30th, the WHO launched the new contagion of the new coronavirus as an international public health emergency. At the same time, it expressed confidence in the ability of China to control the epidemic. With more and more cases in China showing the spread of the epidemic, more and more countries are affected, including Russia and other multinational governments taking measures to close the border, the United States, the United Kingdom and France and other airlines have taken grounded flights, and some countries have begun to withdraw overseas Chinese.\nA Agence France-Presse reporter saw a white haired man wearing a mask and a more than 60 year old man who appeared to be on the street in Wuhan on January 30th. He suddenly fell dead and was holding a shopping bag. Wuhan used to be crowded with people. Now there are few pedestrians on the street. No one dares to approach the man who died on the side of the road.\nMedical staff and some onlookers were worried, and the atmosphere in the whole city of Wuhan was scared. The reporter reported that the Sixth Hospital of Wuhan is one of the main medical centers for the treatment of pneumonia patients in Wuhan. It is full of people waiting for examination.\nThe Chinese authorities have taken unprecedented measures to block the city, blocking roads and flights, and trying to stop the spread of the virus.\nFrench historian and Chinese expert Francois gudeming, now an Asia consultant at the University of Montaigne in France, said it was true that the Chinese government delayed acknowledging the outbreak and drew criticism. It is true that the Chinese government has not invested enough in public health, such as the lack of hospitals and freelance doctors. In the second stage, the Chinese government took urgent measures. Although it made life inconvenient for the local people, there was no other way. The Chinese government has taken relatively strict measures to control the spread of the epidemic to other countries.\nFor criticizing the lack of transparency of the Chinese government in dealing with the crisis, Gu Deming believes that it is true that the initial stage of the outbreak was like this. Although the central government was not completely transparent in dealing with the epidemic since January 20, especially in how to find the origin of the virus, there was little information from the outside world. At present, the Chinese government has not cooperated with the outside world, but it has improved compared with the outbreak of SARS in 2003 Time has improved. We can see some English articles published by Chinese criticizing the government's slow action. In addition, we can use wechat to report local officials' concealment of the epidemic, showing some changes.\nThe current situation is that China's new coronavirus can be transmitted to humans rapidly, and the number of cases is faster than that of 2003 SARS virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n。\nBut the initial symptoms of SARS are high fever and dry cough, which lead to dyspnea. In a few days, severe patients need artificial oxygen to survive. The latent period of the new coronavirus is almost asymptomatic.\nWuhan is suffering from severe pneumonia. The first French evacuation plane from Wuhan arrived at the southern isolation resort in France on Friday, and the second French evacuation plane arrived at home on Sunday.\nGerman Foreign Minister Maas said the German government on Friday sent a military aircraft to Wuhan, China, to withdraw more than 100 German citizens from the area hit by the virus, while providing the Chinese government with short supplies such as masks and 10000 sets of protective clothing.\n"

CCDC has mapped all 72,314 confirmed and suspected cases of coronavirus till February 11.\nThe study found that the death rate due to coronavirus is higher in men compared to women. The fatality rate in men is 2.8 per cent - one per cent higher than women.\nMost victims were also found to have a pre-existing disease. Researchers found that patients of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases have got easily infected by COVID-19. According to the study, more than 80 per cent of the cases are mild, and the rest are critical.\nAlso, it has been seen that the death rate due to coronavirus rises with increase in age group. Zero deaths have been recorded in the age group of 0-9, while the 80+ age group registered 14.8 per cent fatality rate.\nThe number of new cases and deaths are on the decline, with figures having dropped to a three-week low. On February 17, a total of 2,003 confirmed cases were reported - the lowest since January 30.\nIndia Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) also found a dip in the number of daily casualties due to coronavirus. The daily death count has dropped 31 per cent in the last two days.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) remains cautious. "It\'s too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table. Trends can change as new populations are affected," said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Geneva, Switzerland.\nAfter observing the data, the WHO chief said COVID-19 is not as deadly as other coronaviruses, including those causing SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome).\nAt present, a 12-member WHO team is in China for field inspections.

'888888,0,LONDON (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was “too early” to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.\n'

"888888,0,There are almost two dozen confirmed fatalities of the new coronavirus detected in December in China. The number of infected is estimated to be over four thousand and the international community is taking steps to prevent the epidemic from becoming a pandemic.\nPortugal already has three preventive hospitals, two in Lisbon (Curry Cabral and Stephania) and one in Porto (St John). It will be in these units, in principle, that any persons in which the virus is detected will be admitted. A relatively remote hypothesis, but not inconceivable.\nThe original outbreak started in a shellfish and animal market in Wuhan, a Chinese town of 11 million inhabitants. The animal that gave rise to it is not yet known, although initial investigations seem to point to snakes and bats. The Express spoke to Celso Cunha, director of the medical microbiology unit at the Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine at the New University of Lisbon, to better understand the extent of the problem.\nWhat is the real risk now in Portugal? The real risk to the countries of Europe at the moment is considered low. Also in Portugal. There are some European airports that have direct flights to Wuhan, the region where the virus was detected. Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, Rome, Istanbul, and Moscow too, unless I make a mistake. There appears to have been no cases in Europe from people who have travelled to that region. However, it is necessary, in my opinion, to keep an eye on travel not only to China but also to other countries where confirmed cases have also been detected: Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Macao, in particular.\nWhen a traveler arrives from Wuhan, what happens at the five airports you mentioned? Is the person tested? Not right now, as far as I know.\nYeah. In the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom measures are being considered at airports, some sort of screening of travellers coming from these areas, but I still do not know exactly what will be implemented. I know that the measures are being taken seriously, especially as a case has already been detected in the United States.\nWhat kind of measures are we talking about, and how would people be selected? Is it someone who had those symptoms that have been described as fever or difficulty breathing? Someone who travels on the plane with those symptoms and manifests them on arrival. When the SARS epidemic occurred, where there was also a coronavirus in China that initially caused an outbreak, which became an epidemic and then a pandemic, there were about nine thousand cases and about eight hundred, nine hundred deaths, almost ten per cent of mortality. At that time, measures were implemented that experienced triage of people with symptoms of some fever and a malaise compatible with a coronavirus diagnosis.\nIt is clear that most people who come with these symptoms are probably not infected with any coronavirus, but with another virus or bacterium that also causes these symptoms, similar to those of the flu virus. Depending on their severity, prior screening may or may not be advisable. And if the person is infected, refer them to health services.\nIs that from the airport? At the airport, it's not easy to diagnose. We may eventually have specialized personnel who can detect a suspicion. But not the diagnosis.\nHow is the diagnosis done? It can be done by harvesting nasal discharge. From there, the genome of the virus can be extracted. In this case, a genome composed of an RNA molecule, not DNA. It is a slightly different nucleic acid than DNA that is part of the genetic heritage of our cells.\nYeah. Although we also have lots of RNA in our system, but with other functions.\nThe genetic information of these viruses is contained in this RNA molecule, which is slightly different from DNA. What you do in the diagnosis is amplify this RNA by a reaction similar to what you do to amplify DNA, to detect it. Since Chinese scientists have already published the complete sequence of this coronavirus, it was possible to develop a test based on this PCR sequence, or polymerase chain reaction. With specific reagents, we can amplify only what interests us; in this case, the genome of the virus. If we can amplify it, we have a positive result.\nThis test can't be done at the airport. It has to be done in a lab. It doesn't take long, no more than four, five hours.\nIs the test already available all over the world? Yes,ma'am. Not commercially, but there are already guidelines from the European Center for Disease Control and the American CDC that indicate the protocol to be used.\nTherefore, in Portugal there are already ways, if a suspicious case arises, to make this test. -Absolutely. Any medium-sized diagnostic laboratory equipped shall be able to carry out the test.\nThose two viruses that were talked about a long time ago, SARS and MERS, had no cases detected in Portugal as far as I know, there were no such cases in Portugal. I could be wrong.\nThat it was reported, there wasn't. And a lot of people have a certain idea that these far-off diseases don't get here, they get here. Just like ours come to other places. People travel... Remember the Asian flu, last century. In two years, it spread from Asia around the world and killed tens of millions of people. There was also Spanish flu in 1918. At a time when there were no modes of transport today, a hundred million people have died all over the world in two years.\nYeah.\nSpeaking of SARS and MERS, why were there no cases in Portugal? Was it a question of luck or statistics? It is probably because very rapid preventive measures have been taken that have not been taken in other cases. By contrast, 1918 didn't even know it was a virus. Public health measures will not have been the most appropriate.\nThe new virus, as far as anyone knows, is less serious than the other two we talked about. So far, yes. We have 17 dead and five hundred and such cases confirmed. After all, it's four percent mortality. High rate for a respiratory infection. I know that the dead have been mainly older people, the older with 89, the younger with 48, and with other complications, such as diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson's, liver cirrhosis, other associated pathologies. These people were most vulnerable, and they were the first victims. Healthy people, young people, are more likely to survive and this will pass with mild symptoms, as if it were a common cold.\n"

'888888,0,SAN ANTONIO, Texas/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said on Wednesday that the United States would have to be tolerant if the fast-spreading coronavirus impaired China’s ability to increase purchases of American farm products under the countries’ recently signed trade deal.\nChina, in the initial deal signed Jan. 15, promised to buy at least an additional $12.5 billion worth of U.S. farm products in 2020 and at least $19.5 billion in 2021 over the 2017 level of $24 billion.\nCommodity traders and agricultural economists have questioned whether Beijing will follow through on pledges in the deal to buy $36.5 billion of U.S. agricultural goods in 2020, now that the new coronavirus is threatening China’s economic growth.\n“If they’re really trying and it really just blows the economy out of the water, then we would have to be understanding of that,” Perdue said, speaking to reporters at a cattle convention in Texas.\nPerdue noted he is not part of the government team tasked with enforcing the terms of the deal.

'888888,0,PARIS/WASHINGTON - Business activity collapsed from Australia, Japan and Western Europe to the United States at a record pace in March as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic hammer the world economy, cementing economists\' views of a deep global recession.  \n The highly contagious coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.  \n "The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy," said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan. "However, a wise policy coordination between health and fiscal authorities should allow a V-shaped recovery once containment measures are relaxed."  \n Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to a reading of 40.5 this month. That was an all-time low and followed a reading of 49.6 in February.  \n Last month\'s decline in the index, which is seen as a good measure of economic health, was the largest in the series\' history. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in business activity. The survey underscored the rapidly deteriorating economy, highlighted last week by a government report showing the biggest rise since 2012 in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits during the week ended March 14.  \n Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when data for last week is published on Thursday.  \n The message was equally grim from the 19 countries that use the euro. IHS Markit\'s flash composite PMI for the euro zone plummeted to a record low of 31.4 in March.  \n That was by far the biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of 38.8.  \n In France, services activity fell to a record low and manufacturing saw its steepest drop since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.  \n A PMI for the services sector in Germany, Europe\'s largest economy, showed a record contraction in activity, while sister surveys showed Britain\'s economy shrinking at a record pace.  \n IHS Markit said the March figures suggested the euro zone economy was shrinking at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus could steepen the downturn.  \n With most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot. But some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial.  \n There was some optimism on that front, with senior Democrats and Republicans saying on Tuesday they were close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to aid the U.S. economy.  \n Hopes for a large fiscal stimulus sparked a sharp rebound in global stock markets, with the Dow Jones <.DJI> raking up its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933. (Graphic: Coronavirus pandemic hits global business - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3868/3829/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES  \n After an initial outbreak in China brought the world\'s second-largest economy to a virtual halt last month, an ever-growing number of countries and territories have reported a spike in infections and deaths, leading to "social distancing" policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.  \n Goldman Sachs is predicting that the global economy will shrink 1.0% this year, with gross domestic product in China estimated to contract at a 42% annualised rate in the first quarter and GDP in the United States dropping at a record 24% rate in the April-June period.  \n "The coronacrisis has pushed the world economy into a deep recession," said Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius. "The response to that crisis represents a physical constraint on economic activity that is unprecedented in postwar history."  \n The bleak U.S. economic picture ahead of the November presidential election has prompted President Donald Trump to push for businesses to reopen by Easter. Given rising infections and death toll, health experts, economists and politicians have cautioned against such a move, which they say could backfire, with Americans remaining fearful of going out.  \n Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with major Wall Street investors on Tuesday.  \n "Sending the public back to work at this time would be premature," said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. "The U.S. is better off taking a one-time hit to economic growth, as efforts to terminate the virus continue, rather than run the risk of multiple economic shutdowns." (Graphic: U.S. stocks have fallen hard - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3867/3828/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of dollar funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers.  \n PMI surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade.  \n This was consistent with a 4% contraction in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world\'s third-largest economy.  \n The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding and an array of programs to help keep companies afloat. For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and "soon" will roll out a programme to get credit to small and medium-sized businesses. It will also expand its asset purchases by "as much as needed."  \n The Fed last week slashed borrowing costs to zero and took other emergency steps to keep the commercial paper, U.S. Treasury debt and foreign dollar funding markets functional.  \n G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on Tuesday pledged to expand fiscal and monetary actions for as long as necessary to restore growth and confidence.  \n With the International Monetary Fund predicting a global recession, the world\'s 20 largest economies agreed on Monday to develop an "action plan," but without specifics.

'888888,0,BEIJING (Reuters) - China has ordered airlines to sharply cut the number of flights in and out of the country out of concern that travelers from overseas could reignite the coronavirus outbreak that paralyzed the country for two months.\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said on Thursday it had directed Chinese airlines to maintain only one route to any country and limit the number of flights to one per week, effective March 29.\nThe authority also ordered foreign airlines to reduce their international routes to China to one per week and only operate one route into the country.\n“In accordance with the need for epidemic containment, CAAC may issue policy to further reduce the total number of international passenger flights,” the regulator said in a statement.\nAround 80% of international flights were already being canceled prior to the announcement, but Chinese airlines had been asked not to cut their international routes until Thursday’s order by the CAAC.\nChina also will temporarily suspend the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas and residence permits starting on March 28, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.\nThe moves, in conjunction with severe quarantine rules now being imposed on people arriving in the country, are set to slow the flow of inbound travelers to a trickle.\nBeijing is keen to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic that emerged in the Hubei region’s capital Wuhan in late 2019 and has killed nearly 3,300 Chinese citizens to date and more than 21,000 people globally.\nSevere curbs on travel and transport brought the epidemic under control in China but at a heavy price, with some analysts expecting an outright contraction for the country’s economy in the first quarter. Beijing is exhorting industries to reopen, but the virus, which has now spread around the globe, continues to threaten China’s economy and the health of its people.\nMainland China has not seen any new locally transmitted coronavirus cases in six of the past eight days, shifting the focus to preventing infected people arriving from overseas from triggering a fresh outbreak in the country. All 67 new cases reported by the end of Wednesday were imported, as were all 47 reported the previous day, the National Health Commission said earlier on Thursday, putting the total number of confirmed cases to date at 81,285.\nThe commission reported a total of 3,287 deaths by the end of Wednesday, up six from the previous day.\nHubei, home to some 60 million people, reported no new cases on Wednesday and opened its borders.\nThe lockdown of Hubei’s capital Wuhan, where the virus first appeared late last year, will be lifted on April 8, a milestone in China’s war against the epidemic.\nAbout 90% of all the imported cases are Chinese passport holders, Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui told a press conference, adding that 40% of those were overseas Chinese students returning amid rising infections abroad.\n“We understand some overseas students are eager to come home...But under the current circumstances, by staying put, they can avoid being cross-infected in the hurried journey home or getting stuck mid-journey when the countries they transit in tighten border controls,” Luo said.\nShanghai will make every international traveler arriving from 6 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) on Thursday go into quarantine for 14 days, the local government announced.\nIt had previously only required this for travelers who had visited any of 24 badly-hit countries in the previous two weeks.\n'
'888888,0,HUBEI — These days, Ms Chloe Chang, a Taiwanese woman stranded at the centre of China’s coronavirus outbreak, says she wakes up every half-hour during the night. Sometimes she breaks down in tears. \n She and her family are effectively trapped in her grandmother’s apartment building, where a man recently died from the virus. Workers in hazmat suits haunt the surrounding streets, and the neighbourhood has a strong police presence. \n There are shortages of food and other essentials throughout Yichang, the Hubei province city of more than 4 million where they have been in limbo for weeks. \n “No household can go out at this time,” said Ms Chang, a 26-year-old industrial artist. She said she feared that even a trip for groceries would increase her chances of contracting the virus. \n “My child has eaten nine meals of plain noodles in the past three days,” she said of her 2-year-old son. \n Ms Chang and her family thought they were on the verge of escaping Yichang earlier this month, but the bus taking them to the airport was abruptly turned around. \n All she can do now is wait — and hope. \n “The government of Taiwan surely will come to our rescue,” her husband, Mr Calvin Fan, who is from Beijing, has reassured her. But the chartered flight they have eagerly awaited to evacuate them has yet to materialise. \n “Neither side wants us,” Chang said. “We’ve given up. Now we are refugees.” \n Taiwan and China each say the other is the reason that she and other Taiwan citizens are unable to leave Hubei, a province under lockdown, where hundreds have died from the coronavirus and tens of thousands have been infected. \n Ms Chang and hundreds of other Taiwanese people in Hubei had hoped to go home via chartered jet. But last month, after the first plane carrying evacuees landed in Taiwan with an infected passenger onboard, a backlash ensued on the self-governing island, which China claims as part of its territory. \n Some said Taiwan would not be able to handle an outbreak if more infected people arrived. Others said Taiwan should not help to evacuate mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan residents. \n Decades of tensions between the two governments have come to a head over the outbreak, and people like Ms Chang and her husband — both of who arrived in China last month to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday with family — have become pawns in a complicated and dangerous game of political chess. \n Ms Chang said she was told by Chinese officials that she could return to Taiwan on a second chartered flight, scheduled for Feb 5. That day, her family boarded a bus bound for the airport in Wuhan, the provincial capital, where the coronavirus first emerged. \n But just as the bus was about to leave, she said, a Chinese official hopped on and announced that the flight would not take off, saying: “Taiwan won’t let you go back.” \n “I was really devastated,” Ms Chang said. \n Taiwan had a different explanation. According to officials there, reports in Chinese state media that said a flight was scheduled to leave were untrue — the two sides had never discussed it. \n Both governments, and their proxies, have continued to point fingers while Ms Chang and her compatriots languish in Hubei. \n “Taiwan authorities have repeatedly delayed the schedule,” Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, said last week. “Let the Taiwan compatriots return home as soon as possible, and stop making up all manner of excuses and rationale to block them from returning.” \n Mr Chen Shih-Chung, Taiwan’s minister of health and welfare, said Friday that “China still uses all excuses to delay the evacuation, and refuses our plans and suggestions.” \n Fears of the virus — and, perhaps, anti-China sentiment — have led Taiwan to escalate preventive measures in recent days. \n On Wednesday, Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre announced that children who have mainland citizenship but a Taiwanese parent would not be allowed to enter Taiwan for the time being if they were arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. \n Confined to her grandmother’s home for so long, Ms Chang has turned to her art as an outlet for the helplessness and resentment she feels. \n In a satirical cartoon she recently sketched, she portrayed the administration of Ms Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, as deliberately delaying the evacuation. \n She depicted the Taiwanese in Hubei as pawns.

"888888,0,Study of positive coronavirus cases in two of the worst affected countries, China and Italy points to somewhat selective pattern of the spread of Covid-19. That the novel coronavirus targets the older people and avoids the young ones. \nSituation gets complicated leading to deaths if the elderly patient already has some medical issues such as breathing problems, diabetes, heart-related ailments and kidney problems. \nThe mean age of those succumbing to novel coronavirus in Italy was reported to be 81 last week. Italy is known as the country with old population; more than 60 per cent of its total population is over 40. This is said to have contributed to more infections and deaths in Italy than places such as South Korea or even Japan.\nChina too is considered a country of aging peopulation. This refers to share of elderly people (above 60) crossing 10 per cent in the total population. China's elderly (above 60) are more than 17 per cent in its total population. Incidentally in China, the Centre for Disease Control reached a similar conclusion as Italy after examining over 72,000 cases that the disease is deadlier in older people. This is also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn India, all the three deaths due to novel coronavirus infection have happened in the cases of elderly patients. The youngest of them was 64. All had previous medical conditions.\nTwo main reasons have been attributed to this age specific coronavirus spread pattern. First, it is a medical fact that immunity is strongest in childhood and decreases with advancement in age. DNA, the genetic material that guides most functions of human body, is agile in childhood and responds quicker to alien particles entering the body. This boosts immunity. With advancement of age, the DNA messaging gets corrupted and the right message to disease fighting cells are not delivered efficiently.\nSecondly, in most countries, coronavirus testing are symptomatic in process. That is, only those showing synonyms are being tested for novel coronavirus infection. This means a number of children may be passing off without being tested for novel coronavirus. \nWith stronger immunity, children may not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection even if they have contracted the contagion. Untested children means more adults entering the records and hence further skew in the final data.\nThis does not mean that children are completely immune to novel coronavirus infection. At two cases -- one each from China and the UK -- were reported about newborns having tested positive for novel coronavirus. Though, the disease Covid-19 has not been found to be transferring from mother to child during pregnancy. A three-year-old child tested positive for Covid-19 in India. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in India.\nBut the fact that children are largely untested underscores that they can be carriers or vectors of novel coronavirus. Also, medical conditions like asthma and diabetes are not uncommon among children. In many cases obesity-linked diabetes and asthma are related. In such cases, novel coronavirus infection can be fatal for children.\n"

'888888,0,Tass, March 19. In the case of Wuhan, Chinese doctors studied how weather affected the death rate of a new type of Colorado virus (sars-cov-2). Because of the low humidity, the temperature difference between day and night is very big, which causes the death rate of patients to rise. Experts published their conclusions in an article in the medrxiv Electronic Science Library.\n"For the first time, we see the difference between temperature, maximum and minimum, and the effect of humidity on the mortality rate of covid-19, a disease, This is a new type of Colorado virus, first. TASS Our study shows that changes in temperature and humidity have a significant impact on Colorado virus mortality.\nChinese scientists from Lanzhou University and the China Meteorological Administration analyzed data collected by doctors of the Wuhan City outbreak of covid-19. From January 20 to February 29, 2020, that is, when the epidemic peaked and then began to decline.\nDuring this period, nearly 2300 residents died in Wuhan. The doctors compared their daily death toll with the weather in the city at that timeAbout Based on these data, they tried to determine the statistical link between meteorological factors and viral mortality.\nWeather and virus\nScientists\' measurements show that this model does exist, making coronavirus sars-cov-2 similar to its close relatives, 4.

In general, these figures are comparable to the changes in mortality of various respiratory diseases caused by viruses. So it\'s bad habits or high pollution air.\nAs the scientists have emphasized, their access to models does not take into account how HIV transmission and mortality are affected by social factors, including migration and quarantine.

'888888,0,HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - People across the globe are stockpiling facial masks to protect themselves from the new coronavirus, depleting online malls and store shelves from California to Beijing. Yet their efficacy against an outbreak that has claimed more than 130 lives remains uncertain. \n On Amazon and Alibaba, many shops peddling anti-virus masks had run out of stock as of Wednesday (Jan 29). Across China, Hong Kong and Singapore, people lined up for hours at stores and pharmacies hoping to secure dwindling supplies. People from San Francisco to Orlando said they were unable to find surgical masks at their usual outlets. \n While the rush is global, Chinese people living abroad have been buying masks - especially the popular N95 variant made by 3M\xa0- to send back to family members or resell them online, often via Tencent\'s WeChat messaging app. \n Demand is only likely to increase - even though doubts have surfaced among the medical community about their effectiveness in curbing the disease, which some doctors say can spread through physical contact. \n The coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 6,000 - more than the 5,327 cases officially reported in China during the Sars epidemic of 17 years ago. \n "I\'ve been running around town for days to buy masks," said Ms Liu Yan, a 36-year-old\xa0who works in the cryptocurrency industry in Tokyo. She scooped up 2,000 masks to send back to people in China without asking for additional money. \n She said she may stop buying soon because patient numbers were on the rise in Japan and she didn\'t want to deprive locals of supplies. \n While it is still unclear how the 2019-nCoV virus is spreading, one confirmed channel is through direct contact with infected people - most likely coming into contact with respiratory secretions or virus-containing droplets from an infected person\'s cough\n. It\'s also possible the virus could be shed in other ways, including through the fecal waste of acutely infected people. \n Good hand hygiene, including the regular use of an alcohol-based sanitiser, may be more effective than face masks at preventing transmission of the 2019-nCoV virus, said Dr Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Australia\'s Canberra Hospital. \n China\'s government has responded to the worsening shortage by cracking down on vendors who sell fake masks or overcharge online. Over 80 shops on e-commerce platform Taobao, run by Alibaba Group Holding, allegedly sold counterfeit 3M and N95 face masks, Chinese state-media reported on Monday. \n The company said on its official Weibo account that it removed shops found to engage in false advertising or price rigging. The e-commerce site said it sold 80 million face masks through Taobao within two days. \n In Hong Kong, some store chains have begun restricting sales. Watsons said on its official Facebook account it would receive a limited supply on Jan 30, then limit purchases to 50 masks per person on a first come first serve basis. People in the city who have tried to send masks to mainland China said their deliveries got bounced back without being given a clear reason. \n 3M said it is increasing output and working with distributors to ensure sufficient inventory to meet demand and supply existing customers, according to a representative. Other factories are ramping up production. In Japan, plants that supply personal care company Unicharm\xa0have been working around the clock since Jan 17 after orders increased tenfold, according to spokesman Hitoshi Watanabe.\n'
'888888,0,LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L) said on Friday that coronavirus would hit its earnings this year but it wasn’t sure by how much, becoming the latest airline to warn about the impact of the rapidly evolving outbreak.\nCoronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel plunging in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world. Airlines are flying blind into a crisis of unknown severity and duration.\nIAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year but said the uncertainty of the impact and duration of coronavirus meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.\n“It’s a rapidly changing situation,” Chief Executive Willie Walsh told reporters on Friday. “I wouldn’t call it unprecedented. We have seen other challenges for the industry.”\nBritish Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nBritish budget airline easyJet (EZJ.L) also warned on Friday that it had seen “significant” softening of demand for travel to Italy and other European markets and would cancel flights and cut costs. Finland’s Finnair (FIA1S.HE) also warned of a significant fall in profit.\nThe rapid spread of coronavirus has sent shockwaves through the global economy, hammering corporate supply chains, curbing travel, cancelling conferences and sporting events, and wiping tens of billions of pounds off financial markets.\nShare prices were on track for their worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008 and IAG’s is down 25% since the middle of January. On Friday it fell a further 8% to 474 pence.\nThe outbreak in Italy over the last week has brought new disruption to short-haul European travel but Walsh said IAG, with its strong balance sheet, was well-placed to withstand it.\n“I’m very confident that we’ll navigate our way through these challenges,” said Walsh, overseeing his last quarterly results announcement before new boss Luis Gallego takes over on March 26.\nBernstein analyst Daniel Roeska backed Walsh’s thinking: “We are also confident that a downturn would reveal the strength of the IAG model.”\nIAG said it was cutting costs and implementing revenue initiatives, which included looking at all discretionary spending, to help it weather the storm. That’s in line with moves by Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM which have both cut costs in recent days.\nIAG said flight cancellations due to falling demand would hit its 2020 capacity growth though Walsh said it could start adding capacity if other airlines fail and that the group was in a strong position to benefit from any recovery.\nThe company also said its acquisition of Air Europa remained on track for completion later this year and was not affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFor 2019, IAG reported a 5.7% drop in operating profit to 3.285 billion euros, slightly ahead of a downgraded forecast of 3.27 billion euros it gave in September when it said a pilots strike would result in a 215 million euros hit.\n'
'888888,0,The French authorities have registered a third person who has been infected with the new type of corona virus originating in China. According to the Minister of Health, Agn es Buzyn is a close relative of one of the two people who had previously been diagnosed with the new lung disease. All three patients had previously been in China and had been isolated in hospitals. They\'re checking who else they might have been in contact with.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the respiratory tract and can, for example, cause colds\nYeah.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims of death were patients who had some severe pre-existing conditions.\nYeah. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nIn the United States, another person is also infected with the virus, which can lead to severe pneumonia. A woman from Chicago was taken to a hospital according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The woman had reported to her doctor a few days after her return from a Chinese trip with complaints. A case in Seattle had previously been confirmed in the United States.\nThe new virus called 2019-nCoV was first discovered in December 2019 on a closed fish and poultry market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The Coronavirus causes respiratory disease, which can lead to pneumonia. According to previous knowledge, the virus can also be transmitted from human to human.\nFearing a further spread of the virus, this Saturday, millions of Chinese are on their way to China\'s New Year\'s Eve, the Chinese government has ordered national measures for trains, planes and buses. As the national health authority indicated, measuring stations are being set up throughout public transport. Passengers suspected of being infected should be taken "immediately" to a medical facility.\nBefore that, entire cities had been isolated. The cities of Wuhan, Huanggang, Xiantao and Ezhou as well as the smaller Chibi and now also the cities of Xianning, Xiaogan, Enshi and Zhijiang are practically cut off from the outside world. Public transport was suspended\nYeah. Overall, thirteen Chinese cities are now effectively under quarantine, with more than 41 million inhabitants affected. The southern city of Haikou has ordered that all travellers from Hubei will be isolated in a hotel for fourteen days and examined medically.\nIn China, 41 people have died as a result of the disease. According to their own data, the Chinese health authorities have registered infected 1.287 and would investigate several thousand suspected cases. According to calculations by experts from Imperial College London, however, the number of infections is likely to be much higher; they are based on 4.000 infected people.\nOutside China, cases were also confirmed in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. A first case was also reported from Nepal on Friday. All those involved had been to Wuhan before.\nThe president of the Robert Koch Institute relativized the global threat of the new Coronavirus." Outside China so far there are no large chain infections,"Lothar Wieler said in today\'s ZDF Journal on Friday evening. However, the microbiologist stressed that the severity of the disease caused by the virus could not yet be accurately assessed." We do not have complete information,"said Wieler.\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) urged to be prudent." We take this very seriously, we are vigilant, but also with a cool head at the same time,"said the CDU politician in the ARD day topics. You are in daily exchange with experts. I also think it is important that we sort this out in such a way that we can then also take the necessary rest."\nThe Foreign Office invites Chinese travellers to read the Ministry of Health\'s safety instructions carefully before starting their trip. It recommends, among other things, that journeys to the areas affected by the Coronavirus be postponed as far as possible.\n'
"888888,0,Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at what drove Singaporeans across the island to wipe supermarket shelves clean of daily essentials earlier this month, and what it says about the population’s resilience in times of crisis. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here. \n SINGAPORE — While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), the scene that played out on Feb 7 at supermarkets across the island was something no one has witnessed here before — not even during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. \n Hours before, the Ministry of Health (MOH) raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level from Yellow to Orange. \n The risk-alert level was raised after several novel coronavirus cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.\xa0 \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming — and embarrassed — over the behaviour of “ugly Singaporeans”, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?\xa0 \n Customers picking out instant noodles and other non-perishables at Giant Supermarket in Beauty World Centre on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE \n So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China.\xa0 Residents in Thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of Friday, told TODAY that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials. \n Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans’ behaviour.\xa0 \n Speaking to TODAY, Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. \n OTHER TRIGGERS \n Negativity bias \n A spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council said this is a phenomena where our brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones. \n “Our brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,” the spokesperson told TODAY. \n Self-preservation and groupthink \n Whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play. \n “Research suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,” said the spokesperson. “Our ability to decide on our own is minimised.” \n The spokesperson added that people tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation. \n In Singapore’s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. \n Social-media \n Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said the panic-buying is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. \n “(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,” he said. \n Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.\xa0 \n “For the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),” she said. “And that’s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).” \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch, she reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n Empty shelves at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n PUBLIC COMMS ‘COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER’\xa0 \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.\xa0\xa0 \n “The problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,” said Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun.\xa0 \n “Much of the Government’s message involved military terms (and) colour codes,” said Asst Prof Liew, who teaches at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.\xa0 \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n “Some people didn’t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,” said Prof Straughan. “There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.”\xa0 \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.\xa0 \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.\xa0 This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.\xa0 \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.\xa0 \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.\xa0\xa0 \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.\xa0 \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Mr Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications, some of the experts felt that Mr Lee’s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring some sense of normalcy.\xa0\xa0 \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee’s message gave people very concrete actions that “handed back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened”. \n Mr Voedisch\xa0said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n “While authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,” said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an address by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.\xa0 \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with “ready-to-go action plans”. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public’s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.\xa0 \n  \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a recorded message which was televised a day after Singapore raised its Dorscon alert level to Orange.\xa0Photo: MCI \n \u200bHERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been “calm and rational”.\xa0 \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.\xa0\xa0 \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine’s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out “love letters” to frontline healthcare workers. \n QUIET RESILIENCE\xa0 \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.\xa0 \n Scores of Singaporeans — such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries — have seen their livelihoods taken a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.\xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.\xa0 \n “Most nurses are worried too, but it’s our job and this is what we do for a living,” said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.\xa0 \n “But over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.” \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work. \n “It truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,” she said. “But we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.” \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.\xa0\xa0 \n “With the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,” she said. “If they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.” \n Business owners like Ms Chong are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.\xa0 \n Or as NTU’s Asst Prof Liew put it: “We must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.”\xa0 \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \n But he stressed: “We have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living. Life has to go on.” \xa0 \xa0 \n  \xa0 \n \xa0 \n "

Bioeasy does not appear on the same list, according to information left in the embassy\'s official account on the social network Twitter.\nThe embassy further states that the company does not yet have an "official licence from the National Administration of Medical Products of China to sell its products".\nI respect the information published recently by some Spanish measurements on the rapid tests of 35;COVID2019 purchased by 35;Espana to \\35;China, we have informed you of this.\nEmbassy of China in Spain (@ChinEmbaEsp) March 26, 2020\nRapid tests work in a similar way to pregnancy tests: the sample is taken from the area of the nose zone, diluted and deposited in a cartridge with a test strip that marks the lines and indicates whether it is positive, negative or invalid. Tests detect the presence of antigen and the result is obtained in 10 or 15 minutes.\nThe Spanish government has acquired 340.000 examinations and intended to test health workers and elderly people admitted to residences and then extend it to another population. The areas of Galicia, Andalusia and Madrid are running rapid tests, in which a sample is taken from the patient without him getting out of the car.\nThese tests purchased from China served as triage, i.e. when detecting a positive, the patient can already be diagnosed and treated appropriately. If the Chinese test was of sufficient quality, only negative or doubtful results would require a subsequent PCR to confirm, refers to the same publication from the indicated sources.\nIn other words, due to the low sensitivity of the purchased material from Bioeasy, it is not possible to make a large selection and test part of the population, since it is always necessary to do PCR work, i.e. in many cases patients would have to be tested again in laboratoryYeah.\nThe Spanish Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC) has issued a statement to which El Pais had access, informing Spanish health authorities that it is not recommended to use these rapid tests, but to continue with PCR tests.\nThe SEIMC document ensures that a "rapid diagnosis of these cases at hospital level is relevant to identify, isolate and treat patients quickly" and facilitate "emergency decongement". "For this we need rapid tests with high sensitivity", it adds.\nThe Ministry of Health also confirmed to the Spanish publication the poor results of the sensitivity and specificity analyses.

'888888,0,SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - American passengers were taken off a cruise liner on Sunday to fly home after being quarantined for two weeks off Japan, while China said the rate of new coronavirus cases had slowed, calling that proof its steps to fight the outbreak were working.\nAn announcement aboard the Diamond Princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since Feb. 3, told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship.\nOf the roughly 400 Americans on the cruise, more than 40 are infected with the virus and will stay in Japan for treatment, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n“They are not going to go anywhere. They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan,” Fauci told the CBS News program “Face the Nation.” “People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the United States.”\nKyodo News Agency said the flights carrying U.S. passengers left Haneda Airport at around 1700 ET (2200 GMT).\nCanadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers.\n“Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,” U.S. passenger Gay Courter told Reuters.\nSeventy new coronavirus cases were confirmed on board, bringing the total on the ship to 355, by far the largest cluster of cases outside China. Fauci told the Washington Post there were 44 infected Americans.\nWithin China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit.\n“The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the Health Commission, told reporters.\nThe new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who traveled from Chinese cities, with five deaths.\nThe coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in China’s central province of Hubei. China’s response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown.\nMi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical.\nMark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Britain’s University of Edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in Hubei, “then this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too”.\nBut he added: “We should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure.”\nDeclining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in Wuhan, he said.\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted.\nOn board the Diamond Princess, American passenger Matthew Smith posted a photo on Twitter showing buses parked on the shore to take U.S. nationals to the airport. American officials in hazmat suits and masks had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay.\nThe ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in the port of Yokohama and those with the disease have been taken to hospital onshore. No one from the ship has died.\nCountries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free, and quarantine them on arrival.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense is preparing to receive two flights with passengers - one to land at Travis Air Force Base, California and the other at Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.\nThe evacuees will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.\nAnother cruise ship, Holland America’s MS Westerdam, docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports elsewhere. An 83-year-old American passenger tested positive upon arriving in Malaysia, authorities there said. A second test requested by the cruise operator confirmed the finding.\nTaiwan reported its first fatality on Sunday. The first fatality in Europe was reported on Saturday, an 80-year-old Chinese man who died at a Paris hospital.\n'
'888888,0,According to the introduction: radcivir is a new experimental broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed by Gilead science company of the United States, which is believed to effectively inhibit the replication of SARS virus and mers virus in respiratory epithelial cells. Although the drug is still in phase III clinical trials against the Ebola virus, the latest news shows that the drug takes effect immediately after being used in a patient infected with "Wuhan pneumonia" in the United States. The news came out that the Wuhan virus Institute immediately applied for patent for Reed\'s new version of the 2019 coronavirus. In addition, 270 samples of the drug were sent to Beijing China Japan Friendship Hospital for clinical trial of "Wuhan pneumonia" patients.\nOn Tuesday, the official website of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that they had applied for a Chinese invention patent for the U.S. new drug readcivir, which had not been officially used yet, as early as January 21, while the day before January 21, the Chinese official just officially announced that Wuhan pneumonia is a serious human to human infectious disease. That is to say, the research on the efficacy of ridacivir by Wuhan Virus Research Institute has been carried out long before that. When Wu Han was ignorant and ignorant that he was at risk of infection, Wuhan\'s top Chinese Academy of Sciences Virus Research Institute had discovered an effective drug against new official coronavirus without official name.\nSure enough, Wuhan Virus Research Institute is not only mysterious, but also really awesome. Maybe it is really ahead of the virus. But this is where people\'s fear is now, and it also deepens the worries about the source of various viruses. Many people know that Wuhan Virus Research Institute is the highest level Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but they do not understand why in the process of the spread of Wuhan pneumonia virus, this institution is extremely low-key. Wuhan\'s mountains and rivers support this institution for virus research, but Wuhan people have become the biggest victims of the virus. After the outbreak was announced, many factors promoted the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, which was hidden in the boudoir, to the public, but it was still covered with mystery.\nAs for the rush to register and use patents, Wuhan Virus Research Institute may be motivated to show that it wants to contribute to the country, but it is puzzling because of the use of the term "invention patent". According to Free Asia report, the news ignited public opinion, and netizens left messages to discuss\n。 Some netizens said, "do you know who has seized the treatment patent of" ridacivir "in China? Wuhan Virus Research Institute, together with military units, on January 21, rushed to "use ridacivir to treat 2019 new coronavirus patent", and spread the rights and interests to the world through international agreements. What kind of operation is this? "\nSome netizens also pointed out that "free drugs from the United States have been patented by Wuhan Virus Research Institute!"! American free open molecular structure, to China\'s treatment of pneumonia medicine radcivir by the virus by the brand, Americans completely ignorant of it! Let\'s see how the snake killed the farmer! "\nNetizens criticized and said, "it\'s shameless! Take what others give painstakingly and selflessly, change it a little, and then become your own thing, and register for patent to make a lot of money. " "This is the most shameless thing in the world! We don\'t try our best to do real work for the anti epidemic situation. We really spend a lot of time on opportunism, striving for fame and wealth for ourselves, and stealing other people\'s achievements! It\'s disgusting! " "People all over the world know the fact that the Communist Party is not afraid that the whole world will be besieged and beaten when it plays with hooligans like this?"\nRen Zhao, a Zhengzhou lawmaker, sent an open letter to Wuhan Virus Research Institute on Wednesday, urging it to disclose details of the virus research process. He said that many people had reported the management confusion of Wuhan Virus Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences under their real names, and then deleted the post. The licensing application includes the details of virus preservation and access to the Institute from 2019 to 2020, the details of research and development of coronavirus in the Institute, the detailed documents of research and development process and patent application of radcivir, and the research direction, published papers and detailed resumes of Professor Shi Zhengli in the Institute.\nAbout the source of the new crown pneumonia virus in Wuhan, Chinese officials have cited the source of the virus to the Southern China seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. But Indian researchers recently published a paper saying that four inserts of the new coronavirus were similar to HIV, and they suspected that the outbreak in China was related to the leakage of samples from Wuhan virus Institute.\nOn February 4, Xu Bo, chairman of the mainland\'s Duoyi network, tweeted that his real name had reliable evidence as a clue to report to Wuhan Virus Research Institute. Xu Bo cited some basic facts, and attached several evidence links such as "paper published by Shi Zhengli of Wuhan Virus Research Institute".\nXu Bo said that because the epidemic prevention is of great importance, it is suspected that Wuhan Virus Research Institute has mismanaged the experimental animals, causing the outflow of experimental animals, leading to the 2019 new coronavirus epidemic\n。 He also stressed, "I clearly believe that the genetically modified virus developed by Shi Zhengli in 2015 is different from the new coronavirus in Wuhan, but there must be a large number of other similar viruses in his laboratory, and then there must be further research on similar viruses, which is the truth that should be investigated."\nThe White House\'s chief strategist, ban Nong, said on Monday (February 3rd) that the Chinese Communist Party lied about everything. If the new coronavirus was found to be artificially synthesized, the Communist Party of China would be finished.\n'
'888888,0,SINGAPORE — Four new cases of Covid-19 have been found in Singapore, three of which are linked to the cluster at Wizlearn Technologies, an e-learning solutions provider located at 10 Science Park Road, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Sunday (March 1). \n This cluster, which was first announced on Friday, now has 11 cases. \n Two more patients (Cases 54 and 60) have been discharged, bringing the total who have fully recovered and discharged to 74, MOH said. \n Of the 32 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving.

'888888,0,This Thursday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) opted not to declare an international emergency in the face of the coronavirus outbreak in the city of Wuhan in central China, which has already caused 17 deaths and more than 600 diagnosed infections.\nAfter two days of meetings at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, an emergency committee consisting of medical experts from several countries and convened by the Director-General of the Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has for the time being dismissed the possible international alert, fearing that it will "be too soon".\nThe WHO reserves the possibility of bringing the committee together in the future to discuss a possible international emergency again, which would involve the implementation of preventive measures at global level.\nThat international body defines a global emergency as an\'extraordinary event\'which poses a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.\nPrevious global emergencies have been reported for the appearance of the Zika virus in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic and polio.\nA global emergency statement usually brings more money and resources, but it can also lead foreign governments to rush to restrict travel and trade to affected countries.\nAccording to information made available today by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) and disseminated by the Portuguese Directorate-General for Health, since the 31-December of 2019, 614 laboratory cases confirmed for infection with the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), including 15 health professionals and 17 fatalities.\nIn China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) 603 cases were diagnosed, followed by Thailand (04 cases), Macao (02), Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Post and the United States of America (all with one case).\nThe new virus causing viral pneumonias was detected in China at the end of 2019\nYeah.\nThis is a new type of coronavirus, which is transmitted between animals and passed on to humans, and there are already records of individual transmission to human beings, but still in totally substantiated circumstances.\nThe first cases of the 2019-nCoV virus appeared in mid-December in the Chinese town of Whuan, when people with a viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals. It was found that all people were often working or visiting Huanan\'s seafood and meat market in the same city. The exact origin of the infection is still unknown, but it would have been infected animals, which are marketed alive, transmitting it to humans.\nSymptoms of these coronaviruses ar e more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress, including shortness of breath.\n'
'888888,0,LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L) said on Friday that coronavirus would hit its earnings this year but it wasn’t sure by how much, becoming the latest airline to warn about the impact of the rapidly evolving outbreak.\nCoronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel plunging in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world. Airlines are flying blind into a crisis of unknown severity and duration.\nIAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year but said the uncertainty of the impact and duration of coronavirus meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.\n“It’s a rapidly changing situation,” Chief Executive Willie Walsh told reporters on Friday. “I wouldn’t call it unprecedented. We have seen other challenges for the industry.”\nBritish Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nBritish budget airline easyJet (EZJ.L) also warned on Friday that it had seen “significant” softening of demand for travel to Italy and other European markets and would cancel flights and cut costs. Finland’s Finnair (FIA1S.HE) also warned of a significant fall in profit.\nThe rapid spread of coronavirus has sent shockwaves through the global economy, hammering corporate supply chains, curbing travel, cancelling conferences and sporting events, and wiping tens of billions of pounds off financial markets.\nShare prices were on track for their worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008 and IAG’s is down 25% since the middle of January. On Friday it fell a further 8% to 474 pence.\nThe outbreak in Italy over the last week has brought new disruption to short-haul European travel but Walsh said IAG, with its strong balance sheet, was well-placed to withstand it.\n“I’m very confident that we’ll navigate our way through these challenges,” said Walsh, overseeing his last quarterly results announcement before new boss Luis Gallego takes over on March 26.\nBernstein analyst Daniel Roeska backed Walsh’s thinking: “We are also confident that a downturn would reveal the strength of the IAG model.”\nIAG said it was cutting costs and implementing revenue initiatives, which included looking at all discretionary spending, to help it weather the storm. That’s in line with moves by Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM which have both cut costs in recent days.\nIAG said flight cancellations due to falling demand would hit its 2020 capacity growth though Walsh said it could start adding capacity if other airlines fail and that the group was in a strong position to benefit from any recovery.\nThe company also said its acquisition of Air Europa remained on track for completion later this year and was not affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFor 2019, IAG reported a 5.7% drop in operating profit to 3.285 billion euros, slightly ahead of a downgraded forecast of 3.27 billion euros it gave in September when it said a pilots strike would result in a 215 million euros hit.\n'

'888888,0,We\'re all in shock. It\'s no less the case. Nobody, especially in the Western world, has experienced such a situation. I have written here many times that we live in a global world. Now, in this global village that allows us to be rapidly connected with Australia or Canada, which allows us to do business with any point on the globe, it also returns us as this virus whose spread began in China. Yes, this is also globalisation.\nWe are facing an unprecedented crisis, because the latest epidemics have remained more geographically concentrated. The crisis in 2008, for example, was not closely or by far similar to this one. It was mainly financial and economic. We have had social consequences, but without the public health problems that we are witnessing and that we will have ahead of us.\nIt is no accident that at Christmas the most common message is the desire for health, because that good, that gift, is undoubtedly the greatest we can have. Even to deal with the financial and economic crises. We are at a stage where circumstances and risks almost lead us to say: screw the economy, screw the orthodoxy of certain decision-makers. Oh, what the hell. I don\'t think there is any business that is greater than the value of human life. We just can\'t mess with the economy. We have to take care of everyone today to then restore the economy.\nLet\'s be clear. Nobody can cope with a pandemic like this on their own. There are no resources. There\'s no way. Portugal is no exception. Portugal already had many problems in our National Health Service (SNS) before Covid-19. We are not prepared, or less so to test the SNS response peak, the fans, the machines, do not multiply, much less the health professionals, whose shoulders will carry weights that will test their limits, such as China and Italy have already shown uYeah.\nHowever, not being prepared cannot mean standing idly by and waiting for danger. No, we can\'t. For exceptional periods, responses must be exceptional. Yeah, we need to be home. Yes, we need to realize that this is no joking matter, to go to the beach or simply ignore the gravity of the contagion facility problem. In the life of society, the unconsciousness of some can, in a literal sense, endanger the lives of others, especially those of the most vulnerable.\nThat\'s why we need strong leadership and authority. We can\'t play governors. It\'s not enough to play statesman. We need people with fiber and a pulse to make tough, unpopular, but necessary decisions. We don\'t need politics. We cannot be held hostage by seemingly technical opinions, because in these public health measures the technician becomes inseparable from the politician. Italy is a dramatic example. It\'s over there. To observe, learn and correct answers.\nAnd this is also a defining moment. Where is the European Union? What\'s your answer? Years and years of building Europe, of bureaucratic institutions and when we have a global problem, it is every man for himself. This is what it feels like, very little cooperation and solidarity. And this will have economic and political consequences up ahead. But up ahead, we all want to be alive. Living also to evaluate the answers that our political decision-makers have given us, that time will come to take stock, to make the assessments, but after the fire has turned to ashes. Living to rebuild a world that\'s all connected and that shows us that there\'s no one immune in a situation like this. Rich and poor, West and East. We are all in the same boat, humanity, just like the planet where we live, is one.\nI think there is no greater fear than death or watching our own perish. And that should be our focus. Then, with health care, with all patients treated, we must rebuild a global economyYeah. We still can\'t account for the two-week damage at home, especially when we don\'t even know if it\'s only gonna be 15 days or more. It will be dramatic for commerce, catering, hospitality and other services. Yes,ma\'am. I\'m afraid so. The tourism sector is devastated by the cancellations. Many factories will have to stop or work well below their capacity. But we urgently need to clamp this thing down so we can get back to the terraces, the restaurants, the shopping centres and the beaches. Without a vaccine, without effective anti-virus suppression of COVID-19 we are left with, as epidemiologist Peter Piot (one of the researchers who discovered Ebola) called them, "medieval methods of containment: isolation, quarantine and contact mapping".\nFuck the economy, people\'s safety comes first. It takes courage'

'888888,0,This week, the Macao authorities issued two industrial licenses to two pharmaceutical plants for the production of disinfection products, which disappeared from the market with the outbreak of the new Chinese coronavirus.\nOne of the plants has already started producing disinfectant alcohol and hand sanitizer, prevention products that cannot be found on the shelves of pharmacies and supermarkets more than two weeks ago.\nContrary to the distribution of masks, the Macao Government first stated that it could not ensure the supply of disinfectant products to the general public, as it had to give priority to healthcare professionals.\nToday, in a statement, the authorities also informed that the Nam Kwong Trade and Industrial Union, a Chinese capital company based in Macao, donated 3.4 tons of disinfectant alcohol to "support the work to prevent and combat the epidemic in the territory".\nA donation that is added to the seven tons already collected recently by the Macao government.\nOne of the first measures taken by the Macao government, in addition to sending thousands of civil servants home, where they continue to work, but from a distance, went through the rationing of masks, having acquired twenty million in countries such as Portugal and the United States.\nThe purchase must be made in about fifty agreed pharmacies, with the population having to produce an identification document, entitled to 10 masks, and can be bought again ten days later.\nMacau also closed casinos and announced the closure of cultural and sporting spaces, parks, gardens and leisure spaces, as well as all kinds of businesses, which is practically paralysing the economy.\nYeah.\nAuthorities also informed this Sunday at a press conference that 15 hotels and pensions closed one day after the closure of seven hotels: Hotel Legend Palace, Rocks Hotel, Sofitel Hotel, The Four Seasons Hotel, Grand Harbour Hotel, St. Regis Macao and Conrad Macao.\nChina raised today to 811 dead and more than 37 thousand infected the balance of the pneumonia outbreak caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (center), placed under quarantine.\nIn the previous 24-hour period, there have been 89 deaths and 2.656 new cases.\nThe new balance is already beyond the Acute Grave Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 has caused the death of 774 people around the world, most of whom in China, but the mortality rate remains lower.\nSo far, the only two deaths caused by the new coronavirus registered outside mainland China have occurred in the Philippines and Hong Kong.\nIn addition to the mainland of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more than 300 cases of contagion confirmed in 25 countries. In Europe, the number arrived on Saturday to 37, with new infections detected in France.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO), which declared an international public health emergency in mid-January, indicated on Saturday that cases of contagion reported daily in China are stabilising, but stressed that it was early to conclude that the epidemic had reached its peak.\n'
'888888,0,The first confirmed case in Spain coronavirus Wuhan, a German tourist, is "perfectly" and no symptoms of the disease. He and five other German citizens who were negative in tests remain in quarantine at the Our Lady Hospital Guadalupe Island of La Gomera for possible contain contagions, as reported Saturday morning Fernando Simon, director of the Coordinating Center Health emergencies.\nSimon has given some details of the case following a ministerial meeting evaluation and monitoring of the coronavirus, which was held at the Ministry of Health. Right now there is no other case study. The patient contracted the disease confirmed in Germany, after a "very direct" contact with an employee which had transmitted a female colleague who came from China. At the time of infection, this had some symptoms (although still had not tested positive), so the hypothesis that the disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients is increasingly losing weight, according to Simon.\nGerman tourists who are now in quarantine arrived in Spain on 28 night from Munich. At the next day, to notify the German authorities the positive in the case of the employee and have the record that those who had traveled to Spain had maintained contact with him, it was decided, in principle, a home insulation in the municipality of Hermigua. After doing tests, five of them were negative, but remain quarantined and under observation. The other was positive, so their situation is confinement in a hospital room, although on no symptoms, does not require any special care. This is a precautionary measure.\nHealth authorities are now looking for contacts to track if they appear symptoms of the disease. Two people who will track them be who traveled to her on the plane. Canary President Victor Angel Torres, reported Saturday that tourists came to Tenerife and, hence, went to La Gomera by boat, reports Pedro Murillo. The victim made the trip, an hour, to the side of a window, which "minimizes the risks." "There is an accurate description since he left Germany" has assured the head of the Epidemiology service Canaries Domingo Nunez. "On the boat he did not move even to go to the bathroom;. There was no contact with other passengers There is no reason to think about contact risk." The port of San Sebastian de La Gomera were moved by rental car to Hermigua, one small town located 20 kilometers from the capital where many houses are located.\nHealth Minister, Salvador Illa, expressed his confidence in the NHS. "The detection and warning systems are working. We have already warned that it was possible that some cases were detected in Spain", he has assured after the meeting between the government responsible. Illa has announced that it will convene all health counselors of the autonomous communities in an extraordinary inter-territorial council early next week to study the situation and, if necessary, strengthen the prevention and detection of the virus week.\nMeanwhile, the Spanish quarantined arrived on Friday to the Gómez Ulla hospital in Madrid also in perfect condition, the ministry reported. The center is coordinating how will the regime of family visits. The twenty nationals who are on the 17th floor of the military hospital grounds do not require evidence first, since they are not "risk cases" in the words of Simon, "simply they remain in quarantine" that China had already imposed in Wuhan.\nWuhan coronavirus has already left 304 dead and affected more than 14,000 worldwide. Of these, 151 are in 23 countries other than China. The rapid ascent of the number of cases-just over a month has exceeded the number of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, for its acronym in English), history more similar- and the first contagions outside China-and there have been not imported into Germany, the UK, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the international health emergency on Thursday. This measure allows the body to coordinate actions and make recommendations to countries, but so far have not substantially changed compared to before the global alarm. It has been ruled advising countries to restrict trade or travel to China.'
"888888,0,The red bubbles that denounce the spread and extent of the epidemic of the Johns Hopkins Center interactive map are gaining ground. The cases confirmed by the new coronavirus, originating in Wuhan in central China, are approaching round 100 thousand. More than half of the affected have healed (3200 deaths).\nAfter the Chinese Government's failure to act successfully on the outbreak, after decoding what the virus is and how it navigates, the traditional recommendations to successfully act in community, quarantines, economic coups, alarms and excesses that in some cities have led to the race for supermarkets, fear, the scenarios, forecasts, reflections and comparisons, the mechanisms activated to treat the infected and any infected, the problem remains: to contain the spread.\nInformation updated at 13am on Thursday, 5th in March\nJohns Hopkins Center.\nThe first stage of this story was to put a stop to the spread of Covid-19, which has packed its bags and is travelling around the world, hence the status of a pandemic. Only in China there are over 80 thousand confirmed cases, while in South Korea they rose to more than 6000. Around here, in Europe, Italy leads the ranking that nobody wants to lead, with more than 3000 infected. Iran is in the fourth world place, despite some advances and setbacks in communication transparency, with almost 3000 patients.\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus forced governments to take action, some of them by erecting invisible walls and tightening borders and access. In other words, there is a vast travel restriction; the doors have closed for certain passengers. This Bloomberg article, based on data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), helps to understand the real size of this new world.\nLet us start with the Italian case in close proximity to Portugal.Yeah. The country has now refused flights from China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Russia has shut the door on Chinese and passport holders from Hong Kong and Macao.\nThe United States denies entry to foreigners who had travelled to China in the two weeks prior to arrival. Americans who have been in that Asian country are automatically quarantined for 14 days.\nJapan rejects passengers who have been in places in China such as Hubei, Daegu, Cheongdo and Zhejiang in the previous 14 days. Australia and New Zealand are more or less on the same page, banning travellers from China and Iran. In the case of Australians, restrictions are extended to passengers who have been on the Diamond Princess cruise, which is based in Yokohama, Japan.\nIran, for example, does not receive any Chinese citizens and passengers with Covid-19 symptoms. This measure prohibits the blind entry of Chinese passengers extends to other countries such as Paraguay, Guatemala, Trinidad Tobago, Belize, the Cayman Islands, Somalia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.\nOman goes further and extends this list to passengers from China, Italy and Iran. Turkey, which currently feeds a diplomatic war with the European Union and Greece using migrants and refugees, has banned visitors arriving (or having been in the previous 14 days) from countries such as China, Iran, Iraq, Italy and Korea. South.\nVietnam, in addition to having cancelled air links with China, denies entry into the country to which it passed in the previous 14-day travelers who have crossed the territories of South Korea, Iran and Italy are quarantined for 14 days. Indonesia does not receive anyone who has been to China in the previous two weeks.\nKazakhstan, for example, bordering China, has only swept the map of Iranian citizens arriving.Yeah.\nAngola, by the way, is the one that tightens the grip on the rules (and, hopefully, the virus) on the African continent, making it impossible for passengers to land (or have passed) from Algeria, China, Egypt, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Nigeria to arrive.\nThe data published by Bloomberg and IATA, which are not fully mentioned in this text, are updated by March 5th this Thursday."
'888888,0,China is delaying grant of clearance to India\'s proposal to send an Indian Air Force flight to carry relief material for people affected by coronavirus in the neighbouring country and bring back Indians from its city of Wuhan, official sources said Saturday.\nIndia was to send a C-17 military transport aircraft to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, on February 20 but the plane could not take off as permission was not granted for the flight.\n"China is deliberately delaying grant of clearance for the evacuation flight," a high-level source said.\nThe aircraft was to carry a large consignment of medical supplies to China and bring back more Indians from Wuhan.\nSources said the Chinese side continued to maintain that there was no delay in granting permission for the flight to go, but "inexplicably" the clearance has not been given.\nIn a letter to President Xi Jinping earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed India\'s solidarity to the people and government of China in meeting the challenge of the coronavirus outbreak and offered to provide assistance to the country.\nIndia then put together relief supplies in pursuance of Modi\'s commitment as a token of India\'s solidarity, particularly in the 70th year of the anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n"These supplies have been offered even as India faces tremendous shortage itself, given our ethos of helping others in their hour of need," said a source aware of the issue.\nThe items being supplied are gloves, surgical masks, feeding pumps and defibrillators based on the requirements as indicated by the Chinese side.\nIndia\'s national carrier Air India has already evacuated around 640 Indians from Wuhan in two separate flights.\nAccording to estimates, over 100 Indians are still living in Wuhan. A sizeable number of countries have evacuated their citizens from China and restricted movement of people and goods to and from the country in view of the massive outbreak of coronavirus there.\nIndian nationals in Wuhan continue their long wait for the flight. The delay is causing them and their family members in India tremendous mental anguish, said the sources.\nThey said relief and evacuation flights from other countries including by France are allowed to operate by China but the permission has not come through in India\'s case.\n"Are they not interested in Indian aid provided as our token of support? Why are they creating roadblock in evacuating our nationals from Wuhan and putting them under hardship and mental agony?" said a person aware of the issue.\n'
'888888,0,Moscow, 26 Russian news agency. Chinese scientists have found that the Malay pangolin virus smuggled into Chinese territory is very similar to sars-cov-2, which is responsible for the covid-19 epidemic. The results have been published in the journal Nature.\nCurrent data show that the main source of coronate-cov-2 is bats. But in order for the virus to spread from bats to humans, intermediate animals are needed. In the past, because of SARS CoV and mers CoV, Palmetto branch and troostite were intermediates respectively. Their coronavirus infection rate was 99.8%.\nThe transition species of animals, in which sars-cov-2 virus mutates into human "choice", have not been found. Because of the outbreak of new coronavirus infection, the seafood market in Wuhan has been destroyed, so it is difficult to find the animal - coronavirus carrier.\nAs candidates, scientists think the same civet and snake, but despite their discovery of a similar coronavirus, intimacy with humans is not enough. Another possible alternative is pangolin, which has the same coronavirus as bats. These rare animals are illegally transported from Malaysia to ChinAbout Their meat is considered delicious, while scaly shells are used in traditional medicine.\nChinese scientists, with the assistance of their Australian counterparts, analyzed frozen samples of pangolin tissue and blood seized in anti smuggling operations, The Chinese government has implemented a series of projects in southern China in 2017-2019. 31 animal samples were studied. Nine of them carried coronavirus.\nThe results of metagenomic sequencing showed that there were strong similarities between the lines of these coronaviruses and sars-cov-2, 85-92%, and even similarities in the genomic field were found in one sequencing, This is a encoded S-B protein that forms the spines of the virus, making it look like a crown, responsible for the virus entering the host cell. However, none of these viruses had specific sequence changes in human sars-cov-2, This did not add a clear role for pangolinov in transferring the coroner to the person.\nThe author points out that it is precisely pangolins that are the intermediate hosts directly involved in the current outbreak of covid-19 Their human viruses must be at least 95 percent, noAbout\nBut the fact that pangolina is a potentially lethal coronal vehicle, scientists believe, requires immediate action, The sale of meat and crustacean parts of these animals on the market is strictly prohibited.\nScientists also believe that long-term monitoring of chimpanzees in wild animals is necessary to understand their role in producing royal animals, A potential infector'

'888888,0,BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, sending markets into a tailspin over fears of a global pandemic even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities.\nWhile health experts have expected limited outbreaks beyond China, the rapid acceleration of cases in Italy going from three on Friday to 220 on Monday is concerning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.\nJust as China put cities on lockdown, Italian authorities sealed off the worst-affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases.\nShops are shut, bars are closed and people speak to each other from a safe distance in northern Italy.\nMarkets are nervous that Europe could experience disruptions similar to China, where air traffic has been disrupted and global supply chains rattled for everything from medicine to cars to smartphones.\nBut China’s actions, especially in Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward, urging the rest of the world to learn the lesson of acting fast.\n“They’re at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in,” he said.\nThe surge of cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets as investors fled to safe havens. European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018. All three indexes closed down more than 3% after notching record highs last week on optimism the coronavirus would not seriously hurt global economies.\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index , jumped to a one-year high.\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word “pandemic” did yet not fit the facts.\n“We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,” he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.\nThe epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the WHO said.\nDr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies program, told reporters it was still possible to contain the virus and that it might appear each year like the flu.\n“The virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic,” he said in Geneva on Monday. “And at this point, it is not possible to say which of those realities is going to happen.”\nIn the United States, the White House is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading virus, a White House spokesman and an administration source said on Monday. Politico and the Washington Post had reported the Trump administration may request $1 billion.\nLiang Wannian of China’s National Health Commission said while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue.\nExcluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20.\nOverall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier. That took the total number of cases to 77,150, while the death toll rose by 150 to 2,592.\nThere was a measure of relief for the world’s second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections.\nOutside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to some 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.\nSouth Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833.

'888888,0,None of them is the worst possible forecast, today stressed Laurence Boone, Chief Economist of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), but vary between "best" if the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (at the origin of Covid-19 disease) is essentially contained in China and the known focuses, or more serious, if extended more globally.\nIn the best-case scenario scenario, completed at the beginning of last week, Laurence Boone explained this morning at a press conference, global economic growth takes a 0,5% (or 200 billion dollars) cut to 2,4% (face to 2,9% at 2019, which was the same scheduled growth for organisation last November, for 2020). In this predictive framework, the growth will be of 3,3% at 2021 (just above the expected 3,1% in November) said the OECD Chief Economist, estimating the organisation that, in this view, all impacts start to fade gradually at the beginning of next year.\nA scenario that cuts world economic growth in 0.5% implies a drop in 4% of domestic demand in China and Hong Kong in the first quarter of this year, to which more 2% in the second quarter join. Overall, a drop in 10% in markets and non-food raw materials in the first half of 2020 explains the OECD.\nAt this reading, the growth of the euro area will be 0,8% while remaining 1,2% at 2021, downloading from the previous OECD forecast, 1,1%. OECD forecasts are getting worse for France (growing 0,9% in 2020, in the face of 1,3% in 2019 and in the light of the 1,2% expected in November for this year) and Italy (stagnation at 0% in the face of 0,2% growth in 2019 and a cut in relation to the 0,4% that the OECD had foreseen four months ago). For Germany, the forecast is 0,3% in 2020, in relation to 0,6% in 2019. In November 2019, the OECD estimated that the German economy would grow 0.4% this yeaYeah.\nIn China, the expected growth for 2020 is 4,9%, when in 2019 it was 6,1%. Here, the forecast cut between November and today is 0,8 percentage points.\nIn the worst-case scenario of domin o effect, where "this is not the worst-case scenario" Laurence Boone said this morning that he circumvented all direct questions about the possibility of a potential short-term recession, global or country-wide, the impact on world GDP will be 1.5%. In other words, the OECD\'s chief economist recalled "almost half of the expected [global] economic growth [by the OECD] four months ago". At that time, as already mentioned, the forecast was that in 2020 the overall growth would be 2,9%.\nIn this scenario, in addition to the forecast reduction of Chinese domestic demand in the same order as the "most optimistic" scenario, an extension is added to other regions: a decrease in "more than 2% in demand in most Asia-Pacific countries" and in the more developed economies in the Northern Hemisphere during the second quarter of this year, with a decrease in 20% in the capital market and in the price of non-food raw materials, plus "an increase in demand for 50-point basis for the risk premium for investment in all countries\'.\nThe OECD is particularly concerned about the\'trust shock\'in world markets, reflected last week in the main, if not all, squares of Asia, Europe and the USA.\nAnd this, Laurence Boone argued this Monday, "is not a shock that can be faced only by the central banks." The chief economist of the organisation said that we must deal with and increase confidence in the capital market. "This is not a crisis that can be fought by the central banks, but by the budgetary authorities."\nGovernments "must act now to restrict the advancement of the new coronavirus, to protect populations and businesses from its effects and to support economic demand", says the organizatioYeah.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\n"There is much that governments can do for people," Laurence Boone said, while presenting power point to journalists by video conference. And after the page entitled "Governments must act now", he listed the possible measures. For the general population:\'increase resources for the health sector\',\'temporarily finance for more vulnerable families\',\'expand temporary work models\'.\nIn the case of companies, OECD suggestions for global governments to deal with the new coronavirus involve "reducing or postponing tax recoveries for the most affected sectors"; "increasing liquidity and availability of credit to businesses", and "reducing state debt to the business sector".\nIn macroeconomic terms, the OECD also leaves a mini-script:\'increase liquidity to banking\', ensure that monetary policy has an adequate response\'to extreme market conditions\',\'allow automatic stabilisers to function fully\'and\'increase public investment\''

'888888,1,1/GIVE NO QUARTER  \n Few will regret the end of the first 2020 quarter. Fears of a U.S.-Iran war gave way to the coronavirus pandemic which JPMorgan reckons will have pushed the world economy into a 12% contraction over January to March. The quarter saw the most brutal global equity collapse since the Great Depression, exacerbated by a 60% oil price slump.  \n April may not bring much relief, with coronavirus still spreading rapidly and keeping large parts of the global economy shuttered. Banks have rushed to slash Q2 forecasts too, so expect more turbulence on financial markets.  \n The cavalry has arrived though. G20 governments have promised a $5 trillion revival effort, major central banks have slashed rates and restarted asset purchases. Markets have bounced big and may actually end Q1 on a high. What we need now is to see infection rates peaking and that will show whether April falls, or if it\'s indeed time for spring.  \n  \n (Graphic: World stocks vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4023/3979/msci.png)  \n  \n 2/PANDEMIC PAYROLLS:  \n Through years of stubbornly low economic growth and inflation, the brightest spot was the U.S. labour market, with unemployment reaching half-century lows. Coronavirus may have ended that boom.  \n With infections surging, cities in lockdown, businesses downing shutters and most travel on ice, staff layoffs are likely to mushroom. That showed up in the number of Americans filing unemployment benefit claims which hit a record of more than 3 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though some estimates were as high as 4 million.  \n Now the wait is on for Friday\'s non-farm payrolls figures that will offer a snapshot of the jobs picture over March. The government\'s unprecedented $2 trillion fiscal expansion package includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount to fund direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to U.S. families.  \n Economists expect the payroll data to show a loss of 293,000 jobs - the largest monthly drop since July 2009. A significant overshoot of that and the $2 trillion stimulus approved by Congress could suddenly start to look inadequate.  \n  \n (Graphic: Pandemic payrolls, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3945/3901/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 3/CHINA\'S PYRRHIC VICTORY  \n The world\'s factory is re-opening, but the market is closed and the shoppers are gone.  \n China\'s social isolation policies appear to have contained the coronavirus at home, allowing work and travel to resume. But major economic damage may be yet to come. With infections climbing exponentially in the United States, Europe and the other markets China exports to, and with supply chains in disarray, China is getting neither the imported components it needs nor demand for its products.  \n Already Chinese factories\' Jan-Feb profits have hit their lowest in a decade and upcoming manufacturing surveys will very likely reveal more pain. And just like everywhere else, job losses are mounting up, regardless of how many cheap loans are being offered to businesses. Expectations are now for the economy to contract this quarter but many economists reckon 2020 growth will be around 2% - a third of the "around 6%" authorities target.  \n  \n (Graphic: China\'s Industrial profits shrinking, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9258/9170/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 4/COME TOGETHER, RIGHT NOW  \n The European Central Bank has done its bit to tackle the virus damage, having massively expanded asset purchases, agreed to more flexibility on the share of bonds it buys from each country and buffered borrowing costs for weaker euro zone states such as Italy. Now it\'s up to European Union leaders to come together.  \n So far there is no united front: they\'ve failed to agree on the scale of support for\xa0economies ravaged by the outbreak. The ECB\'s aggressive action gives them some breathing space but, as of now, politicians are wrangling over setting up a credit line worth some 2% of annual output from the euro area bailout fund.  \n Many European governments urge the issuance of a joint debt instrument to face a crisis which Goldman Sachs economists estimate may shrink the euro economy by 9% this year. But Germany and some others oppose that. At stake, says France\'s Emmanuel Macron, is the survival of the European project. The crisis, for sure, is far from over.  \n  \n (Graphic: 10-year bond yield spreads over Germany, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4030/3986/DE2703.png)  \n  \n 5/FRONTIERS ON THE EDGE  \n It\'s been a tough time for riskier assets in recent weeks, including emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies. But few have felt the pain as much as frontier markets, a subset of smaller and often riskier emerging economies.  \n Many of those frontier economies are in Africa, and are suffering from a toxic combination of tumbling oil and commodity prices, the prospect of the global economy tumbling into recession and weakening currencies which will make servicing external debt ever-more expensive.  \n Oil-producing countries like Angola, Ghana, Gabon and Nigeria have seen their dollar-denominated debt drop sharply, with yields of some issues shooting above 20%, indicating soaring borrowing costs. Many countries on the continent lack the financial firepower or foreign currency reserves needed to combat the coronavirus and prop up their economies, with healthcare systems already under strain.  \n The World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged official bilateral creditors to provide immediate debt relief to the world\'s poorest countries as they grapple with the human and economic consequences of the pandemic.  \n Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies pledged on Thursday to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and "do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic", expressing concern about Africa in particular. Many hope that the acknowledgement of the need to bolster global financial safety nets and national health systems will translate into action.  \n  \n (Graphic: Africa\'s soaring borrowing costs, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3971/3927/Africa\'s%20soaring%20borrowing%20costs.jpg) REUTERS \n '

'888888,0,Berlin (dpa/tmn) How strongly does the Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 affect tourism? And in the face of the climate crisis, can I still go on vacation without a second thought?\nThese are two questions this year at the ITB Travel Fair in Berlin (4. to 8. May be discussed in a heated debate. The climate issue is a permanent burner for industry and travellers, and the virus is a new crisis.\nFear of Corona but still little impact\nWhat initially seemed like the local problem of a Chinese province has become an international threat: more and more people are getting sick and dying of Covid-19, the disease that the Coronavirus causes, especially in China itself. Flights to the Middle Kingdom were cancelled, cruise ships established in Asia.\n"China is not a major travel country from a German perspective," says tourism researcher Prof. Torsten Kirstges. But the virus could also have a significant negative impact on the surrounding countries in Asia. "An entire region could be under general suspicion," says the Jade University expert in Wilhelmshaven.\nConcerns lead to booking retention\nFirst signs of this are: Several German tour operators offer guests the option to cancel or convert for free until a few weeks before their trip to an Asian country, for example Thailand or Vietnam. This indicates that holidaymakers are beginning to avoid the region. Kirstges says that the new Coronavirus takes part of its uniqueness when travelling.\nAnd the ITB itself? Chinese exhibitors are also expected there, two have cancelled so far. "We are prepared, but not hysterical," says David Ruetz, head of ITB. The Corona crisis is also having an impact in this country: according to the German Tourist Office, the decline of Chinese visitors is partly evident in various cities and attractionsYeah.\nTravel and climate: good intentions instead of real renunciation\nShould we take less vacation in the face of the climate crisis? Or at least less flying? The ITB has put sustainability back on the agenda. "You cannot put travel under general suspicion," Ruetz says. Positive effects were often overlooked, such as the economic benefits for the countries travelled. The ITB was a platform for a fair discussion.\nAnd what do the vacationers think? The subject is being discussed. But almost no one actually changes their behavior. Prof. Kirstges puts the attitude of holidaymakers to the point: "Wash my fur, but don\'t make me wet." The guest wants to get the impression that the organizer or the hotel cares about sustainability. He won\'t give up on himself.\nFlying is harmful, yet everyone flies\n"All statistics show that this does not significantly affect travel behaviour, let alone that people no longer travel out of flight shame," says Kirstges. Travelling by plane is particularly harmful to the climate.\nBut can holidaymakers rely on their provider to be truly sustainable? "The industry is sensitive, but most providers do nothing voluntarily," says Kirstges. "No one deters customers without coercion and renounces sales."\nAfter the Brexit is before the Brexit\nAfter a long row it happened: Britain has 31st. Leave the EU in January. For travellers, however, this does not change anything: until the end of the year a transitional phase applies. Flights go as planned, you continue to come to England with an identity card. At ITB, therefore, Brexit should not be a major issue.\nIt is still unclear, however, how to proceed after 2020, for example in terms of flights from, to and through Britain. The German Travel Association considers a comprehensive air transport agreement necessarYeah. So can you book a flight over London to the USA for 2021, for example? "Yes, probably no problem," says Kirstges. "A solution will certainly be found there."\nLuxury travel and digitisation\nBoth topics are not new, but play a major role at ITB: the luxury travel segment and digitisation.\n"World-wide luxury travel is a 14-percent of tourism," says ITB director David Ruetz. There is a change "towards unattainable luxury, to experience, even to spirituality". So less bling-bling, but exclusive sensuality. One question for the fair will be: How do luxury and sustainability fit together?\nThe tourism industry also discusses how it can become more digital. It juggles with keywords such as Blockchain or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Kirstges points out that many organisers have not even managed to send regular newsletters. "Every year, digital high-tech saws are driven through the tourist village, but they usually run again quickly."\nInformation for visitors to the ITB Travel Fair\nThe ITB in Berlin is the largest and most important travel fair in the world. This year will be the 4th. to 8. In March around 10.000 exhibitors from more than 180 countries are expected in the exhibition halls around the radio tower. Trade visitors discuss important topics of the tourism industry from Wednesday to Friday. Private visitors are invited on Saturdays and Sundays to explore halls and exhibitors. This year\'s partner country is the Sultanate of Oman.\nThe daily ticket costs in the online shop 13 euros, there are 16 euros on site. Discounts are available for students and students, children under 14-year-olds do not pay admission. The fair is open to private individuals from 10.00 to 18.00. Schedule waiting times at the entrance. Last year, the fair was attended around 160.000Yeah.\nThe exhibition halls are accessible by S-Bahn, via the stations Messe Nord /ICC and Messe South. The red metro line 2 (Theodor-Heuss-Platz station) is also available. There are also fixed shuttle bus lines. Shuttle buses also run on the extensive exhibition grounds'

Lion Air spokesman Danang Mandala separately said he would also look into the case. \n Meanwhile, the Health Ministry\'s disease control and environmental health director-general, Mr Anung Sugihantono, said his office had not yet received the information and was still "confirming it" but he was quick to say that it was "a rumour". \n The ministry advises regular washing of hands, avoiding uncooked meat and wearing face masks when sick to minimise the chances of contracting the disease. \n The Jakarta Post first obtained the information about the Anhui administration\'s statement from a Chinese citizen who sent a letter on Wednesday. The citizen provided two links: one was the Weibo post and the other was a search page for "Epidemic situation, public transportation epidemic inquiry". \n The Post asked two Chinese journalists from two respected media in China to check whether the links are official or not and both confirmed that the links are official. \n The Chinese citizen who first informed the paper about the alert from the Anhui provincial authorities provided an English translation of the Weibo post and The Post also asked an Indonesian journalist friend who understands Chinese to translate it into Indonesian. \n The Post also ran a search with keyword "GA858" on the public transportation history site and found a result dated Jan 28 that contained a link to the Weibo post from Anhui. The newspaper also searched the site with the keyword "JT2618" but it did not show any result. \n The Post tried to contact the Anhui and Huainan CDC offices on Wednesday to find more information about the patient but calls were not answered. Indonesian Ambassador to China Djauhari Oratmangun told the Post he had yet to receive any information about the matter but he would find out more information. \n '

'888888,0,HONG KONG — Chinese health officials on Friday (Feb 7) sought to assuage a jittery public over the strength of the novel coronavirus which has sickened more than 31,200 people across the country. \n Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Dr Wang Guoqiang, an infectious disease expert at Peking University No 1 Hospital, said that preliminary data about people who had recovered after being infected was promising. \n Based on a small sample of discharged patients from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, Dr Wang said that about 6 per cent had recovered after being in a serious condition, while less than one per cent had recovered after being classed as in critical condition. \n “This shows that cases in serious and critical conditions can be treated and discharged from hospital after receiving proactive treatment, and that has given us great confidence,” he said. \n “We now have expert teams supporting Wuhan, especially those who have been transferred from intensive care units. \n “I think this will greatly reduce the mortality of patients in critical condition and improve the recovery rate,” he said. \n Ms Guo Yanhong, a senior inspector with the National Health Commission, said at the briefing that the addition of “medical shelters” in Wuhan — which will provide 4,600 beds once completed — would greatly help in the treatment of patients with mild symptoms, and prevent them from developing complications and aggravating their illness. \n “Our capacity to treat patients is significantly boosted by these medical shelters… enabling us to lower infections,” she said. \n Dr Wang said the new shelters would “enable us to segregate the patients, ensure they are properly isolated and hence preventing infection, and also allow us to better identify patients who may have the risk of becoming critically ill”\n. \n The new coronavirus, which was first reported in Wuhan in December, has killed 638 people — all but two of them in mainland China — and sickened more than 31,500 people globally. As of Friday, more than 1,600 people had recovered after being infected. \n Dr Hitoshi Oshitani, a virology professor from Tohoku University in Japan, said it was promising that some critically ill patients had recovered. \n “[Mortality] is definitely much lower than Sars. The true figure may be even lower. But it is also definitely higher than seasonal influenza,” he said referring to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed about 800 people around the world in 2002-03. \n But Dr Oshitani called on China to make more real-time data available. \n “For example, we want to know what is happening in major cities such as Chongqing. This is critically important in predicting what is going to happen in other cities such as Tokyo,” he said. \n As well as figures for confirmed cases, those in serious condition and discharged, Dr Oshitani said it would be useful to have data on how many patients had been infected because of local transmission or were imported cases from Wuhan as that would hold the key to determining whether the spread of the virus was controllable. \n “If most of them are still imported cases from Wuhan, they may be able to control the situation. If there is a widespread local transmission, it is totally different,” he said. \n The most recent figures, released on Tuesday, showed that about 60 per cent of Chongqing’s cases were imported and 40 per cent were locally transmitted. \n But locally transmitted cases had begun to overtake imported cases, the local health commission said. \n Dr Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at Duke University in the United States, said that without population-based studies, metrics such as pathogenicity, the percentage of those who develop severe disease among the infected, and mortality may not be precise\n. \n “I think many epidemiologists suspect the estimates for 2019-nCoV disease severity are a bit exaggerated,” he said, using the official name of the virus. \n “Metrics like pathogenicity and mortality are falsely elevated because infected people with few or no symptoms are not being counted in the denominators.” \n But Dr Gray also acknowledged that there were people in China suspected of contracting the coronavirus but who had not been tested. They would not be counted in the statistics, which further complicated the assessment of the disease, he said. SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n'
"888888,0,The Chinese conglomerate HNA, which in March 2019 left the capital of TAP, called on the government of the Chinese island province of Hainan, where it is based, to lead a working group that avoids insolvency. The financial situation of the group, which was difficult several months ago, was rapidly worsened by the restrictions imposed by the new coronavirus in the last month, in terms of air travel and tourism, on the main business of the Chinese holding company.\nThis Saturday, February 29, it was the company itself that, through its official WeChat social network account, took over the growing risk of liquidity shortages on its own, as Reuters reported.\nHNA is a shareholder in several passenger and cargo air transport companies, including Hainan Airlines and Beijing Capital Airlines, which continues to call, once a week, Lisbon and Beijing.\nReuters argues that the working group now set up is led by Gu Gang, president of Hainan Development Holdings, an investment company owned by the local government of Hainan. The team also includes representatives from the Hainan Economic Development Area, the civil aviation authority from central and southern China and the China Development Bank. According to the news agency, one of the hypotheses on the table is for the Chinese government to take control of HNA and then divest its assets.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the most profound works of the publiYeah.\nHNA was one of the most aggressive Chinese groups to invest in acquisitions, having spent nearly fifty billion dollars (45 billion euros) around the world, gathering assets such as the Hilton Worldwide hotel chain, shares in banks (came to have 10% of Deutsche Bank) and companies in its area of business in other countries (such as TAP, of which it was a shareholder via 20% of the Atlantic Gateway consortium, owner of 45% of the Portuguese airline).\nEven before the new coronavirus outbreak was known last December, HNA President Chen Feng admitted that the company was having cash difficulties, which would even lead to late payment of wages at the end of last year, but believed that the situation would resolve in 2020. Bloomberg estimates that by mid-2019 the group's debt would already have fallen, but was in 525,6 billion yuan (about 81 billion euro at present).\nWith the advent of the new coronavirus and the restrictions imposed by the Chinese authorities and the World Health Organisation (WHO), Hainan Airlines and other more directly affected companies have attempted to mitigate their losses, for example by placing foreign workers on unpaid leave, Reuters explains. But there is nothing to protect them from a drastic reduction in demand and compensation claims for flights that have not yet been carried out"

'888888,1,"I have clients in panic because they do not know how to get their supplies," says this Monday to the Express, from Brazil, the president of the National Association of Clothing and Confetti Industries (ANIVEC/APIV), Cesar Araujo. Customers understand brands, many of them multinationals, that need products to put them on the market. And the cause of this panic is the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has paralyzed much of China and is now hitting northern Italy hard.\nCesar Araujo is also chairman of the board of directors at Calvelex, a company in the sector that has a large part of its production dedicated to brands directed to the luxury market. Calvelex suspended part of the production last week, as usual at the time, underlines the administrator, but seeking to catch breath and save raw materials- some were already short- for a period of more orders.\n"For example, silk comes from Asia and China. As much as I want to, I will not find a supplier who can supply it,"he says. And the decrease in orders is also a problem: "In this sector, for some customers the Chinese market is the first and for others it is the second. With these curfew measures, people do not consume either. It is possible that production may have to be stopped because some factories depend on these supplies."\nThe President of ANIVEC advances to the Express that there are talks with the Ministries of Labour and Economics, as well as with the State Secretariat of Internationalisation (which depends on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to find ways to find solutions and "anticipate problems in the supply chain".\nCaesar Araujo points to the fact that several airlines have ceased to fly to China and that port inspections are lengthy as two more factors of difficulty in regularizing the situatioYeah. And be warned: the stocks of raw materials of the companies in the sector at best last six weeks, so production is already at stake for the coming weeks.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak hit two nerve regions not only for this sector, but also for clothing and footwear. "China produces more than 20% of the tradable goods in the world, something like this has a global impact. Italy is also a major producer of raw materials and brands", underlined\nMicam, Mipele and Lineapelle: The three shoe fairs that took place last week in Milan, Italy are called, and where there were around 400 Portuguese, representing more than 100 companies in the sector, confirmed to the Expresso Paulo Goncalves, communications director of APICCAPS, the Portuguese Association of Industrial Footwear, Components, Skin Articles and their Sucleons.\nIn luggage, the association has given instructions to its associates on the coronavirus, according to what the World Health Organisation and the Directorate-General for Health recommend to travellers these days, and none of them have given up on participation, notes the person responsible. Almost everyone will have returned to Portugal by Friday, before the escalation in Italy, where there have already been seven deaths. At Malpensa Airport, there was a temperature check on who arrived and further instructions were given, but there was still no widespread concern on Monday.\nThese are not common measures, but they have not caused much disturbance to visitors of the events. The difference was within the fairs, where there was less "20% of travellers" and much less Asians. "I would venture to say that there was none there," says Paul Goncalves. Therefore, despite everything taking place in a "normal" climate, there is some apprehension in the Portuguese footwear industry: "For a sector that exports 98% of production to virtually everyone, this is always a sign of some concerYeah. We anticipate results that cannot be good".\n"At the moment we have no dramatic situation. Of course we are apprehensive when things do not go the way we want and there are possible breakdowns, we are not unconscious and the textile needs several components to continue working. There are signs coming from China that things will be resolved, we hope so", declares to Mario Jorge Machado, the President of Portugal\'s Textile and Clothing Association (ATP).\nThe leader of ATP first stresses that the situation in Italy is "very recent" and that it arises in the context of Carnival holidays, where much of the textile factories in Portugal are at a standstill. "We must now wait a little longer and se e if there is a need for some sort of measure to prevent some kind of problem with northern Italy, which, from the point of view of the whole of Europe, is a very important point of trade," he said.\nMario Jorge Machado is already able to be more specific about possible problems due to the situation in China, where the new coronavirus was initially detected. In this case, the fear is that there is a shortage of raw materials and components, namely synthetic yarn, some labels, plastic accessories, zippers, a situation that has not yet occurred among ATP members.\n"The information we have is that production in China is being resumed only with local staff, some of them are about thirty percent from their capacity. Let\'s hope he\'s normalizing,"he adds.\nIf Portuguese textiles manage to keep their normal operation, Mario Jorge Machado even anticipates that some orders for units in China can be made in Portugal\n"I have felt in recent days, particularly in MODtissimo [the textile salon held this Wednesday and Thursday at Port Airport], that buyers of several Portuguese brands have made more orders to avoid being exposed to more geo-health and geopolitical issueYeah. As the popular saying goes, they don\'t want to put all their eggs in the same basket,"he says.\nAs regards footwear, the problems with raw materials do not torment industrialists so much. China is not a "first-line supplier" of the industry, except "some accessories and buckles", explains Paul Goncalvlves of APICCAPS. On the other hand, footwear works in Portugal as a\'cluster\'in which there are several companies for various types of components, ensuring continuity of production.\nAs for the markets concerned, they are also not of the first order: the footwear industry exports around 40 million euros to Italy and a little less to China and Hong Kong (30 million). To understand the proportion, exports to France reach the 400 million euros and to the US at the 100 million euro.\nIn terms of international fairs, the Asian market is usually dealt with only by APICCAPS from April onwards. "We have some actions in Tokyo planned, we will have to see how the next few weeks go. For now everything is more or less in accordance with normality, but objectively no one can make predictions.'

This is to prevent the Coronavirus from spreading in the reception area.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON - A war of words between China and the United States showed no signs of let up on Monday, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call with a top Chinese diplomat expressing "strong U.S. objections" over what Washington sees as Beijing\'s efforts to shift blame for the spread of the coronavirus.  \n Ties between the world\'s top two economies, already complicated due to issues including trade, intellectual property rights as well as press freedoms, have further been tested by the outbreak of coronavirus, which causes the sometimes fatal, highly contagious respiratory illness COVID-19.  \n "Secretary Pompeo conveyed strong U.S. objections to PRC efforts to shift blame for COVID-19 to the United States," Morgan Ortagus, State Department spokeswoman said in a statement about Pompeo\'s call with Yang Jiechi, director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the Communist Party of China.  \n "The Secretary stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumors, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat," Ortagus said.  \n The United States on Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan. David Stilwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very "stern representation" to China\'s ambassador Cui Tiankai.  \n Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Monday that in the phone call Yang told Pompeo that attempts to smear China\'s efforts to control the coronavirus "will not succeed" and that actions that harmed China\'s interests would be retaliated against.  \n The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has spread around the world, upended many countries\' daily lives, pummeled financial markets, brought flights to a standstill, shut down schools and forced the postponement of almost all gatherings including sports and arts events.  \n Globally over 174,100 have been infected and nearly 6,700 have died. U.S. death toll reached 71, with more than 4,100 people having tested positive for the disease.  \n Beijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people.  \n Pompeo, who has sharply criticised Beijing on a number of issues from its trade practices to religious freedoms, has complained that the U.S. response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.  \n However on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised China for its "data sharing" and appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

'888888,0,The World Health Organisation Emergency Committee (WHO) meets again this Thursday in Geneva, Switzerland to decide whether to declare the outbreak of the new coronavirus from China as an international public health emergency. The committee met on Wednesday but did not reach a consensus on the matter.\nThe coronavirus, identified as 2019-nCoV, was detected in December and already caused at least 17 deaths in 616, according to the Chinese authorities. There are already two cities in the country in isolation: Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, and Huanggang, about 70 kilometers away.\n"The role of the WHO is to ensure that the global public health response to any new outbreak is rapid, robust and comprehensive, especially taking into account the geographical distribution of cases," says Jeremy Farrar, director of the non-governmental organisation (NGOs) Wellcome, dedicated to health research.\nIn statements to the Express from Davos, where he participates in the World Economic Forum, the NGO director stresses that "this outbreak is extremely worrying". "Person to person transmission has been confirmed and, as expected, there are an increasing number of cases in China and other countries with infected healthcare workers," he added.\nThe virus is transmitted between animals and passed on to humans. However, the circumstances of the transmission from person to person are not yet fully substantiated. The first cases arose in Wuhan in central China and are believed to have originated in a market for seafood and meat from Huanan in that city.\nOutside mainland China, cases were confirmed in South Korea, the USA, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Thailand and Taiwan.\n"A major concern is the variety of symptoms this virus is causing\nYeah. Some people are being affected and are infectious, although they have only very mild symptoms or possibly not showing any symptoms,"Jeremy Farrar warned. It suggests, "This may be masking the true number of infected and the extent of the transmission from person to person."\nIn recent days, the spectrum of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has returned, which has infected more than eight thousand people and killed nearly 800 in a pandemic that has spread across Asia between 2002 and 2003. Wellcome\'s director recalls, however, that "the speed with which this virus has been identified is evidence of changes in public health in China since SARS and of strong global coordination through WHO".\n"The world is much better prepared to identify patients and adopt the necessary clinical and public health measures than during SARS. However, we still do not understand this virus or its clinical impact and public health. We also have no proven vaccines or treatments yet,"says Jeremy Farrar. "The CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), which Wellcome supports, is currently working with global partners to accelerate the search for a vaccine for this new virus", it ensures.\nPending further deliberation by the WHO, which has declared an international public health emergency for the epidemics of H1N1 influenza, polio and Zika-Ebola viruses, Macao authorities have cancelled the Lunar New Year celebrations. The measure had already been adopted by the local authorities of Wuhan. The New Year, which starts this Saturday, is a very special date in the Chinese calendar and takes hundreds of millions of people travelling around the country.\nIn Portugal, the Director General for Health (DGS), thanks to nuns, reported this Wednesday that "there are no suspicious cases", so there is no alarm situation.\nAs a precaution, DGS is "paying more attention" to the seven cases exported from mainland China\nYeah. Public health devices have already been deployed, with hospitals in San Juan, Oporto and Curry Cabral and Stephania in Lisbon on alert.\n'

This is the summary of a dozen contacts made by the public to agencies and operators organising and marketing senior trips. None are officially ready to proceed with refunds and, although, as SporYoung\'s manager said, if there are "enough" calls from concerned parents, there are no cancellations.\nAlso because the note from the Directorate-General for School Settlements (Dgeste), published this Wednesday, only "advises" to consider visits by students abroad (in general) and Prime Minister Costa said that "it might be advisable to avoid" making such trips.

During those days, all the accommodation units of the Valencian tourist complex are booked by the company, so "the destination will only have Portuguese tourists", says the responsible one. So far, says the coordinator, Rita Veiga, have not received any request for cancellation of the reservation. The responsible officer indicates that she is in "daily contact with the Portuguese and local authorities [Spanish] and the Portuguese Tourism" and that, to date, they have not received any indication from any of these authorities to cancel the programme.\nRita Veiga further argues that if the event were cancelled by the authorities, it would be necessary "to see Portugal\'s Tourism and the companies that have signed the health insurance of each student on whom responsibility falls" of the reimbursements.\nAs for cases of cancellation before such indication, SporYoung coordinator refers to the general conditions published on the company website. They state that "cancellations made less than thirty days, including the date of commencement of the journey, have 100% expenses and no value is reimbursed. With more than thirty days the customer will have to pay a minimum value of 70 per person."\nOne month from March to April, the event is already "all booked and paid for". However, Rita Veiga says "no figures" about possible damage from accommodation to transport, as well as the performers who are part of the programme". A change in the fate of the event is not on the table, but the agency may "consider changing the dates"Yeah.\nAlso in the process of weighing are large companies selling senior trips, in the case of the Abreu Agency which, after the initial publication of this article, sent the PUBLIC a written comment: "We have several customers calling or visiting our shops and asking questions about whether they can or should cancel," refers to the commercial director of the agency, Pedro Quintela.\nStressing that it clarifies and proceeds with cancellations and reimbursements "for destinations considered by the World Health Organisation and referred to in the Community Portal as risk destinations" (since 24/01, China, Hong and Macao; since the last weekend in Northern Italy), the responsible, As far as the senior programmes are concerned, it is already sending them to another general field, namely the package of trips to destinations which have not yet been officially considered to be at risk. "We will examine on a case-by-case basis, managing the risk-based situations defined by the WHO. Other destinations other than those defined (by the WHO) will always have to be analysed and discussed,"he stressed. The general practice in this case: if "a customer wants to cancel a tourist package (...) it will only be repaid the value between the cost of the trip and the cost that the Travel Agency has already or will have with that program,"also depending on the additional insurance cover that the customer may have purchased".\nIn the field of the most specialized, such as the Travel Wing, which promotes eight alternate destinations for the finalists, there was still no clear position, with the company studying the subject and expecting official restrictions.

"The big reserves are now starting in March, Easter is in April and there is no expectation of a spike in reserves with this whole environment, which has not yet reached its peak," he said, noting that "the Easter effect will have a negative effect on the sector. Because, of course, if there are no reserves and there are no travel there will be less revenue, less billing."\nAs the aim is to ensure the "safety of Portuguese students", the National Youth Council (CNJ), in which several student associations also sit, indicated that it "subscribes" to the warning made by Dgeste.\nAs regards the dilemma open with travel agencies regarding a possible reimbursement of payments already made by households, Rita Saias considers that "it is not for the CNJ to decide on specific cases in this context", but leaves another warning: "This is just one more showing the need to review the model of the overall senior trip."\nFor their part, the two national confederations of parents\'associations have already called for "common sense" from the agencies contracted for the senior excursions. The destination of many senior trips is usually South Spain, where several cases of infection are already confirmed. "This is not only about the safety of pupils, but also about the national interest in controlling the spread of the disease," said the President of the National Confederation of Parents\'Associations (Confap), George AscentioYeah.\n"If I had already paid, I would rather be without the money than risk my daughter contracting the infection," said the president of the Independent Confederation of Parents and Education Trustees (CNIPE), Rui Martins, which hopes, however, that a position of "common sense on all sides will prevail in order to minimise the damage to all".\nOn the other hand, the Portuguese Association for Consumer Protection, Deco refers to a text with general advice on coronavirus and travel, even without specifying anything specific about senior trips. As some agency officials have commented, the online document on package travel highlights the right to reimbursement at China and Northern Italy destinations. "The law allows the traveler to terminate the contract at any time before starting the journey. And it will not have to pay the travel agency any cancellation fee, because there are exceptional circumstances at or near the place of destination that significantly affect the carrying out of the planned journey."\nBut: "This is the only way it will be in relation to the destinations severely affected by the virus. In relation to travel insurance, in "none of the policies analysed if it considers force majeure to cancel the trip for fear of contagion", says Deco. "Therefore, we cannot generally say that travel insurance can be activated due to the coronavirus. It depends on the policy and the situation to be ensured, such as the payment of medical expenses for those who have been infected during a journey, or the reimbursement of expenses for cancelling a trip, for example. Without directives expressed to other destinations, it is "impossible to give a single answer to these questions".\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the most profound works of the publiYeah.\n52 suspicious cases have so far been reported in Portugal, 36 of which have been negative after laboratory tests, and results are expected from the remaining 16s.

'888888,0,NEW YORK — As the number of people infected with the coronavirus surpasses 450,000 worldwide, and more than 1 billion are locked in their homes, scientists are wrestling with one of the most pressing questions of the pandemic: Do people who survive the infection become immune to the virus? \n The answer is a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns. That’s important for several reasons. \n People who are confirmed to be immune could venture from their homes and help shore up the workforce until a vaccine becomes available, for example. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for the severely ill. \n Growing immunity in the community also is the way the epidemic ends: With fewer and fewer people to infect, the coronavirus will lose its toehold and even the most vulnerable citizens become more insulated from the threat. \n Immunity may also bring an early treatment. Antibodies gathered from the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called Covid-19. \n On Tuesday (March 24), the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. A day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York would become the first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from Covid-19 to treat those who are seriously ill. \n “It’s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York’s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,” Mr Cuomo said. \n The body’s first line of defence against an infectious virus is an antibody called immunoglobulin M, whose job is to stay vigilant in the body and alert the rest of the immune system to intruders like viruses and bacteria. \n Days into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a second type, called immunoglobulin G, exquisitely designed to recognise and neutralize a specific virus. \n The refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the potency of the final antibodies can vary. Some people make powerful neutralising antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder response. \n The antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses — polio or measles, for example — bestow a lifetime of immunity. But antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for just one to three years — and that may be true of their new cousin as well. \n A study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that once infected, the monkeys produce neutralising antibodies and resist further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people infected with the virus, will remain immune. \n Most people who became infected during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic — that virus is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called Sars-CoV-2 — had long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said Dr Vineet D. Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. \n Those who recovered from Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), another coronavirus, saw much shorter-term protection, Dr Menachery said. People who have been infected with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two years, he added: “Beyond that, we can’t predict.” \n Still, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people become reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be much milder than the first, said Dr Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \n Even after the body stops producing neutralising antibodies, a subset of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted. \n “You probably would make a good immune response before you even become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the disease,” Dr Krammer said. \n A crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the virus until a vaccine is available. \n Dr Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients and health care workers. \n The researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100 people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses known to cause the common cold. \n If those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus, too, Dr Koopmans said, it might explain why some people — children, for example — have only mild symptoms. They may have antibodies to related coronaviruses that are at last somewhat effective against the new one. \n The quickest way to assess immunity is a blood test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test. \n Antibody tests are used in Singapore, China and a handful of other countries. But they are just coming to market in much of the West. \n Last week, Dr Krammer and his colleagues developed one such antibody test that could be scaled up in “days to weeks”, he said. \n The team validated the test in blood plasma taken from three patients with Covid-19. The researchers are seeking speedy approval from the FDA. \n Dozens of other labs are also at work on a dizzying list of tests, although they, too, are mostly based on slim data that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. \n “No matter who makes them, as long as they’re reliable, that’s a super nice tool,” Dr Krammer said. Because this is a new coronavirus, the test should deliver “basically, a yes or no answer, like an HIV test — you can figure out who was exposed and who wasn’t”. \n On Wednesday, officials of Public Health England said they had purchased millions of newly developed antibody tests and were evaluating them for patients to use at home. Citizens who discovered they had been exposed and now had some immunity to the coronavirus might be able to return to normal lives, the officials said. \n That would be particularly useful for health care workers. Those who know they have at least some immunity could be placed on the front lines of emergency care, sparing colleagues who have not been exposed. \n “If this really goes on for months at a time, for 18 months as some people have projected, having health care workers who are immune to the virus will be really, really helpful,” said Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. \n But tests like these may not be of much use for diagnosis of coronavirus infection as it gets underway, because of the time it takes for the body to begin producing antibodies. \n Dr Krammer’s test picks up an antibody response as early as three days after symptoms emerge. Given that people may not show symptoms for as long as 14 days after infection, however, that is too late for the test to be useful as a diagnostic tool. \n Finding people with powerful antibody responses might help point the way to new treatments, however. Essentially, antibodies extracted from the blood of recovered patients are injected into those who are ill. \n Several teams have already been working on such an effort, following early reports from China of success. A Beijing-based company called AnyGo Technology has provided 50,000 tests to the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and to hospitals in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, according to its founder, Dr Le Sun. \n Dr Shangen Zheng, a doctor with the Chinese military, said his team had treated more than 10 patients so far, and data from many more patients treated with plasma in Hubei province is being assessed. \n This approach is actually “something very old-fashioned”, Dr Krammer said. It was used to save American soldiers infected with the hemorrhagic Hantaan virus during the Korean War, and to treat people in Argentina infected with the hemorrhagic Junin virus. \n Before the method can be put into wide use, however, scientists must work out safety issues, such as ensuring that the plasma taken from recovered patients is free of other viruses and toxins. \n Pharmaceutical companies like Takeda and Regeneron are hoping to sidestep some of those questions by developing antibodies against the coronavirus in the laboratory. \n Ultimately, it is only with these tests that scientists will be able to say when enough of the population has been infected and has become immune — and when the virus has begun to run out of hosts.

'888888,0,In Germany there is the first case of the Coronavirus. There is no reason to panic, says Oliver Witzke, director of the Infectiology Clinic and the West German Center for Infectiology of University Medicine Essen. "It was to be expected that we had individual cases in Germany. In this respect, it is pointless to worry about it."\nAnd yet there is some uncertainty-- am I at risk, do I have to protect myself? Overview of the main questions and answers:\nMany medical facts about the new Coronavirus are still unclear: the rate of infection, for example, including aggression. The latter seems to be lower than for example in the Sars epidemic 2002/2003. "We are talking about a case in Germany that has been quickly identified," says Witzke. This is in no way in relation to the flu that is currently raging. "At which, every year, around 20.000 people die alone in Germany."\nNo, and yes. Because even if there is no reason to be afraid of the Coronavirus in Germany, it makes sense to protect yourself from infectious diseases, especially in view of the current flu wave. Witzke therefore also recommends a flu control. It doesn\'t just protect you from the flu. This cannot be confused with lung disease.\nThe best remedy for infectious respiratory diseases, whether flu, coronary virus or cold, is hygiene. So much washing of hands, little shaking of hands, and careful sneezing and coughing. "If you can\'t suppress it, sneeze in your sleeves or elbows to protect the environment," jokes say. A respiratory mask is not a suitable protection measure for uninfected people. "Running away now and buying them would be a senseless panic reaction."\nThe Robert Koch Institute and the Federal Centre for Health Education have published websites with answers to the most important questions\nYeah. For telephone enquiries, the health insurance company Barmer has set up a free hotline (0800 84 84 111) to answer questions from all federal citizens around the clock, not just those of its own customers.\nImportant to know: a snoring is not an alarm sign for a possible infection with the Coronavirus. Typical symptoms are dry cough, fever, fatigue, even shortness of breath. It is also clear that those who are ill should see a doctor.\nBut you shouldn\'t overdo it. "In situations like this, there is a danger that people who have nothing will suddenly be in the emergency room," Witzke says. This jeopardises the emergency system. "If you are worried about being infected with the Coronavirus for any reason, the emergency room is not the right point of contact, but the local health department."\n'
'888888,0,BAGHDAD (Iraq) — Iraqi and Kuwaiti authorities were on high alert Friday (Feb 21)\xa0after banning travel the previous day to and from Iran, where authorities say the death toll from the new coronavirus has hit four. \n Iran\'s health ministry Friday reported two more deaths among 13 new diagnosed cases of the COVID-19 virus, doubling the total number of deaths in the Islamic republic and taking the total number of diagnosed infections there to 18. \n Since December, the virus has killed more than 2,200 people in China, the epidemic\'s epicentre. \n Elsewhere in the world, it has killed over a dozen people and spread across some 26 countries. \n In the Middle East, two elderly men in Iran were the first confirmed deaths from the virus, which has also spread to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel, which confirmed its first case on Friday.\xa0 \n Both Iraq and Kuwait, which respectively share land and maritime borders with Iran, have not confirmed any cases of the virus internally. \n But the outbreak in the Islamic Republic has sparked alarm, especially since many of the coronavirus cases involved residents of the holy city of Qom, a popular destination for Kuwaiti and Iraqi Shiites.\xa0 \n Shiite leader Moqtada Sadr, a major figure in Iraqi politics, himself studies in an Islamic seminary in Qom.\xa0 \n Iraq is a popular destination for millions of Iranian Shiite pilgrims, including religious scholars from Qom, who visit holy sites in the southern provinces of Najaf and Karabala. \n Iran is also the second-largest exporter of goods to Iraq, sending products to the value of around nine billion dollars annually. \n SISTANI URGES PREPARATION \n Iraq\'s top Shiite cleric on Friday called on authorities to be ready to stem any outbreak. \n "The scale of preparations should match that of the threat," said Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani in his weekly sermon delivered by a representative. \n "We call on relevant authorities to be up to the level of responsibility". \n A key player in Iraq, Iran supplies Baghdad with the energy it desperately needs to combat chronic power cuts and wields sizable influence over political and paramilitary factions in the country.\xa0 \n American threats of sanctions and tit-for-tat bombings between US and Iranian forces on Iraq\'s soil have done little to stem the movement of people and goods between Tehran and Baghdad.\xa0 \n The COVID-19 virus, however, has triggered unprecedented measures.\xa0 \n Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from the Islamic republic, with Iraq\'s health ministry announcing people in Iran were barred from entering the country "until further notice". \n "Iranians are prohibited from entering (Iraq)," a senior official told AFP, adding that border crossings with Iran had been closed, with only returning Iraqis allowed to pass through. \n Those Iraqis would be examined and, if necessary, placed in quarantine for 14 days, the health ministry said. \n Iraqi nationals are also not allowed to travel to Iran, according to the ministry. \n The border closure followed a backlash against a Wednesday announcement of visa waivers for Iranian nationals wishing to travel to Iraq. \n Iraqis took to social media using the hashtag "close the border" and local officials called for a ban on the entry of goods and people. \n Iraqi airports were already screening travellers for the virus and national carrier Iraqi Airways has suspended flights to Iran.\xa0 \n Iraq had previously issued a ban on the entry of Chinese nationals. \n In Kuwait, national carrier Kuwait Airways announced Thursday it would suspend all flights to Iran, while its ports will also be closed to passengers travelling to and from the country.\xa0 \n Kuwaitis were advised not to travel to Qom, and were warned anyone arriving from the city they would be quarantined. \n SOCIAL MEDIA STORM \n Social media networks have become fertile ground for fears among Iraqis who say the healthcare system —\xa0 battered by waves of conflict —\xa0 cannot accomodate a coronavirus outbreak. \n Hospitals are generally poorly equipped in terms of equipment and medicine, while some still require reconstruction and refurbishment. \n More than 20,000 doctors have left the country since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, according to health professionals.\xa0 \n There are less than 10 doctors for every 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.\xa0 \n Iraqis are circulating prayers on social media networks, while videos circulating online showed Iraqi and Iranian families lighting incense in their homes with the belief that it will prevent infection.\xa0 \n Some said they were turning to herbalists for natural remedies, while others joked that alcohol consumption could combat the virus.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States and China on Monday (March 16) each demanded that the other stop smearing its reputation over the novel coronavirus as the pandemic became the latest row between the powers. \n The clash came on the day that the World Health Organisation said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China, where the new coronavirus virus was first detected late last year. \n US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels "to shift blame for Covid-19 to the United States", the State Department said. \n Mr Pompeo "stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat", the department added. \n The State Department last Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador, Mr Cui Tiankai, to denounce Beijing\'s promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media. \n Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in tweets last week in both Mandarin and English, suggested that "patient zero" in the global pandemic may have come from the US - not the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. \n "It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation," tweeted Mr Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media. \n Scientists suspect that the virus first came to humans at a meat market in Wuhan that butchered exotic animals. \n Mr Pompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to Sars-CoV-2 as the "Wuhan virus" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatising. \n Mr Yang issued a "stern warning to the United States that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail," the official Xinhua news agency said in its summary of the call with Pompeo. \n The key Chinese foreign policy leader "noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatised the country, which has enraged the Chinese people", Xinhua said. \n "He urged the US side to immediately correct its wrongful behaviour and stop making groundless accusations against China." \n US President Donald Trump, under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his allies have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners. \n Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a Trump ally, has spoken of the "Chinese coronavirus" and in a recent statement vowed, "we will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world". \n While Covid-19 - the disease caused by the virus - has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries. \n The pandemic comes at a time of wide-ranging tensions between the US and China on issues from trade to human rights to Beijing\'s military buildup. \n '

'888888,0,Within five days, since Saturday, the number of infected with the new coronavirus in Europe has skyrocketed from five dozen to more than 450; the number of deaths from one to 14. And with the arrival of the coronavirus in Brazil, with a confirmation this Wednesday in Sao Paulo, Antarctica becomes the only continent without cases. This has entered a new phase in which Covid-19 is already spreading more rapidly around the world than in China.\nEven if the acceleration of the outbreak is causing concern within the European Union (EU), the situation is not, for the moment, cause for panic: the EU has again ensured on Tuesday that it is working "on all fronts" to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in Europe, insisting on the need for coordination of the Member States "in real time" to tackle a phenomenon that is "dynamic".\nThe European Commission has reinforced that the key is for the EU as a whole to be "ready" for a possible increase in the epidemic, both in terms of treatment and in terms of containing the outbreak. One of the most sensitive issues linked to increased cases, particularly the situation in Italy, is border control, which the Commission has emphasised is not within its competence, but that of each Member State. However, such a scenario is not discarded either.\nItaly is the country most concerned by the European health authorities. This is because there has been a sudden increase in positive cases since Friday: only three people infected with the virus were accounted for on that day, but that number has since risen to 400 infected. This Wednesday was also confirmed as the twelfth victim in the country.\nThe Italian authorities are increasingly trying to tighten the siege on Covid-19: the containment measures announced this weekend for ten locations where they live for around fifty thousand people remain in forcYeah. V, Piedmont and Lombardy in northern Italy are the critical regions located in the red zone.\nFor the time being, the death pattern in Italy is similar to that in China. Older people with associated diseases, such a s cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, are being most affected.\nAfter Italy, Germany remains the European country with the most cases, but without new infections. France has already confirmed a total of 17 infected in the country and a second fatality: a 60-year-old French man died at dawn in Paris after being diagnosed. Norway, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Northern Macedonia and Greece have also confirmed new cases of infection.\nSo far, the only known case of a Portuguese infected by the new virus is that of Adriano Maranh o, the crewman of a cruise ship who was admitted to a Japanese hospital in Okazaki, about thirty miles from Tokyo. All suspected cases detected in Portugal (until this Wednesday were 18) were negative.\nThe virus that has already made more than 2760 dead (most of them in China) is now spreading at the highest speed around the world and there are already people infected in more than 40 countries. In addition to deaths in mainland China, victims are reported in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, France and Taiwan.\nThis Wednesday, China reported 52 deaths, the smallest daily increase in three weeks, while reporting 406 new cases, most in Hubei province. The number of new patients thus recorded a fall of 20%, compared to Monday, for example. According to the updated data by the Chinese National Health Commission, the country is adding more than 2700 dead and 78 thousand confirmed cases. Among the infected, more than 45 thousand were still active and more than 8500 patients were in serious condition. On the other hand, almost thirty thousand people have already been releaseYeah.\nAlthough Iran is the country with the most deaths from the new coronavirus after China, 139 cases of infection have been reported only last week and 19 people have died, President Hassan Rouhani said his government is not planning to quarantine cities and districts of the country.\nHowever, the authorities have already closed schools and some universities and admit to extending this decision for a few more days. There are also plans to restrict access to Shiite sacred sites this Friday. On the other hand, 11 countries have already "closed" their land and air borders with Iran (neighbouring Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Armenia, and other countries in the region such a s Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Georgia).\nAvoiding panic is one of the key messages from the World Health Organisation (WHO): the organisation\'s public health director, Maria Neira, assured this Wednesday that it is "irrational and disproportionate" that masks and disinfectants are exhausted in pharmacies for fear of coronavirus. In statements to the Spanish broadcaster RAC-1, Neira recalled that masks are for the use of health personnel and stressed that the decrease of victims and diseases occurring in China "may mean that the epidemic has reached the summit and reached the epidemic peak". On the other hand, Bruce Aylward, the specialist who led the WHO team sent to China, warned that the planet is "not ready" to face a pandemic of this new coronavirus.\nAs for the preparation of our country, the Foreign Minister, has assured us that we are prepared for a possible entry of the Covid-19 coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva mentioned this Wednesday that there is a contingency plan ready to be activated in Portugal. However, it stressed that this is a global problem requiring concerted action, mainly at European levelYeah.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs already announced, Portugal is strengthening prevention measures and the network of available laboratories and hospitals to receive suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus. In terms of future measures, the Portuguese Government does not rule out the closure of borders, but has strengthened that it will only do so together with the European Union, in line with the intentions of the European Commission.\nThe pneumologist and coordinator of the crisis office of the Order of Physicians, Filipe Froes, said this Wednesday to Lusa that, compared to the response capacity for influenza A ten years ago, there is now "less hospital response capacity, less human resources and less differentiation". "The challenge will be much greater, but it must also be adjusted to the transmission of the disease, to the number of Portuguese affected and to gravity," he said, stressing that "the challenge at this time is still unknown"'

The room has also been sealed.\xa0\xa0 \n Speaking to the media on Thursday night (Jan 23) hours after a media briefing by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Mr Josef Dolp, the executive vice-president of operations for Southeast Asia and Australasia of Shangri-La Group, also said that the four hotel employees who cleaned the man’s room and served the guests have been isolated. \n The 66-year-old man, who lives in Wuhan, arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Monday night and was travelling with nine other companions. \n He stayed at Rasa Sentosa until Wednesday and during this period, he fell ill and notified the hotel’s staff members.\xa0\xa0 \n He went by taxi to the Singapore General Hospital on Wednesday and has been isolated after he was admitted.\xa0 \n The hotel had put in place precautionary measures even before Jan 20, the day that the man checked into the hotel.\xa0 \n Mr Dolp said of what happened after the man left for the hospital: “We isolated our staff and we asked them to stay at home and wear masks and wait for the result.” \n On Thursday evening, the man tested positive for the new coronavirus that has killed 17 in China and infected hundreds in other countries, with cases reported in Japan, South Korea Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. The latest country after Singapore to confirm its first case is Vietnam.\xa0 \n CONTRACT TRACING \n With the results confirmed, Mr Dolp said that the Government is aware of the identities of the four isolated hotel employees and their conditions are being monitored by the Government as well.\xa0 \n The hotel will support MOH’s efforts in contact tracing beyond the four workers, through the use of surveillance footage and so forth, he added\n.\xa0 \n  Mr Josef Dolp, the executive vice-president of operations for Southeast Asia and Australasia of Shangri-La Group, said that hotel employees have been reminded to practise strict hygiene habits at all times.

'888888,0,GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak is hitting a peak in China this month and may be over by April, the government’s senior medical adviser said on Tuesday, in the latest assessment of an epidemic that has rattled the world.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Zhong Nanshan, an 83-year-old epidemiologist who won fame for combating the SARS epidemic in 2003, shed tears about the doctor Li Wenliang who died last week after being reprimanded for raising the alarm.\nBut Zhong was optimistic the new outbreak would soon slow, with the number of new cases already declining in some places.\nThe peak should come in middle or late February, followed by a plateau and decrease, Zhong said, basing the forecast on mathematical modelling, recent events and government action.\n“I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,” he said in a hospital run by Guangzhou Medical University, where 11 coronavirus patients were being treated.\nThough his comments may soothe some global anxiety over the coronavirus - which has killed more than 1,000 people and seen more than 40,000 cases, almost all in China - Zhong’s previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature.\n“We don’t know why it’s so contagious, so that’s a big problem,” added Zhong, who helped identify flaws in China’s emergency response systems during the 2002-03 SARS crisis.\nHe said there was a gradual reduction in new cases in the southern province of Guangdong where he is based, and also in Zhejiang and elsewhere. “So that’s good news for us.”\nWith China taking unprecedented measures to seal infected regions and limit transmission routes, Zhong applauded the government for locking down Wuhan, the city at the epicentre which he said lost control of the virus at an early stage.\n“The local government, local healthcare authority should have some responsibility on this,” he said.\n“Their work had not been done well.”\nThe virus is believed to have originated in early December in a Wuhan seafood market where wildlife was illegally sold.\nLocal authorities have also come under fire for their heavy-handed treatment of the late doctor Li, who was reprimanded by police in early January for “spreading rumours” about the disease before becoming its best-known fatality last Friday.\n“The majority of the people think he’s the hero of China,” Zhong said, wiping tears. “I’m so proud of him, he told people the truth, at the end of December, and then he passed away.”\nBehind him stood hundreds of other doctors all wanting to tell the truth and now being encouraged by the government to do so, he said. “We really need to listen,” he said.\nThe virus has now infected more than 40,000 people on the Chinese mainland and spread to at least 24 countries.\nZhong, who said the government’s unwillingness to share information prolonged the SARS crisis, said Beijing had done much better this time on issues like transparency and cooperating with the World Health Organization (WHO).\nBut more should be done, he said, including an end to wildlife trade, better international cooperation on hygiene technology, improved operation of disease control centres, and a global “sentry” system to warn of potential epidemics.\n“If we have better cooperation and coordination, we can find it earlier and figure out the human-to-human transmission earlier,” he said during the roughly 90-minute interview, adding that the outbreak would not be quite so serious if such a system was in place.\nZhong said uncertainties remained about how the coronavirus was infecting patients, if it can spread via faeces and whether so-called “superspreaders” were helping transmit the disease.\nSo far, China’s data shows the recovery rate to be quite low, with less than 10% of confirmed patients discharged, but Zhong said authorities were leaving nothing to chance, with many patients still quarantined in wards now reasonably healthy.\n“They didn’t know if they were going to re-infect or not... so that’s why the cure rate up to now is not that high.”\nWearing masks outside contagion zones was not always necessary, he said, and the United States’ and others’ entry ban on Chinese was an over-reaction. Furthermore, it appeared children were less vulnerable, he added.\nGlobal, apolitical cooperation was crucial, Zhong said.\n“I think maybe we should be going closer, I mean in particular our colleagues and scientists, and have more cooperation,” he said. “We’re just dealing with the disease - nothing to do with the political, nothing.”\n'
'888888,0,With the coronavirus outbreak declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), many companies around the world have asked their employees to work from home until the virus is contained.\nSome large firms and start-ups in India have now followed suit in line with the government\'s measure to limit the spread of the virus, as the number of confirmed cases in India jumped to over 70.\nIndia also recorded its first death from the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) on Thursday.\nCompanies such as Cognizant, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Uber, Ola, Swiggy, Paytm, Wipro and Tech Mahindra have offered employees the option to work from home.\nThere are many other Indian companies, especially startups, which have asked their respective employees to work from home.\nA Google office in Bengaluru has asked all employees to work from home tomorrow after a techie was tested positive for the virus. The tech firm has already asked all North American employees to work from home.\nSeveral industry bodies like NASSCOM have already requested the government to waive restrictions around work from home in light of the coronavirus outbreak which has spread to hundreds of countries around the globe.\nThough work from home could hurt operations flow at Indian firms, top management at corporate firms has instructed or recommended employees to work from home.\nOne way recommended by health experts in tackling the virus is avoiding large gatherings or social distancing.\nDelhi\'s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday also advocated social distancing as a measure as the government banned big events, conferences and social gatherings.\nSocial distancing as solution \nIt has worked for China, which finally declared on Thursday that the peak of coronavirus was over in the epicentre Hubei province and Wuhan city. The number of newly reported cases had dropped to 8 for the first time ever since the initial infections were recorded.\nAffected areas in China were kept under lockdown, causing severe disruptions to daily life. Several major factories and industries were shut and people were even asked to work from home.\nThough this caused economic damage to China and the global economy, the "social distancing" measures seem to have worked well for the country worst affected by the novel coronavirus.\nMajor technology companies including the likes of Apple are now looking to reopen all branded stores in China after a period of strict measures.\nItaly, which along with Iran is one of the worst affected due to coronavirus, is also following a similar strategy of social lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections. Many factories have been shut as a result of the lockdown.\nEven French President Emmanuel Macron urged employers to allow their staff to work from home, wherever possible.\nMeanwhile, with the number of cases rising in the UK, a leading researcher told everyone in the country, who can work from home, should avoid going to office.\nWilliam Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Dynamics at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston, told The Guardian that the rising number of infections in the UK could lead to local outbreaks in coming weeks and people should start working from home to prevent the possibility of contracting the coronavirus.\nIMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said in a recent blog post that "this health crisis will have a significant economic fallout" due to supply shocks and demand.\nIn short, the economic fallout of coronavirus is unavoidable and efforts should be towards keeping people/employees healthy. This would help affected countries bounce back smoothly, suggest economists.\nTherefore, both economists and health experts suggest that the primary goal in order to bring the global economy back on track is to keep people healthy and safe during the peak of the virus outbreak.\nIndia and its billion-plus\nThe risk of the virus spreading in India is much greater due to the sheer number of citizens. With its billion-plus population, India could find itself in a pool of worries if infections rise. Cases in India have spiked significantly over the last few days.\nSince the precautions to tackle coronavirus are limited, it could be difficult to prevent infections from rising in India, especially in offices that employ a large number of people.\nThe government has directed schools and colleges to be closed, but it would hardly matter if office-goers bring the virus home to their children.\nWhile many humorous takes on the subject have been posted by users on social media, the fact remains that children and other family members are not safe if the working individuals in their family have to face the risks.\nThough a large-scale work from home policy could trigger disruptions in operational flow, companies may follow the trend as the first objective should be to limit the spreading of coronavirus.\nFirms and organisations which have not announced work from home for employees yet have implemented several precautionary measures to prevent the virus from spreading.\nHowever, it should be noted that employees who have to report at work may face a higher chance of contracting the virus. They are exposed to public transport, food, and more people - something that most health experts have asked to avoid.\nOver 700 employees working at a private factory in Noida have been kept under watch after a person was tested positive.\nAt a time when the entire world is trying to fight an unknown virus, experts said each and every part of the society, including organisations and firms, should take all necessary steps to tackle the virus from spreading even at the cost of disruptions.\nAs the saying goes: prevention is better than cure.\n'

The city of 11 million people, where the virus first appeared last year, is under virtual lockdown.\nChinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence the flu-like virus is being brought under control but global health officials say it is still to early to predict how the epidemic will play out.\nThe head of a leading hospital in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to have succumbed to the disease, known as COVID-19.\nChinese state media reported that Hubei would adopt more forceful measures to find patients with fever to help contain the epidemic, on top of steps already taken to isolate the province.\nThe province will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan. 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications at both brick-and-mortar and online drug stores, Xinhua reported, citing a notice by the province’s epidemic control headquarters.\nThe World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies programme chief, Mike Ryan, said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday were monitored.\n“Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,” Ryan said.\nThe number of new cases in mainland China excluding Hubei has now fallen for 15 straight days. The number of new infections ex-Hubei totalled 56 on Feb. 18, down from a peak of 890 on Feb 3.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside of China is on a cruise ship in quarantine off Japan, where more than 540 out of 3,700 passengers and crew have tested positive.\nAround 500 passengers were set to disembark on Wednesday, although those sharing a room with people testing positive would have to stay on board longer, Japanese media and officials said.

'888888,0,(Reuters) - The spread of a new coronavirus in mainland China and to 27 countries and regions beyond is alarming health experts. Here is what we know - and do not know - about the virus:\nThe coronavirus family of viruses includes the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nMany of those with the new virus who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.\nCoronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and breathing difficulties.\nStatistics from China indicate that about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10% of infected individuals. The MERS outbreak in 2012 had a fatality rate of about 35%.\nScientists have labeled the new virus 2019-nCoV.\nThe virus can be transmitted via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.\nExperts have said it is more easily transmitted than the SARS virus. The incubation period is up to 14 days. People may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people frequently wash hands, cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.\n“We recommend the use of masks for people who have symptoms ... because the virus transmits through droplets,” says medical expert Sylvie Briand.\nBut they do not guarantee protection against infection.\n“For people who don’t have symptoms, the mask in fact is not useful,” Briand says.\nThe American Centers for Disease Control’s advice is that face masks are not required for the general public.\nThere is no vaccine\n.\nChinese scientists were able to identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and shared it publicly. Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a step toward creating a vaccine.\nDrugmakers around the globe expect to begin testing experimental vaccines on humans in about three months.\nAbout 99% of the more than 20,000 cases have been reported in mainland China. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in about 27 other countries and regions, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.\nAt least 490 people have died in China, most in and around the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, both following visits to Wuhan.\nSingapore confirmed four more coronavirus cases on Feb. 5 taking its tally to 28. Thailand has 25 cases.\nIt took the new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first1,000 people. It took SARS 130 days to infect 1,000 people. It took MERS 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.\nThe Chinese government has virtually locked down the central province of Hubei, home to 60 million people, and its capital Wuhan.\nChina is facing mounting isolation as airlines suspend flights to its cities.\nThe United States and Australia have banned entry to foreign nationals who have recently traveled to China.\nMany countries have evacuated their citizens from Hubei and are putting them in quarantine or isolation upon return.\nThe WHO has not recommended travel or trade curbs with China.\nIt is believed to have originated in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.

China responded to the goodwill gesture with gratitude.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said that India's acts demonstrate its friendship with China.\nAlthough India and China on earlier occasions have come to the rescue of their nationals in distress in respective countries, the evacuation of Indian nationals from Wuhan is unprecedented in recent history.\nThe message of the evacuation exercise is very clear: The two countries being neighbours, it is only prudent to learn to live with each other.\nThe bottom line is mutual sensitivity and concerns.\nHopefully, the covid-19 will pass sooner than later.\nThe two countries will have to work hard to execute and implement the slew of events lined up in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relations.\nIndia also reached out to the SAARC fraternity during this period of the virus outbreak.\nHe also said that India was assembling a rapid response eam of doctors and specialists, along with testing kits and other equipment, to be made available to member countries, if required.\nThe proposal has been fructified and has received immediate traction.\nIn response to Prime Minister Modi's appeal, both Bhutan and Nepal each have pledged $1 million to the emergency corpus.\nIndia in the meanwhile has received requests from member countries for assistance in the form of masks, shoe cover, gloves, disinfectants and other items.\nPrime Minister Modi also held a telephonic conversation with Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, which now holds the presidency of the G-20 and emphasised the need for coordinated efforts to address the global challenge arising out of the coronavirus outbreak.\nGoing beyond the perimeter of the region, India also took on board a number of major countries, besides the US to cooperate and coordinate efforts to fight covid-19.\nForeign Secretary Harsh Shringla joined a telephonic conference call initiated by US Deputy Secretary of State Steve Biegun.\nThe teleconference also included senior representatives from Australia, South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand and Japan.\nIt was decided that these countries would cooperate on vaccine development, challenges of stranded citizens, assistance to countries in need and to mitigate the impact of covid-19 on global economy.\nIndia's soft power diplomacy came into play during this cataclysm affecting the world as the pandemic defies barriers and borders and it projected Prime Minister Modi as a statesman of substance and stature.\n"
"888888,0,SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. \n While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. \n CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY \n There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. \n In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. \n SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. \n Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. \n The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. \n In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. \n Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. \n More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity. \n  \n The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. \n Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. \n LESSONS FROM SARS \n The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. \n The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. \n This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. \n Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. \n This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. \n Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. \n CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS \n A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing. \n  \n This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. \n During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. \n For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. \n Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. \n Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. \n Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. \n During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. \n This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. \n Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. \n Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms. \n  \n If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. \n Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. \n VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS \n Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” \n As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. \n All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. \n Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. \n That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Assistant Professor Jyoti Somani, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and President, Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. \n Editor's Note: A previous headline to this commentary referred to hot and dry climate.

We are also getting fully prepared for this because of such close proximity between Hong Kong and the mainland, and very hectic travel,” Yau told Reuters.\nDuring the Lunar New Year celebrations, tens of millions of Chinese travel domestically, starting from this week.\n“Policy is on high alert, making sure that we can contain and prevent the spreading of the disease.”\nThe virus, originating in Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.\nThere have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Hong Kong, although the Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed on Wednesday its first case of pneumonia linked to the coronavirus.\nYau also said the former British colony was well placed to address any cyclical and structural challenges, just days after Moody’s downgraded the financial hub, blaming the government for failing to deal with the sometimes violent protests.\nSpeaking about the city’s “one country, two systems” formula of governance, Yau said Hong Kong was holding on “steadfastly” to the system\n.\nBritain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy under the “one country, two systems” formula, including a free press and independent judiciary.\nMany protesters believe Beijing has been steadily encroaching on that promised autonomy, something that China denies.\n'
"888888,0,JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - As more countries record new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus, Indonesia's claim of being virus-free continues to raise doubts as questions persist over the effectiveness of monitoring and testing efforts of local health authorities. \n The country only allows one lab, run by the Health Ministry's Health Research and Development Agency (Balitbangkes), to test swab samples of suspected Covid-19 patients. \n As of Saturday (Feb 29), it had tested 143 samples taken from people who had shown symptoms or had travelled to infected countries. All were reportedly negative. \n However, the government did not test the 237 citizens and one American spouse of an Indonesian national who were evacuated from Wuhan and other cities in China after a 14-day quarantine in Natuna, Riau Islands. \n The government claimed they had already been declared virus-free when leaving China, so it was unnecessary for them to be tested again. \n Instead of being more vigorous and deploying more resources in conducting health monitoring and tests, the government later announced it would allocate Rp 72 billion (S$7.2 million) for promotional purposes - partly for so-called social media influencers - to attract foreign tourists to Indonesia and help revive the country's tourism, which has been battered by the outbreak. \n But this kind of blind optimism wins nobody's trust, especially from the international community. \n Several foreign nationals who transited in Indonesia have tested positive for Covid-19. They might have contracted the virus in Indonesia and it does not rule out the possibility that the country has become a vector of the disease. \n Saudi Arabia has banned Indonesian pilgrims from going on umrah (minor haj), even though Indonesia has not declared any confirmed cases of infection. \n A document circulating among foreign diplomats obtained by the Sydney Morning Herald pointed out that the inadequate transportation of specimens was among the concerns that led them to doubt Indonesia's virus-free status. \n Countries have escalated measures to mitigate the virus.

'888888,0,By Melati Mohd AriffThis is a round-up of COVID-19 related matters in Malaysia and globally from Feb 10 to 14.Update as at 5.30pm: Total number of patients who have recovered in Malaysia and Indonesia\'s first possible COVID-19 case.Kuala Lumpur (Bernama ) --\xa0The number of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia remains at 19 today at the time of writing since the first case was reported on Jan 25.Out of the 19 cases, six are Malaysians while the remaining 13 are Chinese citizens.Today,\xa0four more patients, all Chinese nationals,\xa0in Malaysia were reported to have\xa0recovered, bringing the total number of people who have recovered to seven.\xa0Today\'s cases comprised a 65-year-old woman, her daughter-in-law, 36, and two grandchildren aged 11 and two.\xa0\xa0The three patients who had recovered earlier, also Chinese nationals, were\xa0two men aged 63 and 40 and a four-year-old girl.Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad was earlier (on Feb 12) quoted as saying that the spread of the COVID-19 virus infection remained under control and that the country was in the early containment phase.Responding to a statement issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), he said Malaysia had stepped up its preparations earlier in the event of wider transmission of COVID-19.WHO regional director for the Western Pacific Dr Takeshi Kasai told all countries, including Malaysia, to prepare for the possibility of a wider transmission of the COVID-19 virus.He said the region was at a "critical juncture" following reports of COVID-19 positive cases with no link to China.Meanwhile, it was reported today that a 19-year-old student from Sifnana village, Tanimbar Islands, Maluku\xa0in Indonesia has been quarantined after showing symptoms of COVID-19.The student had reportedly visited Malaysia and will be quarantined for 14 days while awaiting the test results.COVID-19 was previously identified as the Wuhan virus or 2019-nCoV and it was first detected in the city of Wuhan in\xa0Hubei province, China, on Dec 31, 2019.WHO announced the official name of the virus (COVID-19) on Feb 11 at a news conference at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.\xa0COVID-19 is the acronym for coronavirus 2019 – CO stands corona, VI for virus and D for disease.WHO also announced that the first vaccine for COVID-19 could be available in 18 months and stressed that the disease should be seen as "public enemy number one".On Feb 11, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to form a joint working committee to address the COVID-19 outbreak more effectively and share information on public health, medication and research.Dr Dzulkefly said the committee would be led by his deputy Dr Lee Boon Chye and Dr Lee\'s counterpart from Singapore.\xa0ADVICE FOR THE PUBLICMeanwhile, the public has been advised not to shake hands but practice the \'Salaam Malaysia\' gesture when greeting people to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Dr Lee said the gesture – placing the right hand over the heart area of the chest – would prevent people from touching each other, thus reducing the possibility of contracting the virus.Despite the stern warning from the police and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission that action will be taken against those who spread fake news or rumours with regard to COVID-19, police have opened another investigation paper in relation to this matter, bringing the number of such cases to 23 so far.Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (Intelligence and Operations) deputy director Datuk Mohd Roze Shaari said the new investigation paper involved a case in Tumpat, Kelantan.So far three cases have been brought to court, one each in Kuala Lumpur, Terengganu and Sabah.\xa0GLOBAL STATISTICS\xa0According to the latest statistics taken from the Ministry of Health\'s website, the total number of COVID-19 cases\xa0worldwide currently stands at\xa064,267 covering\xa025 countries and the total number of deaths\xa01,489.\xa0\xa0Reuters reported yesterday that China\'s Hubei province recorded 242 deaths on Wednesday (Feb 12), so far the highest number of deaths reported in a single day. Hubei\'s Health Commission also reported 14,840 new\xa0COVID-19 positive cases on the same day.Apart from one death in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines that occurred last week, Japan announced one death yesterday. The Japan Times quoted Health Minister\xa0Katsunobu Kato as saying that the patient who died was a woman in her 80s who hailed\xa0from Kanagawa region in the southwest of Tokyo.Japan has 33 cases of domestic infection; however, some 218 people on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been docked at the port in Yokohama since early February,\xa0have also been tested positive for COVID-19.Besides China and Japan,\xa0others\xa0in the top 10 countries with the highest number of infections are Singapore\xa058 cases, Thailand 33, South Korea 28, Malaysia 19, Germany\xa016, Vietnam 16, Australia 15, United States 15 and France 11.\xa0Yesterday, AFP reported that several villages in Vietnam with about 10,000 people situated close to the nation\'s capital were placed under quarantine yesterday\xa0after six cases of COVID-19 were discovered there.On Feb 11, media reports from Wuhan stated that new research based on data gathered from more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients in China found that the incubation period for the virus was as long as 24 days rather than the previously believed 14 days.The study, carried out by about 36 researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools, found that less than half of the patients showed fever symptoms when they first saw a doctor.Head of the research team Dr Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemiologist who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, was quoted as saying that much is still unknown about COVID-19.Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and breathing difficulty. In more severe cases, the infection can lead to lung inflammation, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.\xa0COVID-19 BACKGROUNDAccording to the WHO website, its China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia that were detected in Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019.\xa0On Jan 7, the Chinese authorities confirmed that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from human to human.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV).A study of the virus\' genetic sequence suggested similarities to that seen in snakes and bats.China health officials identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source of the transmission of the coronavirus.Besides Malaysia, COVID-19 has spread to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, Germany, United States, France, Macau, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom,\xa0Canada, Italy, Russia, Spain, Finland, Cambodia, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Belgium.On Jan 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency. By then, it had spread to 18 countries and caused 170 deaths.The declaration was aimed at preventing or reducing transmissions across borders.With 1,489 deaths worldwide as of today, COVID-19 has overtaken SARS which caused 774 deaths in 2003.\xa0Translated by Rema NambiarBERNAMA\xa0\r\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\r\n\xa0'
'888888,0,Over 16,000 confirmed cases were reported in a single day in the United States on Thursday as the total number of COVID-19 patients soared to 85,088, the highest for any country, according to data compiled by Worldometer.\n\nThe United States surpassed China (81,285) and Italy (80,589) in terms of number of people infected with the novel coronavirus.\nAccording to Worldometers, the website that records confirmed cases of infection and deaths globally, the US by Thursday night had 85,088 individuals infected with coronavirus, of which 16,877 were added just in a single day.\nA week ago, the number of confirmed cases were 8,000.\nIt has dangerously surged 10 times in the span of a week.\nWith at least 263 deaths, the US also reported most number of fatalities due to the contagion on a single day on Thursday.\nAt least 1,290 Americans have died due to coronavirus so far.\nOver 2,000 coronavirus cases were reportedly in a serious condition.\nThe number of confirmed cases as well as the deaths due to COVID-19 are likely to increase substantially in the coming days.\nIn China, from where it all originated, 3,287 people have died due to coronavirus pandemic while Italy has recorded 8,215 such deaths.\nUS President Donald Trump attributed the spike in the confirmed cases of coronavirus to the large-scale testing of the deadly disease.\n"I think it\'s a tribute to our testing," he said, adding "no one knows what the numbers are in China".\n\nVice President Mike Pence said it is important for hospitals and labs testing the samples to report back to the Centre for Disease Control and Federal Emergency Management Agency so that the government has full visibility to provide the President with the best counsel.\nThe Abbott Laboratory, he said, submitted to Food and Drug Administration a national request for approval of a point-of-care test.\nThis would be the kind of test where one could go to a doctor and get the test done and have the results in no more than 15 minutes.\nAccording to Dr Deborah Brix, coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, 55 per cent of all new cases continue out of the New York -- New York Metro area.\nThis includes New Jersey as well, she said and expressed concern over the coronavirus spread.\n"At the same time, 19 of the 50 states that had early cases, but have persistently low level of cases and at this point have less than 200 cases," she said.\nIn an in interview with CNN, Dr Anthony Fauci, America\'s top infectious disease expert said it is difficult to tell where the pandemic will go and how long it will last in the US.\nThis is the relative percentage of asymptomatic infection -- and it "influences everything," he said.\nIt influences transmission, contact tracing, and the measures that the authorities need to take. That\'s why the most important thing to do now is to conduct widespread testing and collect more data, he asserted.\n\nHe called for ratcheting up the current level of contact tracing and testing. "We\'ve got to do it better than we are now".\nThe prestigious Johns Hopkins University, which is also recording all cases of coronavirus, reported 83,836 cases in the United States, ahead of China and Italy.\nDr Brix said so far the US has done 5,50,000 tests.\n"We are still running somewhere about 14 per cent overall. That means 86 per cent of the people with significant symptoms because remember you had to have a fever and symptoms to get tested at this point. So still 86 per cent are negative," she said.\nThese are really important facts for the American people, Dr Brix said.\nShe was critical of some of the modelling studies which had said that there would be 500,000 deaths in the UK and 2.2 million deaths in the US.\n"They have adjusted that number in the UK to 20,000. Half a million to 20,000. We are looking into this in great detail to understand that adjustment," she said.\n"When people start talking about 20 per cent of a population getting infected, it\'s very scary but we don\'t have data that matches that based on the experience," Dr Brix said.\nShe assured Americans that there is no shortage of essential medical supplies including ventilators and ICU beds.\n'
'888888,0,(Adds details of virus name)\nBy Stephanie Nebehay\nGENEVA, Feb 7 (Reuters) - The world is facing a chronic shortage of gowns, masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the fight against a spreading coronavirus epidemic, World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday.\nThe U.N. agency has been sending testing kits, masks, gloves, respirators and gowns to every region, Tedros told the WHO Executive Board in Geneva.\n“However the world is facing a chronic shortage of personnel protective equipment, as you might imagine.\n“This afternoon I will be speaking to the pandemic supply chain network to identify the bottlenecks and find solutions and push (for) fairness in distribution of equipment,” he said.\nAs of 6 a.m. Geneva time (0500 GMT) there were 31,211 confirmed coronavirus cases in China and 637 deaths, as well as 270 cases in 24 other countries with 1 death, Tedros said.\n“For the last two days there had been fewer reported infections in China, which is good news, but we caution against reading too much into that. The numbers could go up again,” he said.\nDuring its technical briefing for member states, there was discussion about naming the virus - which emerged in a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late December.\nWHO has already assigned an interim name of 2019-nCOV (novel coronavirus) acute respiratory disease.\n“We thought it very important that we provide an interim name so no location was associated with the name. I’m sure you have seen many media reports that are still calling this, using the name Wuhan or using China,” WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove told the board.\n“We wanted to ensure that there was no stigma associated with this virus, and so we’ve put out this interim name,” she said.\nDr\n. Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergency expert, said: “I think the bigger point here is to ensure that some of the actions, some of the reactions internationally, it is the responsibility of us all to ensure there is no stigma associated with this disease.\n“The unnecessary, unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable and it needs to stop. Governments have a responsibility to communicate with their populations on this,” Ryan told the board.\n'
'888888,0,At least "a hundred Portuguese" are being held in the Philippines, "distressed" and "desperate", without being able to return to Portugal, several members of the group told Lusa agency this Tuesday.\n"In this group [in Cebu] are over 40 Portuguese, but spread throughout the Philippines,"according to the last count, they were appreciably 120", because"there are many people who are trapped on islands", explained Emanuel Mosca.\n"There are desperate people, I have seen people cry and want everything to go back to the country," he added, at Cebu International Airport.\n"We were all on islands, and we thought it right, in case anyone could help us, that it would always be better to go to an international airport," he said, speaking on behalf of the group, which surrounded him, made up of people from Lamego, Coimbra, Lisbon and Lima Bridge.\n"There are even people who have spent practically all their money on flights, who have since been cancelled, and who no longer know, if they really have to stay here, how they will stand, how they will stand, because they have no answer from practically anyone," he added.\nThey were told five days ago that they had to leave the country. "In my particular case I have already spent almost a thousand euros on hotels and also on flights that were eventually cancelled", he said.\nThe group is arranging to stay in the same hotel. In order not to be scattered about each other, because we are already afraid, afraid of running out of money, afraid of being away from our country, we are afraid, then, if something happens, of not being treated well here because we are foreigners", he stressed.\n"They created a line of support from Portugal, to which many people had access and had no information or response from the authorities. (...) We have had a follow-up and thank you for this, a follow-up by the Portuguese Consul of Jakarta, who has been providing us with some information on a daily basis,"he stressed, to clarify that the diplomat"has been tireless in this regard, but (...) what he has done, perhaps because he does not have great powers, great means for Doing better, (...) was just providing us with information.\nIn other words, "solutions we have none so far", he summarized.\n"We no longer know anything, we are really distressed", concluded Emanuel Mosca.\nIn the Philippines, 142 and 12 are killed due to the outbreak of Covid-19. The country has adopted a series of restrictive measures since Sunday and for a month, in particular entry and exit to the capital, Manila, with several airlines cancelling flights.\nThe coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic infected about 170 thousand people, of whom 6.850 died.\nFrom infected people around the world, over 75 thousand have recovered from the disease.\nThe outbreak began in China in December and spread over 140 countries and territories, which led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic situation.\nAfter China, which records most cases, Europe became the center of the pandemic, with almost 60 thousand infected and at least 2.684 dead.\nDue to the advance of the pandemic, several countries have adopted exceptional measures, including the quarantine regime and the closure of borders.'
'888888,0,Struck down by coronavirus at the age of 83, the long life of Alfredo Visioli ended with a short ceremony at a graveyard near Cremona, his hometown in northern Italy.  \n "They buried him like that, without a funeral, without his loved ones, with just a blessing from the priest," said his granddaughter Marta Manfredi who couldn\'t attend. Like most of the old man\'s family - like most of Italy - she was confined to her home.  \n "When all this is over," she vows, "we will give him a real funeral."  \n Everywhere the coronavirus has struck, regardless of culture or religion, ancient rituals to honour the dead and comfort the bereaved have been cut short or abandoned for fear of spreading it further.  \n The virus, which has killed nearly 9,000 people worldwide, is reshaping many aspects of death, from the practicalities of handling infected bodies to meeting the spiritual and emotional needs of those left behind.  \n In Ireland, the health authority is advising mortuary workers to put face masks on dead bodies to reduce even the minor risk of infection. In Italy, a funeral company is using video links to allow quarantined families to watch a priest bless the deceased. And in South Korea, fear of the virus has caused such a drop in the number of mourners that funeral caterers are struggling for business.  \n There is little time for ceremony in hard-hit cities such as Bergamo, northeast of Milan, where the mortuaries are full and the crematorium is working around the clock, said Giacomo Angeloni, a local official in charge of cemeteries.  \n Bergamo, home to about 120,000 people, has been dealing with 5-6 times the number of dead it would in normal times, he said.  \n Italy has now reported nearly 3,000 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus - the highest outside China where the virus first emerged. The Italian army sent 50 troops and 15 trucks to Bergamo on Wednesday to take bodies to less overwhelmed provinces.  \n A ban on gatherings has shattered the vital rituals that help us grieve, said Andy Langford, the chief operating officer of Cruse Bereavement Care, a British charity providing free care and counselling to those in grief.  \n "Funerals allow a community to come together, express emotion, talk about that person and formally say goodbye," he said.  \n "When you feel you have no control over how you can grieve, and over how you can experience those last moments with someone, that can complicate how you grieve and make you feel worse," he said.  \n  \n EXTRA STAFF  \n In Iran as in northern Italy, hospital and funeral workers are overwhelmed with bodies, as the virus has torn across the country, killing 1,284 people and infecting thousands, according to state TV.  \n The authorities have hired new people to dig graves, said a manager at Tehran\'s Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. "We work day and night," he said. "I have never seen such a sad situation. There are no funerals."  \n Most corpses arrive by truck and are buried without the ritual washing that Islam dictates, he said.  \n Some Iranians suspect that the official haste to bury them has more to do with obscuring the spiralling death toll than halting the spread of the virus.  \n Deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded as heart attacks or lung infections, a hospital worker in Kashan, a city about a three-hour drive from Tehran, told Reuters.  \n "The officials are lying about the death toll," the worker said. "I have seen dozens of corpses in the past few days, but they have told us not to talk about it." Two nurses at Iranian hospitals also told Reuters they thought the death toll was higher than the official tally.  \n Iranian authorities have rejected allegations of a cover-up, and President Hassan Rouhani, in a televised speech on Mar. 18, said his government had been "honest and straightforward with the nation."  \n  \n INFECTION RISK  \n In several countries, clusters of infection have followed funerals. In South Korea, where more than 90 people have died, the government has urged the families of COVID-19 victims to cremate their loved ones first, and hold the funeral later.  \n Korean funerals usually take place in hospitals, and involve three days of prayers and feasting. Most of the country\'s early cases were linked to a church in Daegu city and a hospital in a nearby county. In February, several members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus attended a funeral at the hospital for the brother of the church\'s founder.  \n Since the outbreak, the number of mourners at funerals has plunged by 90%, regardless of whether the deceased had the virus, said Choi Min-ho, secretary general of the Korea Funeral Association.  \n "The culture of funerals has changed significantly," he said. "A handful of mourners quickly offer condolences and leave the place without dining together out of infection worries."  \n Condolence money, traditionally handed over in cash, is now sent via bank transfer, he added.  \n Authorities in Wuhan, the epicentre of China\'s outbreak and location of the majority of its deaths, quickly identified the funeral business as a potential source of transmission.  \n The local civil affairs bureau in late January ordered all funerals for confirmed COVID-19 victims to be handled at a single funeral home in the city\'s Hankou district. Mourning ceremonies, usually boisterous social events in China, were curtailed along with all other public gatherings.  \n Those restrictions are still in place, even though the number of new cases has dwindled in recent weeks. Bereaved families are not even allowed to see the bodies of their loved ones, a worker at the funeral home told Reuters.  \n In China, the ashes of the deceased tend to be kept in funeral homes until they are taken to a family plot on public holidays such as the Tomb Sweeping Festival in April. That\'s also cancelled this year.  \n  \n "DEATH MANAGEMENT"  \n In Spain, too, a large cluster of cases has been traced to a funeral in the northern town of Vitoria in late February. At least 60 people who attended tested positive after the event, said local media reports.  \n With over 600 deaths, Spain is the second-worst hit country in Europe after Italy, and most people are now confined to their homes. Referring to these restrictions, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called coronavirus a "cruel" disease that paralyses the human need to socialize.  \n In Ireland, up to 100 guests are still allowed at all funerals - for now. But most families are opting for small private ceremonies and encouraging others to express their condolences online through websites such as RIP.ie, where death notices and funeral invitations are usually posted.  \n Open casket funerals are out for any victim of coronavirus, and "the family should be advised not to kiss the deceased," according to new guidelines from Ireland\'s Health and Safety Executive to its funeral directors.  \n The risk of catching coronavirus from a dead body is slim, public health officials say, but some countries are recommending extra measures.  \n Israel has reported no coronavirus deaths, but its health ministry says the deceased should be double-wrapped in impermeable plastic. Ritual washing and rites will be performed in full protective gear and the corpse re-wrapped in plastic for burial. Normally Israel\'s Jewish dead are laid to rest in a cloth smock and shroud.  \n Ireland\'s guidelines advise workers in funeral parlours to put face masks on dead bodies before moving them, in case they "expel a very small amount of air and viral droplets from the lungs" and infect the living.  \n In Britain, where the pandemic is still gathering pace, there is widespread anxiety about the likely death toll.  \n Britain has been slower in implementing the strict measures seen elsewhere in Europe, and expert estimates of how many will die from COVID-19 have ranged wildly from the tens to the hundreds of thousands.  \n An emergency bill to tackle the virus, which has killed 104 people in Britain, includes a number of measures the government says will "streamline the death management process." The measures include allowing funeral directors to register a death on behalf of a self-isolating family.  \n Deborah Smith, a spokesperson for the National Association of Funeral Directors, said the bill will help the profession "preserve the dignity of those who die and care for their bereaved families with compassion - even if they are not able to have the kind of funeral they would have wanted."  \n Smith would not be drawn on the expected numbers, but said "funeral directors are preparing for a variety of scenarios."  \n  \n "NOT ALONE"  \n One scenario is already playing out in Wuhan.  \n Last month, a worker at the funeral home in Hankou district, identifying himself only as Huang, wrote an essay that was circulated on social media. He said funeral workers were as overwhelmed as the city\'s medics but had received less recognition.  \n He said staff had worked without a break since the start of the epidemic. "Some of our employees don\'t even drink water because they need to go to the toilet and it\'s difficult to take off the protective clothing," he wrote.  \n Half a world away, in the virus-stricken Italian town of Bergamo, funeral workers wage a near-identical struggle.  \n "It\'s like being in a war with an invisible enemy," said Roberta Caprini, a partner in Centro Funerario Bergamasco, a funeral service in Bergamo. "We\'ve been working without interruption for two weeks and sleeping 3-4 hours a night when we manage it. Everyone in our area, us included, has lost someone or have someone sick in their home."  \n Bergamo\'s Church of All Saints has become a makeshift mortuary, its pews pushed aside to accommodate the dead. Caprini said she had counted at least 60 coffins when she visited on Tuesday.  \n She spoke of the "real torture" felt by families who watched sick relatives taken away to hospital and never saw them again. Her company has arranged video links to burials, to allow families to watch the priest bless the deceased.  \n Sometimes, she said, they drive the hearses past the bereaved family\'s home, so mourners "can at least come down at the moment and offer a quick prayer."

'888888,0,Geneva, 2 February. / Cole. Tass Constantine pritzkov When the coronavirus 2019 ncov outbreak of respiratory diseases in China, if there are symptoms of the disease, it will be more frequently transmitted from people to people; In the absence of infection, infection is rare. World Health Organization (who) Geneva Newsletter)\n"According to the current data, the main factor of infection is the occurrence of symptoms." In the absence of disease performance, the spread of disease is likely not to be the primary driver. "\n"The world organization points out that it understands that 2019-ncov may be transferred before the infected person has symptoms." However, the infection is rare, and in the case of sneezing and coughing, the virus is more likely to spread to people with symptoms.\nAsymptomatic people rarely infect other coronaviruses. "Like the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome."\nAbout\nAt the end of December 2019, Chinese authorities recorded an outbreak of respiratory diseases caused by coronavirus 2019 ncov in Wuhan. In addition to China, 23 countries, including Russia, have found the disease. Who recognizes the outbreak of international emergencies. So far, the total number of people infected by 2019 ncov in China has exceeded 14000, and more than 300 people have died.\n\xa0\n'
'888888,0,The pandemic wave has begun. In the coming weeks, thousands more people will also be infected in Germany with the new Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2. Even if measures such as the ban on public events and behavioural changes work and succeed in delaying the climax of the outbreak: there will be more deaths from the virus. It is now a question of protecting all those who are particularly at risk: older people in particular, but also those of all ages who have chronic diseases, whose immune system is weakened and who now more than ever need our support. And anyone can help.\nIt cannot be repeated often enough: the older the people, the more likely an infection with Sars-CoV-2 also ends deadly. The first small studies suggested this in January. Now this finding is becoming more and more forceful. Finally, a group of experts from the World Health Organization, WHO, visited China for nine days and evaluated the data from nearly 56.000 infected patients treated in Chinese hospitals (PDF: Joint Mission Report Covid-19, 2020). According to these data, about 22-percent of the over 80-year-old infected died of Covid-19. That\'s more than any fifth.\nComparison: Overall, the mortality rate, i.e. the proportion of people who died from the infection, was almost four per cent in this study. In fact, it is still likely to be significantly lower, as many infections are so mild that those affected did not have to be treated in hospital or even noticed because they did not go to medical treatment.\nIn another major study with almost 45.000 Chinese patients, about 15 percent of patients who were at least 80-year-old died (CDC Weekly: CPERE Novel, 2020Yeah. Among the 70- to 79-year-olds, every twelfth, i.e. eight percent, of the disease, in the 60- to 69-year-olds it was 3.6 percent. This shows that from fifty to sixty years the risk of serious illness increases significantly. Without specific therapy and a vaccine, these people need a place in an intensive care unit, a respirator and a circulatory stabilizer. And these places are in danger of becoming scarce.\nOf course, there can also be mild courses of Covid-19 disease for people of high age. But they are more unlikely because, over the years, the body\'s defenses are less effective, researchers speak of immunity censorship." For older people, it can happen that their body reacts late to the virus, the pathogen can spread more than for younger ones,"says virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine. This could in many cases even cause the immune system to overreact later and attack not only pathogens, but also own body cells." Such a reaction is one of the reasons why many old people with Covid-19 are doing so badly."\nBut even basic diseases can cause the virus to settle in the body and overcome its defenses. And this applies in principle to people of all ages who have mainly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or high blood pressure. This increases the risk of a serious Covid-19 infection, as researchers from China write in The Lancet magazine (Zhou et al., 2020)." Pre-illness reduces the performance of the body. The immune system has a harder time resisting the pathogens,"says Schmidt-Chanasit. This applies to sick people regardless of their age. But older people are particularly affected because they are more often not only suffering from a pre-existing disease, but severaYeah.\nThe Robert Koch Institut e also identifies people with chronic liver and lung disease, people suffering from cancer or immunodeficiency, and smokers. Covid-19 is a lung disease, so anything that affects or directly damages the airways can become a problem. These include cigarettes, of course, but sometimes also evaporators. Smoking could at least be a cause of men dying of the infection more often than women in China. Because there smoking is more a man\'s business. If this assumption is confirmed, further data must be provided.\nIn Italy, which is particularly hard hit by Sars-CoV-2, the age of more than three quarters of the reported patients is over fifty years, approximately 40 percent older than 70. This could be one of the reasons why many people with Sars-CoV-2 are dying there at the moment. More than 1.000 deaths are currently reported. We also know that the intensive care centres of hospitals in Lombardy are currently overloaded. And that, although the clinics in the region around Milan are among the best organized in the country, as Italy\'s most famous virologist Roberto Burioni explains in an interview with ZEIT ONLINE. "If the epidemic now spreads to other, structurally weaker regions, everything could get even worse," says Burioni.\nIn such a situation, more people can die who would survive under normal circumstances (The Lancet: Ji et al., 2020). For example, if patients with severe heart disease or kidney problems no longer have intensive beds available and therefore do not receive important therapies or are delayed. According to the German hospital company, such beds are located around 28.000 in Germany, and in winter, despite flu medication, antibiotics and vaccinations, they are often occupied by patients with influenza or bacterial infections" Fortunately, Germany is still far from a situation like in Italy,"says Clemens Wendtner, chief physician at the Munich clinic Schwabing. The most important thing now is to slow down the outbreak in such a way that as few Corona patients as possible need to be medically treated and ventilated at once.\nThe only way to do this is now recommended by the Federal Government and the Chancellor: to reduce social contacts wherever possible. Scientists and politicians have been promoting this social distance for weeks. Because it remains important: as few people as possible should be infected with Sars-CoV-2 to buy time at the moment. Days and weeks that can help relieve clinics, nurses and doctors. It is only when everyone avoids contact that the likelihood decreases that, above all, undetected infected people with mild symptoms infect all those who may be severely ill with Covid-19.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has compiled advice on how to protect themselves from the new Coronavirus infection (WHO: Situation Report -51). Here are the most important summaries:\nIf this does not happen, it could be difficult: "More viruses will then be carried in hospitals, personnel, which is already scarce anyway, and other patients will get infected and chaotic conditions will arise," says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit. According to the Hamburg virologist, such situations in which hospital operations are disrupted would also harm patients who have nothing to do with the Coronavirus.\nA healthy 26-year-old student can also catch the new Coronavirus. The infection can be severe for her, and it is not excluded that she will die of the new Covid-19 pneumonia. But it\'s not likelYeah. Because most young people have a mild Sars-CoV-2 infection. This means that a disease can be cured at home, perhaps with some fever and cough or similar symptoms. Of the nearly 45.000 infected from the second major study from China, only one person is listed who was between ten and 19 years old and died, among the patients between 20 and 29 years there were seven.\nThis is why young adults, children and pregnant women play the role of carriers in the current outbreak of Sars-CoV-2. They bring the virus to the elderly and the sick, for example during a family reunion on a Sunday, at a gun party, in a crowded theatre or when Grandma and Grandpa watch the children for a few hours in the afternoon.\nFor most, the symptoms of Covid-19 can seem so harmless that under normal circumstances they are unlikely to be aware that they are a danger to others: about 88 percent of hospital patients from the WHO study had a fever, about two thirds dry cough. A little less common were symptoms such as headaches, blocked nose or even rare diarrhoea. The virus became really dangerous, less than a fifth of the infected. Severe respiratory distress experienced almost fourteen percent and about six percent of cases were critical. That means patients had to be ventilated artificially.\nThe situation is similar in Germany, where the Robert Koch Institute published more detailed medical data on 737, which has now published more than 2.000 cases. Only twelve of them, i.e. 1.6 percent, were diagnosed with pneumonia. Most infected people suffered from coughing, fever or snoring (PDF: daily RKI status report from 11. March 2020).\nThere is also good news: children are relatively rarely affected by Covid-19, although they may be as infected as adultsYeah. This at least suggests a study, published without scientific advice, in which researchers have analysed symptoms and disease progressions of around 400 infected and their relatives (medRxiv: Bi et al., 2020). It showed that children were almost as often infected by a sick family member as the elderly. And that, although the age of most reported Covid-19 infected is significantly higher, between 30 and 69 years. Only 2,4 percent of the subjects studied in the WHO survey were 18-year-old or younger.\n"The immune system of children reacts slightly differently from that of adults," says the virologist Schmidt-Chanasit. The fact that illnesses in adults were significantly more severe is known, for example, from the wind spikes. What is the reason for this in the case of Sars-CoV-2, there are not yet sufficient data, only conjectures: "For example, the connecting points that the virus uses to invade the human cell may be less highly trained than in the elderly." Virus es may therefore be more difficult to enter the cells, to do damage.\nMany children who were examined in the WHO survey had such mild symptoms that their infection was only detected when someone from the family was sick and then routinely tested all the people around them." Children are transmitters of the virus, even though they are hardly noticeable in the statistics,"says Wendtner. He\'s already treated several Covid-19 patients. Including a family where a 12-year-old child has most likely infected its family members." In this case, too, the child had only mild symptoms,"says Wendtner. There was therefore a risk that children, although rarely observed to date, would bring the virus from kindergarten or school into the family.\nAnother group that normally needs special protection from other agents are pregnanYeah. For many infectious diseases they are considered a risk group because their immune system is more susceptible to infections. For this reason they are specifically advised to be vaccinated against the flu. But what else makes it particularly vulnerable could be an advantage in the case of the new Coronavirus." In pregnancy, a woman\'s body is virtually completely reprogrammed,"says Schmidt-Chanasit."The body of a woman The hormone levels are different, the immune system reacts differently."This may play a role in why, according to previous findings, pregnant women are often less affected by Covid-19 than by other infections. A study in nine Covid-19 pregnant women also suggested that the virus is unlikely to be passed on to their children, not in adults in the womb or via breast milk (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020)'

'888888,0,HAKONE - A Japanese confectionery shop in the popular hot spring town of Hakone has incurred the wrath of the Chinese for putting up a sign containing offensive content to ban Chinese tourists amid a global virus outbreak originating from China. \n The owner of the shop in an onsen resort in the popular Yumoto district in the Kanagawa prefecture told reporters he had put up the sign last week on Jan 17, one day after Japan announced its first case of infection of the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, in Kanagawa. \n "Ill-mannered Chinese tourists have caused trouble in my store," the man, who was not identified, was quoted as saying by the Asahi Shimbun news site. \n "I want to protect myself against the coronavirus.

'888888,0,RIYADH (Reuters) - Finance chiefs of the world’s top 20 economies vowed to monitor the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global growth and act if needed, as they said loose monetary policy and easing trade tensions would prompt a pick-up in 2020 and 2021.\nThe Group of 20 (G20) finance ministers and central bank heads faced a sober presentation by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which predicted the epidemic would shave 0.1 percentage points off global growth.\n“We will enhance global risk monitoring, including of the recent outbreak of COVID-19. We stand ready to take further action to address these risks,” the statement from the financial leaders said, using the medical acronym for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n“Global growth is expected to pick up modestly in 2020 and 2021,” they predicted. “The recovery is supported by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions and some signs of easing trade tensions.”\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said central bankers would look at options to respond to the epidemic if needed, while Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was ready to ease policy if necessary.\nChina was represented at the G20 meeting by its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, as senior officials stayed away due to the growing crisis over the virus.\nChinese state television quoted China’s President Xi Jinping as saying on Sunday Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow on the economy from the outbreak.\n“The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,” Xi said, though he added the effects would be short-term and controllable.\nSaudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told a news conference at the meeting: “We have discussed the outbreak of coronavirus in China and other countries and all the G20 countries agreed collectively on being ready to intervene with necessary policies.”\nThe epidemic, which originated in China, has since spread to nearly 30 countries and territories.\nSouth Korea raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level on Sunday but the European Union saw “no need to panic” over an outbreak in Italy.\n“In our current baseline scenario, announced policies are implemented and China’s economy would return to normal in the second quarter,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Saturday.\n“As a result, the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived.”\n“But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,” she added.\nThe ministers and central bankers also encouraged further work by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on global rules to tax digital giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook.\nIntergovernmental group the OECD is to prepare technical assumptions by July that would allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.\nThe group’s efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, including a proposed “safe harbor” regime which critics say would let multinationals choose whether to abide by the new set of rules or stick to existing regulations.\n“I told my counterparts that Japan is very concerned about the ‘safe harbor’ proposal,” Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters, joining a chorus of criticism by France and other nations over the U.S. proposal.\n“It would extremely diminish the regulatory effect of what we’re trying to do. That is a view expressed by various countries,” he said.\nMnuchin warned, however, that he opposed discriminatory taxes on digital services, the providers of which are mostly from the United States.\nHe said Washington would respond with investigations and potential retaliatory tariffs if countries decided to go it alone, outside the OECD deal.\nA final agreement on the global rules is to be ready by the end of this year to avoid a proliferation of different digital tax regimes all over the world.\n'

Many of these Brazilians are still in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease was discovered, others are in other cities of Hubei province and spread throughout various regions of China.\nAccording to the video, no Brazilian in that Asian country has so far shown symptoms or even any suspicion, no matter how slight, of having the coronavirus, dropping one of the allegations in order to refuse to rescue them, that to help a few dozen people, it would put millions at risk of others. Participants in the message also claim that they agree to quarantine in any other country outside China and Brazil, disarming another excuse for Bolsonaro, that Brazil does not have a specific law to quarantine people.\nFriday, after being criticized for not saying anything about the world crisis of the coronavirus and the calls of the Brazilians, Bolsonaro called the press\nYeah. In a series of hectic arguments, he stated that he could not send a plane to China without first the Supreme Court and Congress authorizing this expense, which was estimated at approximately 500 thousand dollars, so that it would not be used to try and take him out of office by accusing him of misuse of public money.\n'

'888888,0,Rumours on social media about the spread of coronavirus through birds have beaten down poultry prices, which have declined 10 per cent in the past two days owing to a sudden plunge in its demand in the country.\nBroiler chicken per kg is now being sold to consumers at Rs 65 in Pune and Rs 72 in Delhi as against Rs 73 and Rs 80 a kg, respectively, last week.\nSimilarly, egg prices have declined and are trading at Rs 3.75 per piece.\nSince the epidemic broke out in a few cities in China and a couple of cases were spotted in India as well, there were rumours that birds were the vector.\nNormally mammals are possible origin of this virus, which spills over into humans.\nCoronavirus is feared to have originated from bats in China.\n“Poultry demand has fallen by 10-15 per cent in the past two days.\n"Rumours surrounding the spread of coronavirus through animals and chicken could be a reason.\n"Prices of broiler chicken have declined by 10 per cent across all categories,” said Balram Yadav, managing director, Godrej Agrovet.\nHe added that coronavirus was different from avian influenza (H5N1), for which there was not even the remotest possibility of spreading to birds.\nMeanwhile, poultry farmers are facing squeezed profit margins between high-feed and low-broiler and egg prices.\nThe benchmark broiler chicken continues to trade below the estimated cost of its production of Rs 80 a kg for a sustained period of over a year now.\nMany farmers in major producing states like Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are protesting intermittently, seeking the government’s support on minimum support price and feed at a discounted price.\nBut, there has been no favourable response yet.\nWhile small farmers have stopped farming and are seeking other means of livelihood, large companies with deep pockets continue to incur losses in poultry farming.\n“Poultry demand is very week due to a lean season\n.\n"Normally, the six weeks between February 1 and March 15, demand for poultry products remains seasonally down due primarily to a slowdown in consumption during school examination period.\n"Rumours of coronavirus worsened poultry demand.\n"We hope, poultry prices to decline further till demand resumes possibly by March-end,” said K G Anand, general manager, Venkatashwara Hatcheries, the producer of Venky’s brand raw and ready-to-eat chicken products.\nMeanwhile, feed prices have jumped significantly over the last one year.\nBoth maize, bajra and oilmeal prices have gone up by up to 60 per cent since January 2019 to make survival difficult in poultry farming.\n'
"888888,0,SINGAPORE — Although postgraduate student Kimberley is serving out her 14-day stay-home notice confined in a hotel room and away from her family, her mother has ensured that she will not miss the familiarity of home. \n The 23-year-old, who is doing a master’s degree course on affective disorders at a British university and who wanted to be known only by her first name, said that her mother will try to deliver both lunch and dinner on “most days” to her. She has so far received her favourite bacon bone curry, among others, and even a yoga mat to help her stay active.\xa0 \n “She’s honestly the best,” Kimberley said of her mother, who leaves the items by the door of the Fraser Suites service apartment before running away. \n Kimberley said: “She’s very fast. By the time we get to the door, she’s not even on the floor anymore.” \n The postgraduate student returned to Singapore from the United Kingdom with her 24-year-old brother and her 25-year-old boyfriend on Tuesday evening, and they are now staying together in the same service apartment.\xa0 \n The trio are just one group of returning students out of many who are making their way back\xa0after the Singapore Government asked them to return home on March 17 due to the Covid-19 crisis.\xa0 \n CHANGING TRACKS \n The hotel industry here has been in a slump due to the lack of tourists caused by the global crisis. \n On Thursday, a message by President Halimah Yacob was read out in Parliament where she noted that Singapore’s hotel occupancy rate is at just 20 per cent presently. \n Now, hotels are gearing up to change tracks by taking in guests such as Kimberley who must serve their mandatory stay-home notice. \n Those who are served the notice cannot leave their place of stay or residence during the period, which begins from the time they land in Singapore. \n Some hoteliers told TODAY that being able to take in guests serving their stay-home notice has been an unexpected lifeline for them, given the gradual decline in tourist arrivals. \n Mr Adrian Siow is manager for Rest Bugis Hotel and Hotel 1888 Collection in Chinatown. Both properties are offering their rooms at a lower fixed rate for such individuals. \n He noted a “small surge” in demand as well after Malaysia’s lockdown recently, with Malaysian workers needing accommodation after they chose to stay and work here. \n However, Mr Siow said that their stay will not be indefinite and the industry is “struggling right now”. \n Since February, tourists who had visited mainland China have been barred from entering Singapore, in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This travel ban was extended to all other tourists on March 22. \n MINIMISING RISK BETWEEN TWO GROUPS \n Elsewhere, to boost occupancy rates, some branded hotels have begun offering staycation deals for residents who have had to cancel overseas holiday plans, while at the same time offering their rooms for those serving stay-home notices. \n Several of these properties are on the Singapore Global Network’s list of hotels for people who need to serve out their notice. \n They declined or did not respond to TODAY’s queries about what precautions they were putting in place to keep all guests and staff members safe from the risk of infection. \n However, when this reporter posed as a potential guest at three hotels, they gave assurances that they have a system in place to minimise or even eliminate contact between those serving their stay-home notice and guests just looking for a quick getaway.\xa0 \n In all instances, they said that the guests on stay-home notice are not allowed to leave their rooms at all times until the 14-day period is over. \n This applies for Mr Siow’s establishment as well. \n Mr Siow said that regardless of which hotel such guests are staying, housekeeping staff members are not allowed to enter the room during the notice period. A “deep-cleaning” process will be carried out once they leave, he said.\xa0 \n  Guests on stay-home notice who have checked into\xa0Grand Park Orchard are provided with a greater quantity of toiletries. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n Employees at both JW Marriott Hotel and Grand Hyatt Singapore also said that they have designated certain floors just for individuals on stay-home notice when this reporter asked as a guest.\xa0 \n At the Mandarin Orchard hotel, an employee said that it has dedicated one of its two towers just for this purpose. \n When asked what the chances were of a guest on stay-home notice checking in at the same time as a regular guest, the employee said that the chances are low because there are separate check-in counters for both categories of guests. \n All three hotels also said that they have stepped up cleaning frequency within their premises. \n Grand Hyatt, which was the among the first hotels here to receive the SG Clean certification, “frequently cleans up and wipes down high touch points” as well, its employee stressed.\xa0 \n To obtain the certification by the National Environment Agency, firms must meet a checklist of seven requirements. This includes the appointment of an SG Clean manager to oversee the hotel’s practices, putting in place processes to monitor the health of employees, and ensuring frequent disinfection of common facilities. \n DEDICATED HOTELS FOR RETURNING STUDENTS \n Aside from Grand Hyatt, Village Hotel Sentosa and Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa have also obtained this certification. These three hotels have all been linked to Covid-19 cases before. \n Village Hotel Sentosa and Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa will join a list of government-designated hotels for returning students from the United States and the UK.\xa0 \n The Ministry of Health said that from March 26, Singapore students returning from the US and UK have to serve their stay-home notice at facilities such as the hotels on the list that have agreed to dedicate their entire premises just for this purpose. \n The ministry said that it will arrange for the students to be taken directly from the airport to the hotels and the returnees will have their own room and toilet, and have all their meals provided. \n All these arrangements will be provided for free. \n  Guests serving their stay-home notice\xa0at Grand Park Orchard receive meals prepared by the hotel. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n The full list of government-designated hotels has not been made public, but TODAY understands that it also includes Village Hotel Albert Court, The Elizabeth Hotel and Grand Park Orchard. \n Mr Arthur Kiong, chief executive officer of Far East Hospitality — which manages the Village Hotel chains and The Elizabeth Hotel — said that as a homegrown company, he felt that it was a “national duty” to support government initiatives and help Singaporeans and residents get through this Covid-19 storm. \n This was a sentiment shared by Ms Tan Shin Hui, executive director of Park Hotel Group, which manages Grand Park Orchard, located opposite Paragon mall.\xa0 \n Both Mr Kiong and Ms Tan said that their designated hotels have several precautions in place to prepare for the arrival of these returning students.\xa0 \n For instance, from now till May 31, only guests serving their stay-home notice can access the designated hotels under Far East Hospitality. No other guests will be accepted.\xa0 \n Over at Grand Park Orchard, Ms Tan said that it has “taken extra precautionary measures” such as providing clear segregation of entry for individuals serving the notice and for employees or the public.\xa0 \n  An alternative entrance for guests who are serving their\xa0stay-home notice\xa0at Grand Park Orchard. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n For both hotel groups, they have also minimised the need for their older staff members or those with pre-existing health conditions to tend to guests who are serving stay-home notice.\xa0 \n Employees who need to deliver food or other items will leave them by the door without meeting the guest. \n Mr Kiong of Far East Hospitality said that upon these guests’ departure, the hotels will work closely with a government-appointed vendor to clean and sanitise the rooms, which includes the use of hospital-grade disinfectant. \n These precautions aside, Mr Kiong said that he understands the frustration and boredom that comes from being cooped up in an enclosed space for a long period of time.\xa0 \n “To help ease cabin fever, our staff members have been trained and will be deployed as an ‘e-buddy’ to check in on all our guests daily via phone to provide that human connection.” \n Such a service would have come in handy for Mr Clarence Tan, who is staying over at Grand Park Orchard. \n The 25-year-old, who is doing his master’s in finance in the UK, returned to Singapore on March 23 and had to serve out his stay-home notice. \n While he appreciates the city view from his room, he is growing tired of it. “There's (also) only so much you can watch and read before it gets boring,” Mr Tan said, adding that he has now resorted to doing home workouts in his room. \n Once his 14-days are up, he is looking forward to eating hawker food such as Hokkien mee, mee siam and kway chup. “Provided the stalls are still open.” \n "

'888888,0,The coronavirus is "the worst enemy imaginable" and represents a bigger global threat than terrorism, alerting the World Health Organisation (WHO). Urging the world to "wake up" and be as aggressive as possible in the fight against the outbreak, the UN health agency this Tuesday named the coronavirus COVID-19.\n"CO" refers to the corona, "VI" to the virus, "D" to the "disease" and "19" to the year in which it emerged. The WHO ensured that the name would not make any reference to a geographical location, animal location or group of people. According to the Director-General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, "having a name is important to prevent the use of other names that may be inaccurate or stigmatising".\nChina\'s health authorities expressed hopes that the outbreak would end in April, but Ghebreyesus is far less optimistic. Warning that the first vaccine for COVID-19 will only be ready within a year and a half, the Director General of the WHO stressed: "A virus is more powerful in creating political, social and economic turmoil than any terrorist attack."\n"We are only as strong as our weakest link, and if this virus reaches weaker health systems, it will cause damage... The outbreaks can provoke political, social and economic upheavals affecting all areas of society,"he added, at a press conference.\nThe Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Program, Michael Ryan, said this Tuesday in Geneva, Switzerland, that COVID-19 has the potential to spread faster than Ebola viruses or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Over the weekend, the new coronavirus exceeded the death toll of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2003.\nThe Chinese National Health Commission has updated the number of deaths for 1.113 and for 44.653 the number of cases confirmed in mainland ChinYeah. Overall, there are two more deaths to be recorded (one in the Philippines and one in Hong Kong), while the number of cases is currently in the 45.171.\nMost of the new cases continue to be detected in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, where the virus is believed to have originated in a shellfish and meat market in December. Outside that central province of China, new infections fell for the eight consecutive days.\nThis Tuesday was also the lowest number of new confirmed cases since early February, and Hubei reported less than two thousand new daily cases since February, writes the newspaper "South China Morning Post"'
'888888,0,GENEVA (Switzerland) — The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday (Feb 17) warned against "blanket measures" over the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointing out the epidemic outside of China was only affecting a "tiny" proportion of the population. \n WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva that more than 80 per cent of patients infected with the virus have mild disease and recover, while 14 per cent have severe diseases such as pneumonia. \n WHO also said that\xa0— with a mortality rate of around 2 percent\xa0— Covid-19 was "less deadly" than other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). \n WHO officials rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted to avoid risking a new nest of infection like the one on the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess off Japan. \n "Measures should be taken proportional to the situation. Blanket measures may not help," Mr Tedros said. \n The outbreak, which has infected some 70,500 people in China and killed over 1,700, has battered manufacturing and tourism across the region and led to multiple travel restrictions including for flights and cruises. \n "If we are going to disrupt every cruise ship in the world on the off chance that there might be some potential contact with some potential pathogen then where do we stop?" said Mr Michael Ryan, head of WHO\'s health emergencies programme. \n Mr Ryan said that even at the epicentre of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei Province, the "attack rate"\xa0— a measure of the speed of spread of the virus\xa0— was four per 100,000. \n "This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected. Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people," he said. \n Mr Tedros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend "must be interpreted very cautiously". \n "Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table," he said. \n Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death," he added. \n Mr Tedros said there were "relatively few cases" among children and more research was needed to understand why.

'888888,0,Disposable rubber gloves are indispensable in the global fight against the new coronavirus, yet a month’s lockdown in stricken Malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide.\nThe world’s biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, Top Glove Corp Bhd (TPGC.KL), has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks’ worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told Reuters.\nWe can’t get our gloves to hospitals without cartons, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview. Hospitals need our gloves. We can’t just supply 50% of their requirement.\nThe virus, which emerged in China at the end of last year, has left Malaysia with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. To halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from March 18 to April 14.\nGlove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. Still, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) said it was lobbying almost every hour to return the industry to full strength to minimize risk to the global fight.\nWe’re shut down, said Evonna Lim, managing director at packaging supplier Etheos Imprint Technology. We fall under an exempted category but still need approval.\nDr Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\nIf we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that’s going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do many medical procedures safely.\nGLOBAL CALL\nWith glove supplies dwindling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on its website this month said here some gloves could be used beyond their designated shelf life. On Tuesday, the United States lifted a ban on imports from Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labor.\nBritain’s Department of Health & Social Care has urged Malaysian authorities to prioritize the production and shipment of gloves that are of utmost criticality for fighting COVID-19, showed a letter dated March 20 to glove maker Supermax Corp (SUPM.KL) and shared with Reuters.\nMARGMA is considering rationing due to the extremely high demand, its president Denis Low said. You can produce as many gloves as you can but then there’s nothing to pack them into.\nUnder normal circumstances, Top Glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. For the remainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength.\nWe are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry, said Low. We are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services, even transportation.\nMalaysia’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry on Tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods.\nAUTOMATION\nDeveloped economies are home to only a fifth of the world’s population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. At 150, U.S. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of China, latest MARGMA data showed.\nMARGMA expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with Malaysia’s market share rising two percentage points to 65%. Thailand usually follows at about 18% and China at 9%.\nTop Glove said orders have doubled since February and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. Its stock, with a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market.\nThe company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed Malaysian firms, along with peer Hartalega Holdings Bhd (HTHB.KL), showed MIDF Research data. Other glove makers include Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd (KRIB.KL) and Careplus Group Bhd (CARE.KL).\nWe are fortunate enough to be in essential goods, said Lim. These few months and at least the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit.\nWith more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, Top Glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labor-intensive domestic suppliers. Packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides.\nThis outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier, said Lim. People will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more.\n'
'888888,0,(Reuters) - Another group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from the epicenter of China’s fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak were placed under quarantine at two military bases in California on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the disease rose to 12.\nThe travelers aboard two State Department-chartered cargo jets were met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening, and are to remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.\nFive of the passengers arrived exhibiting possible symptoms, two of them children, and were immediately hospitalized, along with the mother of one of the youngsters, the CDC said.\nThe latest evacuees, together with 195 Americans flown out of Wuhan, China, a week ago by the U.S. government, bring to 540 the number people subject so far to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years. Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\nThe two planes in Wednesday’s airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, arriving with 167 passenger. Of that group, three adults and a child “were determined to have a fever or a cough that warranted them being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,” the CDC said\n. The rest were placed under quarantine at two housing sites on base.\n“Because these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,” said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n“We are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,” Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\nHe stressed that the CDC’s strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n“If there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that’s not happening,” Braden said. “So right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.”\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and “doing well,” the state health agency said in a statement.\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said. Just two confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases were transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both between spouses\n.\nThe protocols in place at Travis and Miramar were previously instituted at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles, where the first group of Americans airlifted from Wuhan landed last Wednesday and are midway through their quarantine.\nThe CDC said the government expects to fly additional groups of Americans and their families from China to other U.S. military bases designated for quarantine in Texas and Nebraska.\nAs part of a U.S. public health emergency declared on Jan. 31 in response to the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently visited China.\nThe CDC also has ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited Wuhan or anywhere else in China’s Hubei Province during the past 14 days. Americans who traveled elsewhere in mainland China are subject to two weeks of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China will be directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers will be screened by the CDC.\nThe State Department also has issued a “Do Not Travel” advisory warning U.S. citizens against visits to China.\n'
'888888,0,"Right before I left, I got a little fever and cough. I quickly took (fever-lowering) medicines. I kept checking my temperature. Luckily, I managed to lower it, and my exit went smoothly."\nIt\'s supposed to be one of the women on 24-hour. In January, the new Coronavirus was diagnosed in France, on which WeChat was posted. According to BBC, the woman had previously travelled to Lyon from the city of Wuhan, where the current outbreak began. Shortly after the post, the Chinese embassy in Paris reported to the French authorities. Meanwhile, the woman has been found and is under quarantine.\nThe woman is one of three people affected by the new Coronavirus in France. The French Ministry of Health confirmed this. The other two patients had also been to China before, it was said. What do the cases mean for Europe and Germany? How much do experts already know about the virus? And how is the situation in China developing?\nThe cases are the first in Europe, but they are no surprise. For days, experts have been assuming that the virus is coming to Europe. It is also considered likely that Germany will soon register the first cases brought in. But that\'s nothing to worry about. One reason for this assessment was that the director of the Robert Koch Institute told the Today Journal of the ZDF that "outside China (...) so far there are no large chain infections". And the European Anti-Fraud Office also said on Saturday:\'European countries have the capacity to prevent and control an outbreak as soon as cases are discovered\'.\nThe ECDC was founded only as a reaction to the Sars pandemic 2002/2003, i.e. as a reaction to a pandemic whose pathogen resembles the new Coronavirus. At that time hundreds of people died worldwide, also Germany registered nine cases\nYeah. In response to the Sars pandemic, most European countries also developed pandemic plans. Germany also has a national pandemic plan, which was last revised 2016. Every two years the pandemic case and the coordination between the federation and countries in exercises is tested.\nAnd so Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, emphasises to ZEIT ONLINE: "We are very well prepared." In Hamburg, for example, the main actors, his institute, health offices and the Eppendorf University Clinic have been in close contact for days. The responsibilities were very clear.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus\nYeah. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment must be\nYeah. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nWhat could also help researchers is to understand the outbreak and the virus better, despite many gaps. The outbreak of the virus probably originated in a market in the 11-million-dollar town of Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, all kinds of wild animals such as snakes, foxes and pheasants are sold. From one of these animals, it could have been passed on to a human. On the other hand, it could have been transmitted by a bat, an analysis of the virus genomes (Biorxiv: Benvenuto et al., 2020) shows. This chain of infections is also unlikely because it resembles the Sars virus closely related to the new Coronavirus.\nHowever, it is now also clear that not all the infected were on the market. At the beginning of December, it appears that a patient has been infected elsewhere. This is shown by the data of Chinese doctors (The Lancet: Huang et al., 2020). Where exactly is unclear. Another animal reservoir or an infection from person to person is possible.\nIn general, it is now certain that the virus is effectively transmitted from person to person. The World Health Organization reported a chain of infections with four limbs, that is: a human infected himself at the animal source, then a second human infected a third, who passed the virus on to a fourth\nYeah. According to very preliminary estimates, an infected person is currently infecting 1,4 to 2,5 people. For comparison: a person who has measles has twelve people on average, a person who has the flu virus, two to three. According to previous knowledge, the new virus is therefore less infectious than the Sars agent. These figures, says the virologist Schmidt-Chanasit, are now rather a "benchmark" to assess how the epidemic is developing and what measures it needs.\nMedical practitioners also know more about the course of the virus disease. About a quarter of all cases were very difficult, the WHO said. After a first case report (New England Journal of Medicine: Zhu et al., 2020), The Lancet also published a study on the cases of illness in which data from forty-one patients from a hospital in Wuhan (Huang et al., 2020) were fed. It shows that most patients came to the hospital with fever and cough, one had diarrhoea. All patients had pneumonia detected in the CT scan. On average seven days after the first symptoms, the patients in the study were admitted to the hospital, after eight days their breath was short, and one day later lung failure followed.\nThe study also shows that some patients had heart problems. At every tenth an additional germ in the damaged pulmonary tissue was removed. Of the forty-one patients, six died, so about fifteen percent.\nIn a comment accompanying the study, however, doctors point out that many infected have few or no symptoms. It was therefore more likely that about three percent of the infected would die (The Lancet: Wang et al., 2020)\nYeah. But also this number, writers say, should be enjoyed with caution, because "not all patients have left their illness behind (i.e., died or recovered) and the true number of patients is unknown."\nAccording to official information, around 1.300 people were diagnosed with the virus at the time of the appearance of this article. In order to stop the further spread, the Chinese authorities have taken various measures. They not only try to locate and quarantine contact persons of infected people, but also have a hospital with about 1.000 beds set up on the 3rd. February should be ready. Many experts consider China\'s response to the virus to be very rapid and praise the transparency of the authorities, especially compared to the Sars epidemic.\nThe Science Media Center in Germany, SMC, is a service for quality assurance in scientific journalism. It is supported by universities, research institutes, companies and the media. Journalists and journalists of the SMC provide free-of-charge information, scientific assessments of studies and quotes of researchers on current news, on topics from medicine and life sciences, the environment and climate, energy and mobility to all editorials.\nThe SMC\'s partners are the Science Press Conference (WPK) and the Klaus Tschira Foundation in Heidelberg. The SMC was founded in the year 2015 following the British model.\nHowever, there is also criticism of the latest measures: in recent days, China has sealed off entire cities by blocking roads, railway lines and airports in Wuhan and neighbouring major cities. Around 56 million Chinese in 22 cities have been affected by this.\nMany experts do not think this is a good idea\nYeah. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of Global Health at Georgetown University, told the German Science Media Center: "A containment of Wuhan will drive the epidemic underground and trigger fear and panic." In an epidemic, the exact opposite must be done, namely "gain the trust of the community". Only in this way would people work together, allowing authorities to track infection chains seamlessly, identify contact persons of infected people and quarantine them, and ultimately contain the epidemic.\nWith information from dpa\n'

'888888,0,SEOUL (REUTERS, AFP) -\xa0South Korean officials warned against prematurely calling the peak of the coronavirus outbreak while expressing hope on Monday (March 9)\xa0that the country was nearing a“turning point” in the crisis, as the pace of new infections trended lower. \n The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 69 new coronavirus cases on Monday, although a more complete figure would be provided in another update later on Monday. \n The new cases brought South Korea’s total infections to 7,382, while the death toll rose by one to 51, the KCDC said. \n The rate of increase in new infections fell to its lowest in 10 days on Sunday in one of the countries most severely affected outside mainland China. \n “I’m still extremely cautious, but there’s hope we can reach a turning point in the near future,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Monday before returning to Seoul from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu. \n Health authorities say the number of new infections being identified has dwindled as most of the roughly 200,000 followers of a fringe Christian church at the centre of the epidemic in Daegu have now been tested. \n Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said it was premature to say the crisis was over, as new cases continued to emerge from smaller clusters. \n “There are still many patients arising from Daegu and nearby regions ... and sporadic infections continue to emerge elsewhere, though they’re not spreading as fast,” Kim told a briefing. \n “In fact, now is the time to concentrate all our capabilities to bring a clear reduction in infections.” \n South Korea started rationing surgical masks on Monday after imposing an export ban amid panic buying. \n Mutual travel restrictions imposed by South Korea and Japan also took effect, an issue that rekindled a diplomatic and economic feud between the old foes. \n South Korea suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan on Friday, after Tokyo announced travel restrictions, joining more than 100 other countries limiting arrivals from South Korea. \n The spat, together with oil price swings, sent South Korean shares and the won sharply lower and prompted the finance ministry to issue a verbal warning against disorderly market movement. \n South Korea was the first country to report significant coronavirus numbers outside China, where the disease first emerged. \n But in recent days\xa0the focus of global concern has been moving towards Italy and Iran, a quarter of Italy’s population in lockdown Sunday as Rome announced infections soaring past 7,000 and deaths spiking to 366.\xa0 \n '

They couldn\'t alert their colleagues and the public in time, despite the sacrifice. That is the most painful loss and lesson,"he said.\nAccording to the magazine, the hospital had been overwhelmed by fever patients since early January. Several were taken care of doctors who were not specialized in contagious diseases.\nThe doctors cited by the Caixin blamed the administration for "incompetence".\nThe head of the Communist Party at the hospital had no knowledge of infectious diseases and forbade doctors from disclosing critical information to public health, he found the magazine.\nAn internal document from the Central Hospital obtained by the Caixin also revealed direct interference by the Wuhan municipal health authorities, which made it difficult for the hospital to disclose cases, especially between the 12th and 17th days of last January, when the local Communist Party cadres took part in the meetings of the local legislative body.\nAccording to Caixin, an official of the Ministry of Public Security visited the hospital on January 12th, and ordered the forms on infectious diseases to be filled in and reported only after consultations with experts at the municipal and provincial level, delaying the process.\nOn January 13th, Wang Wenyong, head of the infectious disease control office of Jianghan district in Wuhan, called the hospital and asked that suspected reports of infection with the new coronavirus, filed in January 10th, be amended to show other diseases in the fileYeah.\nIn response, the hospital asked the district health authorities to collect samples, but they were told to stand by. The wait lasted three days.\nIn January 16, after the meetings of the local legislature were completed, the disease control centre of the city of Wuhan was finally collecting samples.

"888888,0,Much has been said about the 'perils' of Work From Home during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Yes, it is unbearable, in all honesty. Everybody is so done with life and sorry for making it worse, but we are just in the second day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown in India. But let's get this straight. There is really no other option at the moment. However, we can tell you something that might cheer you up even in this grim period.\nYou've read about Survival Of The Fittest enough and it is time to implement it now. Why? Because we have to survive this pandemic without any sort of help. For those living alone, especially. It is taxing because there is literally no help. You need to fend for your food, clean the house and do other chores after completing your shift. On the flipside though, did you ever think about the amount of money that you are saving while cribbing about the lockdown?\nThe silver lining, thus, on this cloud, is that if not anything else, you will walk out of this pandemic with some extra bucks in your bank account once the corona conundrum is done with.\nFor the sake of your sanity (and ours as well), we curated this list that will help you ascertain a rough estimate of the amount of money you are saving at the moment.\nTake a look:\nNO ZOMATO, NO SWIGGY\nYes, this is the worst thing about the lockdown. Not being able to order food online. Basically, coronavirus has ensured that even in this distressing situation, you cannot afford to feel bad for yourself and soothe your soul with some biryani, pizza or tandoori chicken for that matter. You just have to make do with ready-to-eat jazz or better still, cook for yourself. But thanks to Zomato and Swiggy stalling operations, you cannot even believe the amount of money you are saving. Come on, you know it. Till then, enjoy simple home-cooked food and you can gorge on Swiggy and Zomato once we are done with the pandemic.\nNO ONLINE SHOPPING\nWe understand it's frustrating not being able to shop online considering some people actually keep a part of their earnings aside every month to do this. None of the e-commerce websites are delivering stuff but look at the brighter side of the story. You can use all the money that you had kept aside to shop tons of stuff once services resume. Think about the fact that you will not have to choose between the white shirt or that red lipstick - you can actually just buy both without batting an eyelid.\nNO CONVEYANCE EXPENSES\nCab aggregators Uber and Ola have suspended their services and public transport isn't available as well.

'888888,0,NEW YORK —\xa0No matter how you look at the numbers, one country stands out from the rest: South Korea. \n In late February and early March, the number of new coronavirus infections in the country exploded from a few dozen, to a few hundred, to several thousand. \n At the peak, medical workers identified 909 new cases in a single day, Feb 29, and the country of 50 million people appeared on the verge of being overwhelmed. But less than a week later, the number of new cases halved. Within four days, it halved again — and again the next day. \n On Sunday (March 22), South Korea reported only 64 new cases, the fewest in nearly a month, even as infections in other countries continue to soar by the thousands daily, devastating health care systems and economies. Italy records several hundred deaths daily; South Korea has not had more than eight in a day. \n South Korea is one of only two countries with large outbreaks, alongside China, to flatten the curve of new infections. And it has done so without China’s draconian restrictions on speech and movement, or economically damaging lockdowns like those in Europe and the US. \n As global deaths from the virus surge past 15,000, officials and experts worldwide are scrutinising South Korea for lessons. And those lessons, while hardly easy, appear relatively straightforward and affordable: swift action, widespread testing and contact tracing, and critical support from citizens. \n Yet other hard-hit nations did not follow South Korea’s lead. Some have begun to show interest in emulating its methods — but only after the epidemic had accelerated to the point that they may not be able to control it any time soon. \n President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden have both called South Korea’s president, Mr Moon Jae-in, to request details on the country’s measures, according to Mr Moon’s office. \n The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has hailed South Korea as demonstrating that containing the virus, while difficult, “can be done”. He urged countries to “apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere”. \n South Korean officials caution that their successes are tentative. A risk of resurgence remains, particularly as epidemics continue raging beyond the country’s borders. \n Still, Mr Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has repeatedly raised South Korea as a model, writing on Twitter, “South Korea is showing Covid-19 can be beat with smart, aggressive public health.” \n LESSON 1: INTERVENE FAST, BEFORE IT’S A CRISIS \n Just one week after the country’s first case was diagnosed in late January, government officials met with representatives from several medical companies. They urged the companies to begin immediately developing coronavirus test kits for mass production, promising emergency approval. \n Within two weeks, though South Korea’s confirmed cases remained in the double digits, thousands of test kits were shipping daily. The country now produces 100,000 kits per day, and officials say they are in talks with 17 foreign governments about exporting them. \n Officials also swiftly imposed emergency measures in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million where contagion spread fast through a local church. \n “South Korea could deal with this without limiting the movement of people because we knew the main source of infection, the church congregation, pretty early on,” said Dr Ki Mo-ran, an epidemiologist advising the government’s coronavirus response. “If we learned about it later than we did, things could have been far worse.” \n South Koreans, unlike Europeans and Americans, were also primed to treat the coronavirus as a national emergency, after a 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) in the country killed 38. \n The coronavirus is thought to have a five-day incubation period, often followed by a period of mild symptoms that could be mistaken for a cold, when the virus is highly communicable. This pattern creates a lag of a week or two before an outbreak becomes apparent. What looks like a handful of cases can be hundreds; what looks like hundreds can be thousands. \n “Such characteristics of the virus render the traditional response, which emphasises lockdown and isolation, ineffective,” said Mr Kim Gang-lip, South Korea’s vice health minister. “Once it arrives, the old way is not effective in stopping the disease from spreading.” \n LESSON 2: TEST EARLY, OFTEN AND SAFELY \n South Korea has tested far more people for the coronavirus than any other country, enabling it to isolate and treat many people soon after they are infected. \n The country has conducted over 300,000 tests, for a per capita rate more than 40 times that of the US. \n “Testing is central because that leads to early detection, it minimises further spread and it quickly treats those found with the virus,” Ms Kang Kyung-wha, South Korea’s foreign minister, told the BBC, calling the tests “the key behind our very low fatality rate as well”. \n Though South Korea is sometimes portrayed as having averted an epidemic, thousands of people were infected and the government was initially accused of complacency. Its approach to testing was designed to turn back an outbreak already underway. \n To spare hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed, officials opened 600 testing centers designed to screen as many people as possible, as quickly as possible — and keep health workers safe by minimising contact. \n At 50 drive-thru stations, patients are tested without leaving their cars. They are given a questionnaire, a remote temperature scan and a throat swab. The process takes about 10 minutes. Test results are usually back within hours. \n At some walk-in centres, patients enter a chamber resembling a transparent phone booth. Health workers administer throat swabs using thick rubber gloves built into the chamber’s walls. \n Relentless public messaging urges South Koreans to seek testing if they or someone they know develop symptoms. Visitors from abroad are required to download a smartphone app that guides them through self-checks for symptoms. \n Offices, hotels and other large buildings often use thermal image cameras to identify people with fevers. Many restaurants check customers’ temperatures before accepting them. \n LESSON 3: CONTACT TRACING, ISOLATION AND SURVEILLANCE \n When someone tests positive, health workers retrace the patient’s recent movements to find, test — and, if necessary, isolate — anyone the person may have had contact with, a process known as contact tracing. \n This allows health workers to identify networks of possible transmission early, carving the virus out of society like a surgeon removing a cancer. \n South Korea developed tools and practices for aggressive contact tracing during the Mers outbreak. Health officials would retrace patients’ movements using security camera footage, credit card records, even GPS data from their cars and cellphones. \n “We did our epidemiological investigations like police detectives,” Dr Ki said. “Later, we had laws revised to prioritise social security over individual privacy at times of infectious disease crises.” \n As the coronavirus outbreak grew too big to track patients so intensively, officials relied more on mass messaging. \n South Koreans’ cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. Websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people’s travel — which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks. \n People who believe they may have crossed paths with a patient are urged to report to testing centres. \n South Koreans have broadly accepted the loss of privacy as a necessary trade-off. \n People ordered into self-quarantine must download another app, which alerts officials if a patient ventures out of isolation. Fines for violations can reach US$2,500 (S$3,600). \n By identifying and treating infections early, and segregating mild cases to special centres, South Korea has kept hospitals clear for the most serious patients. Its case fatality rate is just over 1 per cent, among the lowest in the world. \n LESSON 4: ENLIST THE PUBLIC’S HELP \n There aren’t enough health workers or body-temperature scanners to track everybody, so everyday people must pitch in. \n Leaders concluded that subduing the outbreak required keeping citizens fully informed and asking for their cooperation, said Mr Kim, the vice health minister. \n Television broadcasts, subway station announcements and smartphone alerts provide endless reminders to wear face masks, pointers on social distancing and the day’s transmission data. \n The messaging instills a near-wartime sense of common purpose. Polls show majority approval for the government’s efforts, with confidence high, panic low and scant hoarding. \n “This public trust has resulted in a very high level of civic awareness and voluntary cooperation that strengthens our collective effort,” Mr Lee Tae-ho, the vice minister of foreign affairs, told reporters earlier this month. \n Officials also credit the country’s nationalised health care system, which guarantees most care, and special rules covering coronavirus-related costs, as giving even people with no symptoms greater incentive to get tested. \n IS THE KOREAN MODEL TRANSFERABLE? \n For all the attention to South Korea’s successes, its methods and containment tools are not prohibitively complex or expensive. \n Some of the technology the country has used is as simple as specialised rubber gloves and cotton swabs. Of the seven countries with worse outbreaks than South Korea’s, five are richer. \n Experts cite three major hurdles to following South Korea’s lead, none related to cost or technology. \n One is political will. Many governments have hesitated to impose onerous measures in the absence of a crisis-level outbreak. \n Another is public will. Social trust is higher in South Korea than in many other countries, particularly Western democracies beset by polarisation and populist backlash. \n But time poses the greatest challenge. It may be “too late,” Dr Ki said, for countries deep into epidemics to control outbreaks as quickly or efficiently as South Korea has. \n China turned back the catastrophic first outbreak in Hubei, a province larger than most European countries, though at the cost of shutting down its economy. \n South Korea’s methods could help the US, though “we probably lost the chance to have an outcome like South Korea”, Mr Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, wrote on Twitter. “We must do everything to avert the tragic suffering being borne by Italy.” THE NEW YORK TIMES \n '

"888888,0,Sir, sir.\nPresident of the Portuguese Republic\nDr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa,\nFirst of all, I would like to congratulate you on having declared the state of emergency in Portugal and on your subsequent speech to the country. Indeed, the times we live in are terrible and merciless. And they have no pity or hesitation.\nThat's why your word and action are important. Personally, I was also very pleased that there was almost unanimity in answering this question by the Assembly of the Republic and the Government. But now, in the very short time available to us (and which is being shortened by the hour) more and more needs to be done, of a health and political nature!\nI therefore appeal to you, as a Portuguese and a European citizen, to exert your enormous symbolic and diplomatic influence on countries or regions that have shared historical, commercial and mutual help relations with Portugal for more than 500 years now, so that you can help us now, at this time of enormous need. Of course, I am talking about Japan and the People's Republic of China, with special emphasis on the Macao Special Administrative RegioYeah. Indeed, fruit of having had to deal with the SARS epidemic at the beginning of this millennium and now with that of Covid-19, China and its Special Administrative Regions are prepared like no other country, with possible exceptions from Japan and South Korea, to help us in this fight which, Having now come to us in a most astonishing way, he will not soon let us sleep soundly!\nThis aid should not only be of a material nature, with its protective, diagnostic and treatment equipment (e.g. masks, medicines and fans) that we already have and will be increasingly lacking in our NHS, as the situation gets worse, but also and perhaps above all, should be through sharing epidemiological knowledge and public health! In fact, it is high time that we had foreign experts to help us, especially in Lisbon and with the government, and, if this is not possible, at least with the help of videoconferences, to advise advisers, advisors and, ideally and directly, those responsible for conducting this fight, Mr President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and the Director of the DGS. Not to mention the specialized council of the members of the National Board of Health or at least evident National Public Health Council!\nMr President, I have had my students without classes for more than a week, but our teachers are doing their best, as are many other teachers across the country, to try to mitigate this situation by giving distance lessons. But much worse, I also have countless colleagues and friends who have long since clashed in emergency rooms, in the wards and in intensive care of St John's University Hospital Centre, committed to tracking down and treating patients with Covid-19 and adding to their usual patientYeah. And at this moment, beating each other almost as much as much before had been done by their grandparents or great-grandparents in the trenches of the First War in La Lys. And if we consider what remains to be done to reach the peak of the epidemic, we are still at the beginning of its progression in Portugal.\nIn other words, Mr President, in a time of absolute truth and emergency, it is time for us not to be afraid to confess our own limitations as a country, as politicians or even as experts, and, recognising this, it is time to ask for help from those who are best able to help us!\nAnd above all, not forgetting that delaying or postponing it, just for a day or a few hours, from a correct decision to isolate the population more narrowly or to screen more intensively cases in the population could prevent the death of a very considerable number of Portuguese people. Moreover, when the current number of deaths in Portugal, as in all other countries, will be underestimated, by possible non-recognition of Covid-19's diagnosis at the time of the registration of our patients'deaths, and also by excessive deaths, in patients not infected with Covid-19, by SNS overload.\nWith the best personal and institutional compliments"

They had tested positive and were taken from the ship to the hospital where they died.\nAfter two weeks of virus quarantine, the first 443 passengers who were still barely 3.000 on the cruise ship had landed on Wednesday.

In Hubei, too, the new infections went back to 349 compared to the day before 1.649. Several cities also reported negative numbers for the new infections.\nThe sharp decline in viral diseases is due to an adapted diagnostic procedure. According to the Health Commission, clinical diagnoses are no longer to include officially confirmed cases in the statistics. Last week, the particularly affected province of Hubei, where the virus had originally broken out in the millionth city of Wuhan, had begun to include diagnoses based on a combination of factors such as lung formation and physical conditionYeah. Now only laboratory tests are to be considered, but according to experts in the past they have not always recognised obvious diseases.\nAs a whole, according to official information, so far 74.576 people in China have the mentioned lung disease caused by the Coronavirus.

'888888,0,TEHRAN (Iran) — Two people have died in Iran after testing positive on Wednesday (Feb 19) for the new coronavirus, the health ministry said, in the Islamic republic\'s first cases of the disease. \n According to YJC news agency, a branch of state television, the pair who died were Iranian citizens and residents of the holy city of Qom. \n They are also the first deaths from the Covid-19 virus in the Middle East and only the seventh and eighth outside China, where the outbreak has killed more than 2,000 people. \n State news agency IRNA quoted Kianoush Jahanpour, a ministry spokesman, as saying the virus was detected in two elderly people with immunity problems in Qom, south of the Iranian capital. \n "Following the recent cases of chronic respiratory diseases in Qom, two of the patients tested positive in preliminary tests," it quoted him as saying. \n "Unfortunately both passed away in the intensive care unit due to old age and issues with their immune system." \n IRNA had earlier quoted Mr Jahanpour as saying that the "new coronavirus" had been confirmed in two people and that other suspected cases were isolated. \n The state news agency also quoted a media adviser to Iran\'s health minister as saying two people had died after testing positive for the coronavirus. \n "Both of the people who had tested positive for coronavirus were in Qom and were old.

'888888,1,● what is the development of "Wuhan pneumonia" in Taiwan this week? It is said that the government began to adopt "electronic monitoring". Will this make the control measures more effective?\nIt should be more effective. Taiwan\'s central epidemic command center held an emergency press conference at 8:00 p.m. on the 28th. Chen Shizhong, Minister of health and welfare, personally announced that the "severe special infectious pneumonia" in Taiwan had its eighth confirmed case, which was the first local case in Taiwan since the outbreak.\nThis local case is the fifth confirmed case in Taiwan. The husband of the "Wuhan female Taiwanese businessman" was infected because they lived together. It was determined to be "family cluster infection". In addition, the male Taiwanese businessmen with the previous third confirmed case should have been isolated at home for 14 days after returning to Taiwan, but they did not implement it. They took the MRT, went to the dance hall and went to the Department of dermatology in Kaohsiung. After the diagnosis of the disease, Kaohsiung was panicked. Taiwan\'s government has implemented "electronic monitoring" on those who must be isolated at home since the 29th. There are two types of people who must be isolated at home, including "contacts of confirmed cases" and "returnees from Hubei".\nAt present, there are about two thousand of these two kinds of people. Each local health bureau will send them a mobile phone with positioning function, which can be monitored in real time through the line community software. Within 14 days of monitoring, the local health unit will actively monitor twice a day through video phone, and the home isolators will also regularly reply to their physical conditions. If they are found to leave or have abnormalities, such as deliberately putting the mobile phone at home After running out, the quarantine personnel will send a message to ask for a reply, and ask to return to the isolation point immediately. If they do not cooperate, the police will immediately assist in finding people, or even force isolation and resettlement. Taiwan officials even revealed that three compulsory isolation places in the north, South and central China have been arranged, but at present, they can\'t explain where they are. ● over the past week, the United States, Britain, France and Japan have all arranged for the evacuation of overseas Chinese. It was once said that Taiwan would also send charter flights to Wuhan to evacuate the Taiwanese people. What\'s the situation now?\nThere are more than 2000 Taiwanese businesses in Wuhan for a long time, so it may be difficult to evacuate all of them. At present, the mainland Committee of Taiwan has focused on more than 300 of them. Most of these people come to Wuhan for various reasons, such as temporary business trips, personal travel or family visits. They do not live in local Taiwanese businessmen for a long time. As a result, the city is suddenly closed, making them unable to leave. Some people are short of medicine, living in poor environment, and the situation is worrying. During the Spring Festival, Taiwan government agencies received a More than 100 calls for help\n。\nThe Taiwan Land Commission said it had inquired the mainland through the SEF about the possibility of "chartering back to Taiwan", but the mainland did not respond.\nAs a result, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the people\'s Republic of China responded publicly that since the outbreak of the pneumonia, the Taiwan compatriots in Hubei had been properly taken care of. By the afternoon of January 27, no Taiwan compatriots had been found to be infected with the disease. The Taiwan Affairs Office of Hubei Province and Wuhan city also cared about the situation of the Taiwan compatriots and solved their difficulties in a timely manner. The Taiwan Affairs Office also said that the mainland has always maintained communication with Taiwan related parties, arranged for Taiwan experts to visit Wuhan, and has been timely informing and providing data, and will continue to maintain such communication and coordination in the future. As for the request for chartered flights to evacuate the Taiwan compatriots, the state Taiwan Affairs Office only briefly said that the Association received a letter from the foundation at 6 p.m. on the 27th. However, the state Taiwan Affairs Office did not say whether it agreed. So far, the matter of evacuating the Taiwan compatriots in Wuhan has not been discussed below.\n● during the Spring Festival, some counties and cities in Taiwan have seen long queues of people buying masks. Before that, Taiwan officials also announced that the export of masks is prohibited. Has there been a shortage of masks in Taiwan?\nOn New Year\'s Eve, Su Zhenchang, Taiwan\'s chief executive, ordered that the export of medical surgical masks and N95 masks be stopped for one month. This measure was immediately criticized by Lanying. Cai Zhengyuan, the former executive director of the Kuomintang policy meeting, wrote in a Facebook address that when the fire broke out in Australia, Cai Ying Wen announced to donate masks to Australia. However, in Wuhan, the mainland, with pneumonia, Cai Ying Wen\'s government announced to ban the export of masks, which he thought was strange. He stressed that the smart way to win over international public opinion is to donate masks to the mainland. He exclaimed, "I haven\'t seen such a stupid politician.".\nSecondly, a Taiwanese blogger wrote an article on the Internet, saying that his wife\'s family from mainland China was in the disaster area of the epidemic and could not buy masks. So he and his wife bought masks everywhere in Taiwan in a few days. They bought a total of 2000 masks and were going to send them to their relatives in mainland China to help them through the difficulties. As a result, two groups of netizens argued on the Internet. One group thought that it was not advisable to sweep the goods to save their relatives, but it was not too harsh. The other group thought that Taiwanese were not enough, and that it was too much to scrape 2000 masks.\nIn fact, there is no shortage of masks in Taiwan, but it is also a fact that there are people lining up to buy masks during the Spring Festival. In some places, the long lines are hundreds of meters long, which is really worrying\n。 However, this should be a temporary phenomenon. On the one hand, the official ban on the export of masks is the main reason. On the other hand, the production of mask factories is not large due to the suspension of work during the Spring Festival. In addition, people\'s expectations finally lead to the phenomenon of rush buying. But the first day after the Spring Festival on the 30th, the problem has been solved. As a result of the coordination between the government and the mask manufacturers, the manufacturers stepped up their work. The government purchased 4 million masks from the operators every day, and unified the distribution channels for the whole Taiwan. Judging from the current epidemic situation in Taiwan, the supply of masks should not be a problem, but the problem is the hostile political position of both sides.\nIn addition, the World Health Organization again held an emergency committee meeting in Geneva on the 30th, but still did not invite Taiwan experts to attend. What is Taiwan\'s response?\nWHO (WHO) secretary general Tan Desai (Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus) visited Beijing several days ago to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. After 29 returned to Geneva, a press conference was held in the evening. She said that although the number of cases outside China is still very small, the potential of global transmission is likely to expand further. Therefore, WHO30 will convene experts to discuss the new coronavirus pneumonia. Whether the epidemic constitutes an international public health emergency. At the press conference, the media asked why Taiwan was not invited to participate in the conference. Ryan, executive director of who emergency health events, replied that Taiwan experts participated in who related consultation, clinical and laboratory work, so Taiwan fully participated in and fully understood all the development. In response, Lane asked Maria van kerkhove, the deputy head of the emerging diseases department of who, to add to the questions about the participation of Taiwan experts. Van khove also said that the who did contact all countries with cases. Therefore, although Taiwan requests to participate in the WHO meeting every time a global infectious disease occurs, it also accuses China of not preventing Taiwan from participating, and China also responds, and Taiwan can get all the information. From who\'s point of view, I\'m afraid there is no plan to let Taiwan participate in the meeting in the short term.\nThe Ministry of foreign affairs of Taiwan stressed that Taiwan has a sound medical and epidemic prevention system, and is capable and ready to make specific contributions. It once again appealed to WHO to hold the profession and invite Taiwan to attend the expert meeting against new coronaviruses.\n。 Taiwan also called on who to put aside political pressure, work professionally and neutrally to implement the purpose of "achieving the highest level of human health" as stipulated in the Charter of the organization, and resume inviting Taiwan to attend the World Health Assembly held in Geneva in May as an observer, so as to ensure that there is no loophole in global epidemic prevention.\n'
'888888,0,Covid-19 continues to spread globally. These diseases have been confirmed by the staff of various ministries, the surroundings of the first group of people and even their family members.\nThe spread of HIV / AIDS has had a serious impact on the global situation, particularly the economy. National emergencies, combined with the global economic recession, cannot fail to affect the policies of the whole world. This is not only because officials are infected with the same infection, quarantined and cancelled visits and meetings. The epidemic could hinder the global political process and trigger new crises.\nElection in the United States\nAt first, the president of the United States said the situation in Colorado was under full control and called on Americans to buy securities. But as disease rates rise, White House optimism has nothing to do with reality.\nInitially, trap persuaded the nation that the United States was ready to fight covid-19. However, when the number of people infected reached thousands, the president had to declare a state of emergency. The springboard order to cancel flights from the EU has drawn more criticism, especially in Brussels. The EU is outraged that the president made the decision without any warningAbout This shows once again the cold relationship between the EU and the US. However, the original "springboard flight restriction order" did not cover the UK, which was the country where the Deputy Minister of health found corona velos. Although later measures were taken against the kingdom.\nLast week, trainmar met with the Brazilian delegation and with Brazilian official Fabio waingateng. Soon, they found coronavirus in the last place. Still, the president and his deputy, Michael burns, did not go to quarantine as recommended. The division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea is limited to one test showing adverse results. At the same time, Senator Lindsay Graham also met with members of the Brazilian delegation and decided to be held incommunicado.\nThe rise in incidence is one of the biggest challenges we face during President Trump\'s term. At the same time, these tests are the culmination of the US campaign. The president\'s foolish decision may make him vote in the near future. Democrats in particular blocked the Colorado virus initiative from the podium. Last week, Joe Biden, a potential rival in the election, put forward his country\'s plan to get out of crisis. And Democrats in the house of Representatives passed a special agreemenAbout In addition, the epidemic is a challenge to the entire United States health system. In the context of the spread of the virus, Senator Bernie Sanders\'s commitment can bring new voices to voters. However, Biden and Sanders were forced to cancel some rallies for public safety reasons.\nSchengen crisis\nItaly is one of the main sources of virus transmission in Europe. Rome\'s decision to close the national isolation and isolation of the population - 60 million people - immediately triggered a response from neighbouring countries. Austria, Slovenia, Hungary and Switzerland have tightened controls on the Italian border, checking travelers\' health and asking for medical certificates. Travel and transportation are restricted. Since 16 March, Germany has closed its borders with Austria, Denmark, France and Switzerland. The virus has virtually eliminated the EFA.\nThe European Commission and Frontex, the European border service, confirmed that they had infected staff. If the spread of disease in the EU continues to worsen, it is possible to close the borders of the whole EU. Cases of coronavirus have been recorded in all Community countries. The crisis once again shows the fragility of European solidarity and the inability of the EU to act in unisonAbout The spread of this virus forces countries to choose their own strategies. " The new migration crisis exacerbated the situation and spread across the EU\'s external borders.\nMarina Chino pagliarello, a professor at the London School of economics, points out that the eurozone is experiencing a convergence of two major issues: "health and immigration, they overlap." In Europe, there is a lack of trust and solidarity. "\n"Europe is paying the price for lack of cohesion and common policies," the experts stressed. The only way to successfully solve this problem is to take responsibility for this crisis. " A similar view was expressed by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von draen. " Banning the flow of people is not the most effective way for Colorado virus. EU countries must take corresponding measures, "she said.\nYash Muk, an expert on democracy and democracy at Johns Hopkins University, pointed out that although people in the opposition may use the spread of the virus to achieve their goals, For those already in power, the crisis could be a severe test.\n"You can have a government that is divorced from reality until you have a serious crisis," he saiAbout "But in the face of a global pandemic, boasting and denying reality will be a crisis of trust for the people."\nMigrants and refugees\nSo far, the biggest outbreaks have been in prosperous and relatively stable countries - China, Iran, Japan, Italy and South Korea. Each of them has a strong central government and organized medical services. However, in countries with less developed health systems, the virus is not only difficult to control, but also difficult to detect. This applies to a number of African countries as well as to war zones in Syria, Libya and Yemen.\nAnother major problem is the large number of refugees in Europe and the Middle East. In fact, these people are excluded from any social security. They live in crowded refugee camps with poor sanitation. This makes them most vulnerable to the epidemic. Millions of displaced people are scattered in Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey, Syria and Iran. Against this background, the Turkish government\'s decision not to stop the flow of refugees to Europe will only attract more attention. The uncontrolled flow of people without access to basic medical services only exacerbates the spread of the diseaseAbout\nImpact on China\nUnlike in the west, civil liberties are still a sensitive topic for the government, and China is not afraid to take severe measures to control the disease. About 150 million people in the country are not free to leave their homes. The authorities have successfully established one of the largest quarantine systems in the world. Although Beijing has achieved some success in the prevention and control of coronavirus, the political and economic impact of the Chinese people\'s infection remains to be estimated.\nIn general, society seems to be in line with a country\'s actions, which are more like a natural disaster. But the strong reaction of social networks to the death of Li Wenliang\'s young doctor in Wuhan proves that the Chinese people can also hold the authorities accountable at any time.\nAnother area, the Hong Kong rebellion, remains a problem for Beijing. The virus reduced street activity, but further worsened the relationship between protesters and local authorities. The administration in the region has been taking preventive measures for too long. Despite a large number of Chinese citizens, the news about Colorado has long been of secondary importance. The border with mainland China was closed only after protesters demanded it in February. These speeches are even supported by the ruling party. SARS killed 299 people in 2003About In Hong Kong\'s parliamentary election in September 2020, the government\'s hesitation and pessimism of protesters will inevitably be affected.\nLast week, coronaveros officially acknowledged the global crisis. Experts hope that this will change with hot weather or the discovery of vaccines. Serious consequences for the well-being of mankind as a whole are likely to be avoidable. But the political impact of the epidemic seems to be just beginning.\nDmitry beliaye'

'888888,0,The World Health Organisation (WHO) decided this Wednesday to re-convene the Emergency Committee on Thursday to determine whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus from China should be an international public health emergency.\nThe decision was communicated on Twitter this Wednesday by the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, after a week ago the organisation deemed the international public health emergency declaration premature at the end of a two-day meeting of the same committee, consisting of experts, including epidemiologists.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus justified the convening, again, of the Emergency Committee with the "risk of worldwide spread" of the coronavirus (family of viruses causing pneumonia). The meeting shall take place at the headquarters of the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland.\nThis Wednesday, China elevated to 132 dead and more than 5.900 infected the balance of the new coronavirus detected in December in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, in the center of the country.\nIn addition to mainland China, cases of infection have also been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Finland.\nAn international public health emergency requires the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures.\nTo state this, the WHO considers three criteria: an extraordinary situation, a risk of rapid expansion to other countries and a coordinated international response.\nAccording to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, although most of the infections occurred in China, with only 68 confirmed cases in other 15 countries, an inter-human transmission was recorded outside China (Germany, Vietnam and Japan)\nYeah.\n"Although the figures outside China are still relatively low, they are likely to give rise to a much larger epidemic", he said at a press conference at the WHO headquarters.\nAccording to the Director General of WHO, most infected people have "mild symptoms", but one in five suffers from a serious illness such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.\n"The whole world must be on alert, the whole world must act," stated the director of the WHO emergency programs, Michael Ryan, in Geneva.\nOn Sunday, the Director-General of WHO visited China, where he met with government representatives and health experts.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this Wednesday that he had "frank meetings" with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, who put into practice "a monumental national response".\nOn Tuesday, the WHO announced the dispatch of international experts to China.\nThe international public health emergency was declared for the epidemics of influenza H1N1 in 2009 of the Zika virus in 2016, polio in 2014, and Ebola, which struck part of West Africa, from 2014 to 2016, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018.\nThe number of cases of infection with the new coronavirus, provisionally designated by the WHO as "2019-nCoV", exceeds the number of infections recorded with the epidemic of Acute Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by another coronavirus, but also detected in China and spread to other countries in 2002 and 2003.\nSARS infected five.327 people in China and provoked 774 deaths in the world, including 349 in mainland China.\n'
'888888,0,JAKARTA/BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia is not hiding anything over the coronavirus, the health minister said on Tuesday, after some medical researchers expressed concern that cases may have gone undetected in the world’s fourth most populous country.\nWhile the virus has quickly spread from China throughout much of the rest of the region and beyond, the sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases so far.\nDozens of cases have been recorded in other regional countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, where one person has died, raising suspicions on social media in particular over a potential lack of vigilance in Indonesia.\nResearchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, then said in a study last week that Indonesia should rapidly strengthen outbreak surveillance and control - especially given that it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.\nThe Harvard team said that Indonesia’s lack of confirmed cases “may suggest the potential for undetected cases” as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China.\nThe virus has killed over 1,000, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China and 319 cases in 24 other countries. Many of the cases outside China have been in people who have a history of travelling to the country.\n“We have the kits to check coronavirus and they’re certified ... Nothing is concealed,” Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said after a cabinet meeting at the Bogor presidential palace outside Jakarta, in response to the concerns.\nIndonesia has tested 64 samples from suspected coronavirus infections - 62 of which were declared negative with two still being tested, health ministry Research and development agency head Siswanto said during a tour of its laboratory in Jakarta.\nNavaratnasamy Paranietharan, the WHO’s Indonesia representative, told a conference on Tuesday: “Indonesia has taken concrete measures and the World Health Organization is quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.”\nIndonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there.\nVivi Setiawaty, another health ministry official, said it was unclear why Indonesia had not seen any cases but said authorities were better prepared since facing H5N1 avian influenza from 2005. “We remain cautious,” she told reporters.\nIndonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the archipelago including three in Jakarta and has also quarantined more than 240 of its citizens evacuated from Hubei province, home to Wuhan, to the island of Natuna, north of Borneo.\nThe WHO’s Paranietharan said it appeared unlikely, as some have suggested, that the hot tropical climate could be a factor in curbing cases though more data would be required to be sure.\n“It doesn’t make sense at this point whether that could be the reason why we don’t have coronavirus cases in Indonesia,” Paranietharan said.\n'
'888888,0,On the afternoon of Tuesday, 17 March, the round table television programme discussed Cuba\'s strategy to control and prevent the expansion of covid-19, inviting the following panellists:\nDr. Francisco dur á n Garc í a, director of national epidemiology, Ministry of health and social welfare of Cuba, director of the centre for health promotion and disease prevention, Ministry of health and social welfare of Cuba, Dr. Jorge Delgado bustello Mar í a Guadalupe Guzman tirado, director of ipk research, diagnosis and reference center\nDr. Francisco dur á n Garc í a, director of national epidemiology, Ministry of public health (minsap), introduced the latest world development of SARS cov-2 coronary aneurysm, which is the cause of the risk of HIV / AIDS and infectious diseases.\nPhoto: screen capture shows that since the first case was found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, progress has been very rapid.\nHe explained that the latest figures showed that the number of countries with at least one case was 144. According to the latest data released on Tuesday, more than 180000 people were infected and more than 7000 died.\nDr. Duran Garcia stressed China\'s efforts to contain the virus and pointed out that more than 98000 people outside China had been infected with the virus, with a mortality rate of 4%, higher than during the most severe period in China.\nWith regard to the situation on the island, he confirmed the emergence of two new cases of covid-19 in Cuba, with seven patients diagnosed with the disease.\nHe pointed out that almost all infectious diseases have a feature that they are transmitted through contact with foreign infected persons.no\n"We cannot talk about the presence of infectious diseases in our country, because when we start to find people with HIV, whether they have symptoms or not, they are associated with any infected people from abroad or with them. \'we are preparing for this,\' he said.\nThis means that since January, Cuba has developed a plan for the prevention and control of the epidemic, and since then, a series of actions have been carried out under the leadership of the main national authorities in the country, as the disease requires cross sectoral prevention and treatment.\nThe director of the national epidemiology division of the Ministry of health added that the plan had incorporated knowledge of clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic characteristics.\nIn our country, there is no land border and good control. This advantage minimizes the risk of entering our country, because this person may be spreading disease and has not been detected at the time of entry.\nFrom the beginning, we have taken measures to isolate people with the characteristics of the disease in designated centres, enabling us to closely monitor nearly 25000 primary health care workers and anyone from countries at risk of the epidemic.\nTwo new cases of covid-19 have been reported, bringing the total number of infections in Cuba to seven.\nHe reported that today, the laboratory of the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical Medicine confirmed the diagnosis of Cuba\'s seventh case, almost all of whom came from countries of transmission, two of whom had very close ties with people abroad.\nOn the issue of quarantine, he pointed out that "this measure is formulated in every country, because the situation of quarantine is becoming more complex, not international".no\nIf the prescribed measures are taken and there is no evidence of the spread of the disease in a group of cases, then isolation is not justified.\nSimilarly, he explained that shutting down workplaces and educational institutions creates stress and stress, a process known to reduce the body\'s immune capacity and increase risk.\nAware of this, the country has taken measures in recent days to prevent population aggregation.\n4、 Why is Cuba not taking extreme measures?\nCommenting on why Cuba did not take extreme measures such as quarantine, he explained that quarantine was carried out by each country according to its characteristics. The World Health Organization has developed phased implementation measures.\nThe expert reiterated that all cases found in Cuba were not transmitted but were due to infection abroad.\n"Segregation is determined on the basis of dissemination and there is no reason at present. \'we didn\'t try to get there,\' he said.\nIt noted that it would also be unwise to close schools or workplaces before domestic broadcasting.\nIf there is no obvious spread and school closure, there will be additional pressure and reduced immunity. He stressed that Cuba noted and publicly announced that a highly populated group had ceased its activities. "\nCuba and acute respiratory infections\nMar í a Guadalupe Guzm á n tirado, director of the research, diagnosis and reference centre, outlined acute respiratory infection (IRA), which experts believe is the cause of 3 to 5 million deaths worldwide. Despite the abuse of antibiotics and other secondary conditionsno\n"` in other words, we have encountered this disease in history, most of which are viral, sometimes accompanied by inappropriate use of antibiotics, and confusion due to the similarity of symptoms such as pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, etc., he warned.\nHe said that Cuba has not evaded this reality. Anger is the main cause of death due to infection in our country, but it is also the cause of hospitalization, and in many cases it is also the cause of abuse of antibiotics, because most antibiotics are viral, although bacterial infection can also produce viruses. In addition, it has resulted in absenteeism and absenteeism.\nIn anger, he said, the virus dominates and produces a variety of symptoms, including nephritis, common cold and downhill pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and bronchitis in children. Different viruses can produce the same symptoms\nIn this regard, he stressed that the viruses we talked about include influenza A, influenza B, parasitic diseases, enteroviruses d68 and other emerging viruses and coronaviruses that shook the world in 2009.\nMonitoring of respiratory infections in the Cuban system\nThe director of ipk research, diagnosis and Reference Center pointed out that the coronary artery worm is a well-known virus population, which was identified in the 1930s as affecting many animals, such as birds, bats, rabbits, horses, mice and pigs, producing respiratory system and diarrhea, including nervous system.\nIn the 1960s, a group of coronary aneurysms were found, which affected people and became zoos. There are four basic principles, all monitored by Cuba.\nIn this global emergency, more active follow-up is under way, but national health systems monitor viral respiratory and bacterial infections on a daily basis.no\n"Personal care can only be done by individuals," he said.\nDr. Guzman tirado explained that the coronary artery virus is a "preputial soft virus RNA virus" Because of these characteristics, people often talk about hand washing or using chlorine or alcohol as part of personal care to deal with these problems because they are easy to solve.\nPersonal care can only be done by everyone. When someone sneezes, if we touch any entrance, such as mouth, eyes or nose, we may be infected with any kind of virus. Therefore, frequent hand washing is required.\n"However, the occurrence of coronary aneurysm in Wuhan at the end of 2019 is a new disease, which is known to be very similar to the isolated SARS in bats. Bats are a collection of different viruses."\nHe recalled that in 2009, mortality was high in the eastern Mediterranean, between 30 and 35 per cent, and that economic and social development in southern Africa had been strengthened. In 2012, the death rate of SARS in China was 9%, which was very serious.\nAs for the new coronary artery aneurysm virus, because it is similar to the SARS virus in bats, ipk experts believe that although there may be an unrecognized intermediate host, it is likely to come from bats.\n"` when viewed through an electron microscope, its eyeball is similar to the crown, which is called the coronary artery.\nPhoto: screen capture technology is necessary for covid-19 detection.\nOn the other hand, Dr. Mar í a Guadalupe Guzman tirado, director of the ipk research, diagnosis and reference center, explained that acute respiratory infection was one of the causes of death among 3 to 5 million people worldwide, and Cuba was not spared.no These viruses may cause a range of different types of symptoms, so different viruses may produce the same symptoms.\nAccording to experts, this kind of coronary artery was diagnosed by the former nasofarinigeo, which is a cheap technology with a cost of up to $50. We have not only ipk, but also Villa Clara and Santiago in Cuba. "We also have reagents, professionals, laboratories, equipment and so on," he said.\nWith regard to the Convention on the rights of the child, doctors stressed that the Convention has three main functions: Research on infectious diseases, specialized services and teaching. The center provides treatment for people living with HIV / AIDS in accordance with the protocol of the World Health Organization, China\'s experience and China\'s experience.\nIn terms of teaching, staff of the Cuban health system and other institutions, i.e. staff from different sectors, as well as trainers who impart knowledge in other centres, have been trained.\nIn addition, communication with scientists from other countries and the international health organization is not only for the treatment of coronary artery aneurysm, but also for the prevention and treatment of other diseases. The expert thanked the solidarity with Cuba.\nDiagnosis of new coronary artery\nThe diagnosis of this coronavirus was carried out through the former nasofarinegeo. In this case, we found the particles of the virus through the advanced molecular technology, the so-called real-time global warming potential, which was used to identify different types of viruses.\nThey are modern and expensive methods. Real time PSR testing could cost between $40 and $50, he said.no\nHe added that the technology was available at ipk in Cuba and at three laboratories at provincial health and epidemiological centres in Havana, Villa Clara and Santiago.\nPrevious photos\n4、 Strengthening community participation\n17. Pablo FeAl Canizares, head of the unit for health promotion and disease prevention, said that in Cuba, the health system has taken action to protect people. He said the plan is in line with the country\'s and the rest of the world\'s health experience.\nFamily doctor clinics and polyclinics have been organized to provide closer care, she said. The main task now is to identify vulnerable groups, such as people over 60 years of age or with respiratory diseases, those living alone and elderly homes.\nIn addition to the disinfection campaign, he argued, family doctors have intensified active investigations, prioritized the group and looked for respiratory symptoms in order to take immediate action.\nHe said the plan provided for certification of each process, explaining that more specialized training was now needed after training activities were carried out nationwide.\nAnyone can view this photo\nWith regard to the publicity plan, Pablo FeAl Ca ñ azas added that the level of public participation had increased and that the state media had provided timely and authentic information, highlighting the risks but not causing panic.\n"The most important thing is to convey the message of trust, security and the need of the Cuban people for self-protection.".\nAt the same time, media publicity and education materials have been produced, and interdepartmental participation has been increased. Each organization has its own missionno\nThe expert recommends that if respiratory symptoms occur, you should see a doctor as soon as possible and avoid leaving the country, and if you travel and return, you should be examined by the health authorities.\n"Above all, Cubans have to be cautious, responsible and cautious," he said.\nHe reiterated that money laundering was the most effective measure to prevent the disease. As for the nasobuco people, he called on the Cubans to show their solidarity because they could make them in their own homes. "The purpose of industrial production is to ensure that people in direct contact with infected or suspicious persons (such as doctors) wear masks.".\n[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument>

'888888,0,India is among the top 30 countries at "high-risk" from the spread of the deadly coronavirus, according to a study based on the number of air travellers predicted to arrive in the countries from the worst affected cities in China.\nResearchers from the University of Southampton in the UK compiled a list of cities and countries they believe are at high risk from the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) -- which has killed over 100 people so far, and infected thousands.\nThe most "at risk" countries or regions worldwide are Thailand (1), Japan (2), and Hong Kong (3). The US is 6th on the list, Australia 10th, the UK 17th and India 23rd, the researchers said in the study released on Tuesday.\nAccording to the study by the university\'s WorldPop team, Bangkok in Thailand is currently the city most at risk from a global spread of the virus. Hong Kong is second on the list, followed by Taipei in Taiwan.\nSydney, New York and London are among the top 20 other major international cities ranked in the research, released on Tuesday.\nWithin mainland China, the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chongqing are all identified as high-risk by the researchers, along with the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Henan.\n"It\'s vital that we understand patterns of population movement, both within China and globally, in order to assess how this new virus might spread -- domestically and internationally," said Andrew Tatem, a professor at the University of Southampton.\n"By mapping these trends and identifying high-risk areas, we can help inform public health interventions, such as screenings and healthcare preparedness," Tatem said\n.\nThe team used anonymised mobile phone and IP address data -- which helps to identify devices -- along with international air travel data to understand typical patterns of movement of people within China, and worldwide, during the annual 40-day Lunar New Year celebrations.\nFrom this, they identified 18 Chinese cities -- including Wuhan -- at high-risk from the new coronavirus, and established the volume of air passengers likely to be travelling from these cities to global destinations over a three month period.\nThe team, including researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada, and the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, was then able to rank the top 30 most at-risk countries and cities around the world.\nThe researchers acknowledge that their analysis is based on \'non-outbreak\' travel patterns, but highlight that a high proportion of people travelled with symptoms at an early stage of the outbreak, before restrictions were put in place.\nTravel cordons are likely to have only coincided with the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan for the holiday period, the researchers noted.\nAccording to Wuhan authorities, it is likely that more than five million people had already left the city, they said.\n"The spread of the new coronavirus is a fast-moving situation and we are closely monitoring the epidemic in order to provide further up-to-date analysis on the likely spread," said Shengjie Lai from the University of Southampton.\n"This includes the effectiveness of the transport lockdown in Chinese cities and transmission by people returning from the Lunar New Year holiday, which has been extended to February 2," said Lai.\n'

'888888,0,Tass, 21 January. Indian authorities have announced increased controls at the Calcutta International Airport in the eastern part of the country to deal with the risk of the spread of pneumonia, It was triggered by a new coronavirus 2019 ncov found in China. The times of India reported on Tuesday.\n"We have designated a special area for passengers and crew from China," said airport director Kosik batacharji. We asked them to use a scanner to detect a person\'s temperature rise. If fever is found, they will be sent to an infectious disease hospital. "\nHe said airport authorities had not found signs of a new type of pneumonia among the arrivals.\nOn December 31, Chinese authorities informed the world health organization that an unknown outbreak of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, central China.

'888888,0,The number of confirmed infections has risen sharply again following the new census of viral outbreaks in China. Only in the severely affected province of Hubei in Central China were added 4823 proven infections within one day.\nThis increases the number to almost 64.000 throughout the country. In Hubei, only 116 patients died of the disease, as the provincial Health Commission reports on state television. This causes almost 1400-year-old deaths throughout the country. Experts, however, also look at the new figures with caution and fear a high dark number.\nThe newly submitted statistics also caused confusion at first. According to its own information, the National Health Commission deducted cases from the previous day from the national aggregate statistics because it counted Hubei figures twice. The day before yesterday there had been excitement because the number of newly confirmed infections had increased dramatically by 15.000. The reason was the new counting method, which also included the clinical diagnoses of the Covid-19 lung disease mentioned in recent weeks.\nBecause the DNA tests in the laboratory often fail to detect the infection, cases of pneumonia, fever, respiratory problems and other typical Covid-19 symptoms are now also included, and therefore a diagnosis of the infection can be made without a laboratory test.\nIn the 4823 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus mentioned on Friday in Hubei, 3095 such cases with only clinical diagnosis were also included, as reported by the Provincial Health Commission. However, the new census is only applied in Hubei, not in the rest of the country. This will allow patients to be treated more appropriately and prevent further spread of the virus more effectively.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) welcomed the new approacYeah. It allows people in Hubei to be isolated and treated more quickly and allows contact persons to be observed earlier. As hospitals in Hubei and their medical staff are completely overwhelmed by the high number of patients, more than 21.000 medical professionals from other parts of the country have already been sent to the crisis region, as Xinhua News Agency reported.\nWith the return wave of tens of millions of Chinese returning to their jobs after the extended New Year holidays due to the epidemic, concerns are growing about the further spread of the virus. According to Chinese press reports, an infection was detected in a member of the cleaning staff on a high-speed train, which raised concerns about infections on the train.\nOutside mainland China, more than two dozen countries around 580 are confirmed, most in Japan. There was an accumulation of more than 200 cases on the cruise ship "Diamond Princess" located outside Yokohama. Asian countries are therefore reluctant to allow cruise ships to enter their ports. For example, the Aidavita, with around 1100 passengers mostly from Germany and 400 crew members, could not start as planned in Vietnam. The shipping company insisted there were no virus outbreaks on board. Nor did the ship enter a Chinese port.\nIn Germany 16 infections have been detected. The first patient was able to leave a Bavarian clinic on Thursday as cured. In Bavaria, 13-infected people are still being treated, all of them related to the car supplier Webasto. A Chinese employee had planted the virus there. Two infected Wuhan returnees are also housed in the Frankfurt University Clinic, a clinic spokesman said.\nIn addition to the infected, more than 100 people are under quarantine in GermanyYeah. At present 122 people are staying in a barracks in the Palatinate Germersheim, which had been taken from the heavily afflicted Chinese city of Wuhan in early February. When her quarantine is lifted, it will be decided on Sunday. In Berlin, around 20-more Wuhan returnees are isolated. A second test had also shown no infections.\nThe consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak for Germany are difficult to estimate. "We are currently unable to predict the dynamics of the outbreak," said the president of Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lothar Wieler, on Thursday in Berlin. Virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite said the pathogen Sars-CoV-2 multiplies like the flu virus in the throat, making it more contagious than initially suspected. Everyone should learn about the disease and ask themselves, for example, how people with basic family diseases can be protected.\nIn China, the statistical death rate is approximately two percent, except for 0.2 percent, said Wieler. Special risk groups are elderly patients. (dpa'

'888888,0,TOKYO (AFP) - A state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping this spring has been postponed, as preventing the outbreak of the new coronavirus is “the biggest challenge” for the two countries, Japan’s top government spokesman said on Thursday (March 5). \n "A state visit by President Xi to Japan will be held at a convenient time for both of us," chief Cabinet secretary\xa0Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo.\xa0“The biggest challenge now for both countries is the prevention of the spread of the new coronavirus. It is necessary to give first priority to this.” \n Mr Xi had been expected to make the state visit in the spring after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe formally invited him during last year’s Group of 20 summit in Osaka.\xa0The last state visit by a Chinese president to Japan was in 2008, and Mr Xi’s trip was cast as a key sign of warming bilateral ties. \n The coronavirus outbreak, however, has delayed the visit. \n “China and Japan are both currently fully fighting the NCP (novel coronavirus pneumonia) epidemic,” Mr Zhao Lijian, foreign ministry spokesman, told a news conference in Beijing.\xa0“Both sides agreed on the necessity of ensuring that Chairman Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan takes place at the most appropriate timing, environment and atmosphere, and achieves full success.” \n Japanese officials had in recent weeks insisted that the trip was on despite the spread of the virus. \n “A visit to Japan by a Chinese president is once-in-a-decade event,” Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said last week.\xa0“It is important that we will make sure that it will be something that will result in full achievements,” he added, in comments seen at the time as suggesting the trip could be delayed. \n The virus has infected more than 95,000 people worldwide and killed over 3,200.\xa0 \n The postponement came as Japan steps up its response to the epidemic, which has infected at least 317 people and been linked to six deaths domestically.\xa0Tokyo has faced criticism for acting slowly when the outbreak began and for its handling of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where more than 700 people contracted the virus. \n On Thursday, the Yomiuri daily reported that Japan will quarantine all arrivals from China and South Korea for two weeks, without specifying when the measures were expected to take effect.\xa0In an exclusive, the paper said Chinese and Korean tourists would be asked not to visit Japan, and visas would be suspended.\xa0The Yomiuri said the measures would be announced by Mr Abe later on Thursday. \n Relations between Asia’s two biggest economies have warmed in recent years after suffering in 2012 when Tokyo “nationalised” disputed islands claimed by Beijing. \n Mr Abe visited Beijing in 2018 – the first official visit by a Japanese prime minister since 2011.\xa0He also visited China last December to hold talks with South Korea’s Mr Moon Jae-in and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at a trilateral summit. During his stay in China, Mr Abe separately met Mr Xi. \n Last June, Mr Abe met Mr Xi on the sidelines of the G-20 summit and invited him for a state visit.\xa0“I want to enhance Japan-China relations... by welcoming President Xi Jinping to Japan during cherry blossom next year,” Mr Abe said at the time. \n The world’s second- and third-largest economies have a fraught relationship, complicated by longstanding maritime disputes and Japan’s wartime legacy.\xa0The thaw has accelerated in recent months as both countries face trade battles with United States President Donald Trump. \n '

'888888,0,GENEVA - A World Health Organisation panel of experts on the new coronavirus met on Thursday to evaluate whether the outbreak, which has spread from China to several countries, constitutes an international emergency.  \n The 16 independent experts in disease control, virology, epidemiology and vaccine development were holding a second closed-door meeting at the U.N. agency\'s headquarters in Geneva after not reaching a decision on Wednesday.  \n Didier Houssin, an adviser to France\'s national health security agency, is serving as chair. Chinese health authorities made a presentation by teleconference and have allowed a WHO team into the country who are due to report back to the panel.  \n A news conference was expected later in the day.  \n Here are some facts about WHO Emergency Committees:  \n  \n - Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Monday that the WHO had called an Emergency Committee to assess the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year.  \n  \n - Declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern - known as a "PHEIC" in WHO jargon - is rare.  \n  \n - The WHO panel\'s recommendations, after assessing any evidence of human-to-human transmission and other factors, would be put to Tedros, who would decide whether to declare an emergency.  \n  \n - Only five emergencies have been declared in the past decade: the H1 virus that caused an influenza pandemic (2009), West Africa\'s Ebola outbreak, polio (2014), Zika virus (2016), and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019).  \n  \n - The WHO\'s criteria, laid out in the 2005 International Health Regulations, define a PHEIC as "an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"\n.  \n  \n - Such situations are "serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected", carry cross-border implications and may require immediate international action, its rules say.  \n  \n - A declaration would lead to boosting public health measures, funding and resources to prevent and reduce international spread.  \n  \n - It could include recommendations on trade and travel, including airport screening of passengers, although the WHO generally aims to avoid disruptive trade restrictions.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two planes with about 300 passengers, mostly U.S. citizens, took off from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday bound for the United States — the third group of evacuees from the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. State Department said.\nOne of the flights had room to accommodate more than 60 Canadians, who will disembark on a stopover in Vancouver, British Columbia, before the remaining passengers continue on to the United States, a State Department spokeswoman told Reuters.\nThe plane stopping in Vancouver will fly on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in Southern California, the Pentagon said in a separate statement.\nThe second aircraft is headed for Omaha, Nebraska, by way of Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, following a refueling stop in California, the Defense Department said. Both planes are due to arrive on Friday.\nThe Defense Department has set aside surplus housing at each of those and a handful of other U.S. bases as quarantine sites for American evacuees arriving from Wuhan or the surrounding province of Hubei, where the coronavirus originated.\nThe first evacuation flight from Wuhan, carrying 195 State Department employees, their family members and other Americans, arrived Jan. 29 at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles.\nAnother group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from Wuhan arrived on Wednesday aboard two cargo jets - 178 of them taken to Travis Air Force Base in northern California and 167 others to Miramar near San Diego.\nFollowing the same procedures of previous flights, the latest wave of evacuees will be met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening and will be placed under quarantine for 14 days, the extent of the incubation period for the coronavirus, the Pentagon said\n.\nAny who show signs of illness will likely be hospitalized in isolation off base, as have a total of at least six passengers who exhibited fever, cough or other possible symptoms of the disease upon their arrival at Travis and Miramar.\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 30,000 people and killed at least 600, most in and around Wuhan.\nThe CDC has said the risk of widespread transmission of the disease in the United States remains very low, but the Trump administration last week declared a U.S. public health emergency to ensure containment of the virus.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. All but two of the patients were infected while traveling to China. Just two cases are known to have been transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both spouses of individuals who were infected abroad.\nStarting this week, the U.S. government has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently been in China.\nThe CDC also has ordered mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited China’s Hubei Province, while Americans who were elsewhere in mainland China are subject to 14 days of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China are being directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers are screened by the CDC.\n'

"I also think it is important that we sort this out in such a way that we can then also take the necessary rest."\nSpain praised the information policy of the Chinese government. Unlike the major Sars epidemic, which killed hundreds of people in China seventeen years ago, the international community\'s exchange works and China is also more transparent than it was a few years ago. It is therefore better to prepare for this. Spahn said it was important to classify the disease and pointed out the flu that killed around 20000 people every year in Germany. "This is also a risk that we have every day." In the new lung disease, the incidence of infection is milder compared to this.\nAccording to Chinese authorities on Friday, another patient died outside the particularly affected province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, and the death was reported in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. The day before yesterday, a death had already become known in the northern province of Hebei.\nMost of the victims were elderly people with pre-existing illnesses.

'888888,0,As of March 28, less than three months after the world was made aware of the novel coronavirus, 600,000 people across 177 countries/regions have been infected with it. The infection which reportedly originated from a market in Wuhan city in the Chinese province of Hubei, has claimed more than 27,800 lives.\nWith nations entering lockdown in an effort to \'flatten the curve\' of social interactions by means of social distancing, it is very important to refrain from placing one\'s beliefs in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Here are some widely shared myths about the novel coronavirus that stand nowhere on the scale of scientific relevance.\nThis is a myth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that this infection can be transmitted in any and all areas regardless of climate.\nThis is not true. While wearing a mask in a crowded place is advisable, the mask cannot prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. In some cases where the person wearing the mask touches an infected surface before touching his/her face to re-adjust the mask, this protective gear could lead to infection, said the Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria.\nThis is a myth. The normal body temperature remains stable between 36.5°C to 37°C despite the temperature of one\'s bath, says the WHO.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to prove this claim. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a recommended precaution against any virus, drinking alcohol while seeking to cure Covid-19 is the same as drinking alcohol-based hand sanitizer and expecting it to taste like a pint of beer.\nIt has been established that the novel coronavirus jumped species from an animal to a man and is originally a zoonotic disease. However, no known animal species has been known to carry this virus as of yet and medical experts have asked people not to believe in rumours and eat non-vegetarian meals as long as they are prepared with utmost care for hygiene.\nThis is a myth. Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel coronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but it does not in any way mean that they are infected.\nDirector of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria says that one should not visit a hospital during a pandemic since it increases the chances of a healthy person catching the virus. One should consult a doctor over the phone if he/she is experiencing any symptoms at all and seek future course of action.\nThis is a myth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the consumption of garlic boosts the immunity system or safeguards one from being infected with Covid-19.\nThis is untrue. One should not donate blood at a time like this unless and until one is absolutely sure that he/she is not infected.\nThis is a myth. No study or research has shown that mosquitoes can act as carriers of the novel coronavirus. "The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose," says WHO.\nThese are myths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one should regularly wash one\'s hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Apart from this, neither a hand dryer nor an ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virus.\nThis is a myth. Pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine cannot protect anyone from Covid-19 since the vaccine for the new coronavirus is yet to be discovered.\nThis is untrue. While some preliminary research has shown that the novel coronavirus remains on certain surfaces such as cardboard for some time, it cannot spread through parcels received from China.\nThis is not entirely true. A thermal scanner detects body temperature and is great for identifying someone with a high fever, however, medical experts and doctors treating Covid-19 patients have said that initial research shows how people who display no symptoms can also be infected with the virus.\nThis is untrue. The transmission of novel coronavirus has been seen in people of all ages. Doctors suggest that people with co-morbid conditions such as blood pressure, heart or respiratory diseases are at a higher risk if they get infected with Covid-19. However, a perfectly healthy person can also be infected in the presence of a Covid-19 patient.\n'

'888888,0,BENGALURU/NEW DELHI - India, the world\'s main supplier of generic drugs, has restricted the export of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them, including Paracetamol, a common pain reliever also sold as acetaminophen, as the coronavirus outbreak plays havoc with supply chains.  \n The Indian government urged calm and said there were enough stocks to manufacture formulations for two-to-three months.  \n The government\'s list of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and medicines accounts for 10% of all Indian pharmaceutical exports and includes several antibiotics, such as tinidazole and erythromycin, the hormone progesterone and Vitamin B12.  \n It was unclear how the restriction would impact the availability of these medicines in the countries that import from India and also depend on China. In the United States, for instance, Indian imports accounted for 24 percent of medicines and 31 percent of medicine ingredients in 2018, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \n FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told U.S. senators on Tuesday that the agency is working to determine how the restrictions will affect the U.S. medical supply and the effect on essential medicines.  \n The FDA last week announced the first coronavirus-related drug shortage in the United States but declined to name the drug in question. Hahn said on Tuesday that drug was in shortage because of a lack of materials needed to make the API.  \n Indian drugmakers rely on China, the source of the virus outbreak, for almost 70% of the APIs for their medicines. Industry experts say they are likely to face shortages if the epidemic drags on.  \n "Export of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs... is hereby \'restricted\' with immediate effect and till further orders," the Director General of Foreign Trade said in a statement https://dgft.gov.in/sites/default/files/Noti%2050_0.pdf on Tuesday, without explaining the extent of the restrictions.  \n "Irrespective of the ban, some of these molecules may face shortages for the next couple of months," Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, told Reuters. The council falls under the federal commerce ministry.  \n "If coronavirus is not contained, then in that case there could be acute shortages," Dua said.  \n In a statement, the Indian federal government said state authorities had been asked to monitor the production and availability of APIs and formulations to prevent black marketing and hoarding.  \n U.S. drugmakers have said they are monitoring their supply chains and Mylan NV <MYL.O> warned last week that there could be drug shortages. Eli Lilly and Co <LLY.N> said on Tuesday it does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to result in shortages for any of its therapies, including insulin products.  \n  \n INDIA MONITORING PATIENTS  \n Separately, the Indian government said on Tuesday it had detected "high viral load" in six people who had been in contact with a patient who contracted the virus in New Delhi, the capital.  \n The patient in New Delhi was being monitored and was stable, the government said.  \n The six people have been kept in isolation and their samples are being sent to India\'s National Institute of Virology for confirmation, the government said in a statement https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1604938.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to quell public fears.  \n "There is no need to panic," he said in a tweet.  \n "Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus.

'888888,0,GENEVA • The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that vaccines for the new coronavirus could be available in 18 months, as it warned that the virus could create havoc in countries with weaker public health systems. \n The disease now has the official name Covid-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a media briefing in Geneva on Tuesday. \n Under the guidelines of the WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health, and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the name for the disease has to avoid references to a geographic location, an animal, an individual or group of people, Dr Tedros said. \n "Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. \n "It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks," he added. \n Despite the ongoing global research effort, the WHO chief estimated that it could take 18 months for the first Covid-19 vaccines to be ready. \n While reiterating that now is a window of opportunity to fight the disease as most of the cases have so far remained in China, Dr Tedros also expressed his concerns that the virus could spread to countries with weaker public health systems and create havoc. \n He said all countries should be "as aggressive as possible" and not allow the virus space for regional transmission. \n At Tuesday\'s briefing, the WHO also announced that it will initiate a United Nations crisis management team against the virus, bringing in other UN agencies. \n To fast-track global research on the disease, the WHO coordinated a two-day research and innovation forum in Geneva from Tuesday which gathered about 400 scientists and researchers, as well as 25 funders, to discuss a priority research agenda. \n WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the forum was fortunate to have doctors from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to present online research data already initiated in China.

'888888,0,BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported 46 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, while the city of Wuhan, the pandemic’s ground zero, announced it would be loosening a two-month lockdown by gradually resuming public transportation and allowing healthy people to resume work.\nIt was the fourth day in a row with an increase in Chinese cases, all but one of which was imported from overseas.\nBut in a sign of easing lockdown measures, residents living in and outside Wuhan will be allowed to travel into the city to resume work if they have a green health code issued by the government and normal body temperature, state-media CCTV News reported on Sunday. It cited the city’s epidemic prevention and control command center.\nNon-local people stranded in Wuhan can also apply to leave the city after taking an RNA test and receiving a health certificate from the government, the channel said.\nDespite the relaxed measures for Wuhan and a reduced number of domestically transmitted cases — the one reported on Sunday was the first in four days — China is seeing a steady rise in imported cases, mostly Chinese people returning from overseas.  That has led Beijing to further step up measures to intercept cases from abroad as the outbreak worsens globally.\nIn a sign of how seriously China is taking the threat of imported cases, all international flights due to arrive in Beijing starting Monday will first land at another airport, where passengers will undergo virus screening, government agencies said on Sunday, in an expansion of existing measures.\nInternational flights that were scheduled to arrive in the capital will land instead at one of 12 airports. Passengers who clear screening will then be permitted to reboard the plane, which will then fly to Beijing, the regulator said.\nSeparately, Shanghai and Guangzhou both announced that all arriving international passengers will undergo an RNA test to screen for coronavirus, expanding a program that previously only applied to those coming from heavily-hit countries.\nAmong the new cases from abroad reported on Sunday, a record 14 were in the financial hub of Shanghai and 13 were in Beijing, a decline from 21 the previous day.\nThe new locally transmitted case was in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou and was also the first known case where the infection of a local person was linked to the arrival of someone from overseas, according to Guangdong province.\nHu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper, called for all cities in China to implement 14-day quarantines for people arriving from abroad.\nHe also called for quarantine policies to apply to people from Hong Kong and Macau as well, he said on his Weibo account on Sunday.\n“I am worried that there are similar cases to the Guangzhou one existing in other parts of the country. There were reports previously that people coming back from abroad returned to their homes in Shanghai without any obstacles,” Hu said.\n“It matters to the overall situation of China’s next prevention and control efforts if we can plug the leaks.”\nThe Global Times is a tabloid published by the Ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily.\nThe latest figures from China’s National Health Commission bring total reported coronavirus cases in the country to 81,054, with 3,261 deaths, including six on Saturday. On Saturday, China reported 41 new coronavirus cases for the previous day, all of them imported.\nOf all 97 imported cases as of end-Saturday, 92 of them are Chinese nationals and 51 are Chinese students returning from studying abroad, said Gao Xiaojun, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Health Commission during a press conference on Sunday.\nThe Beijing health commission announced separately on its website it had two more imported cases on Sunday, bringing the city’s total number of imported cases to 99 as of Sunday noon.\nChina is trying to revive an economy that is widely expected to contract deeply in the current quarter, with life slowly returning to normal in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, albeit with everyone wearing masks in public.\nStill, numerous shops and restaurants remain shut - many have gone out of business - and factories and other workplaces are still not operating at full capacity.\nOn Sunday, a central bank official called for stepped-up global policy coordination to manage the economic impact of the pandemic. He said China’s recent policy measures were gaining traction, and it has capacity for further action.\nChen Yulu, a deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), also said he expects significant improvement in the Chinese economy in the second quarter.\nAnd while the virus will continue putting upward pressure on near-term consumer prices, there is no basis for long-term inflation or deflation, he told a news briefing.\nGlobally, roughly 275,000 people have been infected with the virus, and more than 11,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally, with the number of deaths in Italy recently surpassing those in China.\n“Now I think the epidemic has been controlled. But this definitely doesn’t mean that it’s over,” said a 25-year-old woman surnamed He who works in the internet sector and was visiting the vast Summer Palace complex in Beijing on Saturday.\n“I’m willing to come out today but of course I am still afraid,” she told Reuters.\nThe central province of Hubei, where the outbreak first emerged late last year in its capital Wuhan, reported its fourth straight day of no new cases.\nChina has used draconian measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down Hubei province.\n'

Recent data has largely shown the U.S. economy continuing to expand at a moderate pace, and the Fed has signaled that its monetary policy stance is unlikely to change this year.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: U.S. Unemployment vs S&P index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1610/1585/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 5/RETURN OF VOLMAGEDDON  \n When a slight U.S. inflation uptick pushed stock markets lower on Feb. 5 two years ago, few expected it to turn into one of the biggest Wall Street shake-ups in recent years. That episode -- "Volmageddon" -- saw the VIX equity volatility gauge triple overnight to 50%, wiping out hordes of small punters who had piled into so-called inverse-vol investments.  \n These strategies, peddled via exchange-traded products and designed to profit from extended spells of market calm, yielded rich pickings as long as volatility stayed low. But as the VIX exploded higher, vehicles such as the ProShares Short VIX ETF tumbled over 80 percent in a day.  \n As we were reminded two years ago, volatility can spike spectacularly in quiet markets. As it happens, the coronavirus has sent the VIX to three-month highs and ProShares ETF, which had climbed back to the highest level reached since Volmageddon, has fallen again. But volatility gauges for bonds and currencies remain well below historic averages\n.

'888888,0,(Reuters) - International alarm over the coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December is driven by its rapid spread and the fact that infectious disease experts cannot yet know how deadly or contagious it is.\nWithin weeks, the virus has infected nearly 8,000 people in China and killed 170.\nClose to 100 cases have been confirmed in other countries, from Japan to the United States. On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency.\nStatistics from China indicate that just over 2% of people known to be infected with the virus have died, suggesting that it may be less deadly than the coronaviruses behind Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nBut disease experts caution that it will take several more weeks to be confident of how the new virus behaves given how quickly it has spread and the fact that a reliable diagnostic test has only recently been introduced.\n“Not everybody is being seen, not everybody is being tested,”\xa0Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters.\n“All the experts, myself included, tell the public that there is much we don’t know about this virus and we are learning as we go along. That is not so reassuring.”\nSome experts question whether the new virus shares similarities with seasonal flu, which has a low mortality rate but infects so many people that more than half a million may die from it each year, according to global health estimates.\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus here\nThe latest statistics indicate a fatality rate of about 2.2%, but the actual rate may be higher or lower as there are likely more unconfirmed cases, he said.\nThe SARS virus killed about 10% of all infected individuals, while the MERS outbreak identified in 2012 had a fatality rate of around 35%\n.\nIn emerging infectious disease outbreaks, the most serious cases are identified first. Coronavirus infections can range from mild cold-like symptoms to severe cases that cause pneumonia, acute respiratory illness and death.\nAbout 20% of confirmed cases in the China coronavirus outbreak are classified as severe, similar to SARS and MERS, Schaffner said.\nGRAPHIC: Online package of China virus news here\nThe previously unknown strain is believed to have originated late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan.\nWithin weeks it appeared capable of being transmitted from one person to another via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n“The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than SARS,” said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain’s University of Nottingham.\nThe incubation period is estimated between one and 14 days, and there have been anecdotal accounts of “symptomless spreading” by someone who is infected but unaware of it.\nNeil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London, says that is too early to know if so-called “super-spreader” events seen with MERS and SARS is happening with the new coronavirus.\nSome 60 million people are under virtual lockdown in China’s Hubei province – of which Wuhan is the capital. Australia, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Indonesia are quarantining evacuees from China for at least two weeks.\nMany global airlines have suspended or scaled back direct flights to China’s major cities.\nExperts say China has been more forthcoming with information than it was during its 2003 SARS outbreak, but there are still concerns about how much data they are sharing.\nSome also questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine attempt on millions of people.\n“That kind of thing can backfire. It can make it harder to get resources in,” said Dr\n. Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.\n'

'888888,0,As the world grapples to come to terms with the growing threat of the novel Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has chosen to direct his anger at neighbours China.

This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

They have put the world at stake. I really don’t understand how can you eat bats, dogs, and cats. I’m really angry.\n"The whole world is at risk now. The tourism industry has been hit, the economy is badly affected, and the whole world is going towards a lockdown," Akhtar said.\nPossibly fearing a backlash, Akhtar then went on to clarify that he was not against "the people of China" but the "law of animals".\n"I’m not against the people of China but I’m against the law of animals. I understand this may be your culture but this is not benefitting you now, it is killing humanity. I’m not saying you boycott the Chinese but there has to be some law. You cannot go on an eat anything and everything," Akhtar added.\nAkhtar also seemed pretty disappointed by the empty stadiums currently serving as venues for Pakistan Super League matches, which arrived in the country for the 1st time since its inception.\n"The biggest reason for anger is PSL Cricket returned to Pakistan after so many years, the PSL was happening in our country for the first time now even that is at risk.

'888888,0,Liu Hongshen, a Chinese doctor who once worked in the Moscow football club, introduced the situation of ganavirus to Talas barabashi, a Russian News Agency reporter. He believes that Europe will have to move by 2020 and gives Russians advice on how to protect themselves from disease.\n-Dr Liu, is it right that the European Football League has suspended the game? Champions League, European Union, national hockey and NBA championships are suspended. "Here comes tennis, too."\n-It is necessary for the health of the fans. God bless, if someone gets sick in the stands, then everyone will be infected. The virus spreads very quickly, from one person to another. So I think it\'s the right decision to suspend the game.\n-It is expected that the Russian football league will be suspended soon, while the Korean Ice Hockey League has been suspended. Isn\'t that cool? You can play without an audience.\n-I think these games can continue in Russia on the condition that they are played without an audience. You know, the message from China is: older people are more likely to get the virus. Football players and ice hockey players - healthy young people who have good immunity. In these people, there are very few diseasesAbout I think the Russian football championships and the Korean Ice Hockey Championships can continue without an audience.\n-European Football Championships will be held in 12 cities in the summer. Someone said he was a threat in Colorado. Nor can we rule out the possibility that some countries, including Italy, have to give up the game. In this case, part of the game can be made up to Russia. On the one hand, it\'s great, but we can see foreign fans. What should I do?\n-If this is still the case, the European Football Championship will have to be rescheduled. It\'s unrealistic to get fans from Europe to Russia. Obviously, the transfer of the European Cup in 2020 will bring huge financial loss to people, but I think it will still suffer the loss of the European Championship. The game is going to be late.\n-How to say, why on earth did Russia come from your country?\nI want to correct you. This is not a Chinese virus. This is not Wuhan virus. Now it is said that the virus is taken away by people from the United States. Zhao Lijiang, a spokesman for China\'s foreign ministry, said the same thing. That is to say, everything comes from the American troops in China.\nI can\'t say that 100% of the information is true, but it has spread in the world. I read every dayAbout It could be the economic collapse of a competitor that Americans want. I think it\'s true.\nAt the same time, I would like to say that the pattern of the virus raging in Italy is different from that in China. This is very important.\n-On March 5, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei sobianin, signed a decree establishing a high level of vigilance against new coronaviruses in the capital. According to the document, citizens from disadvantaged states in Colorado are obliged to ensure self closure at home within 14 days of their return to the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, since March 10, 2020, Moscow has banned mass gatherings involving more than 5000 people. A similar situation is in St. Petersburg. In your opinion, what measures need to be taken?\n-The government must close the border completely so that people from European countries will not fly to Russia. At present, the case of coronavirus infection in Russia is related to one of them going to Europe or European coming to Russia. The Chinese have blocked the border, and Russia should do the same. It is very important to close air traffic with Europe.\n-Rest day - the time for families to go shopping in the supermarket. Now the time in line in the store is huge. Should we go shopping?\n-As far as stores are concerned, I would like to say: limit walking to shoppingAbout It\'s better to restrict subway travel. There are many people there. If you need to buy something, go to the store. If you can stand it, you\'d better not go shopping. In a word, you should wash your hands frequently and keep your mood. I know that many people are worried and scared now. My advice is: relax and relax. Just wash your hands and, if possible, wear a protective mask on the street. This is very important.\n-Open up a Chinese secret. What needs to be done to minimize the risk of pollution?\nAccording to the news I got from China, eat ginger and drink it in tea. It\'s very helpful. Ginger boils and drinks its soup every day. Twice a day. It will certainly help you recover and never get sick again.\nThere are doubts about the possibility of infection. "People who die of flu die every year," they say Do you have anything to refute?\n-Coronavirus is not as terrible as many other viruses. It\'s just that the world is suffering from unnecessary information about the virus. Ganarius made unnecessary advertisements. Information comes from the world of China. I know that many people think that China\'s economy will end with information about Colorado, but you see what\'s happening in Europe now. And in China, people are recoverinAbout There is no calculation of who launched all the information. If everyone knew that the virus would spread all over the world, those who promoted it would remain silent. Look, how many old people die of flu and cold every year, complications. No one noticed. Television and the Internet now, of course, scream more than we need.\nWe know a lot of American movies that give us images of the end of the world because of various virus infections. There\'s even a direction for apocalyptic movies. In theory, can Colorado virus lead to human extinction?\n-Everything will be OK, because in China people are already treating diseases. There are now new cases in China, but no one has died. It can cure coronavirus. Remember, everyone is talking about AIDS? However, people have forgotten him, and human beings continue to live. This is a very good person'

"888888,0,LONDON (Reuters) - European airlines stepped up their warnings over the coronavirus outbreak on Friday, with British Airways-owner IAG and Finnair flagging a hit to profits and easyJet reporting a big drop in demand into and out of a virus-affected region in Italy.\nAll three airlines also joined rivals in announcing cost cuts to help weather a storm of unknown severity and duration.\nA new coronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel plunging in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world, raising fears of a pandemic that could plunge the global economy into recession.\nIAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year, but said the ongoing uncertainty over the impact and duration of the outbreak meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.\nHowever, it warned: “We are currently experiencing demand weakness on Asian and European routes and a weakening of business travel across our network resulting from the cancellation of industry events and corporate travel restrictions.”\nBritish Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nLower air traffic growth projections prompted Spanish travel technology firm Amadeus (AMA.MC) to forecast slower 2020 core profit growth on Friday, but it stressed the outlook did not yet account for the uncertain impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nTo deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM (AIRF.PA) which have announced similar plans.\nIt also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.\nAirline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a stock market rout this week as coronavirus fears have gripped investors. At 0845 GMT, IAG shares were down 8% at 474.59 pence, while easyJet (EZJ.L) stock was down 3% at 1,075 pence and Finnair (FIA1S.HE) was off 3.4% at 4.922 euros.\n(Graphic: Europe's Airlines - here)\nBudget carrier EasyJet reported a “significant” softening of demand into and out of its bases in northern Italy - the center of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in Europe - and a reduction across its other European markets.\nIt also said it would be cancelling some flights, particularly into and out of Italy, and that it would make cost savings across its business, without giving details.\n“We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,” it said, adding it was too early to determine the impact on its results.\nFinnair, meanwhile, warned of a “significant” fall in operating profit this year due to virus-related disruption.\nFinland’s national airline also said its was scrapping its 2020 capacity growth target, and would look into cutting costs by 40-50 million euros ($44-54 million), with measures under consideration including temporary layoffs.\n"

'888888,0,It is tough to avoid a global economic fallout when governments around the world are trying their best to contain raging novel coronavirus pandemic.\nMore than 1,30,000 confirmed cases have been reported while the virus has claimed over 4,500 lives. In such a scenario, a government is almost entirely focused on ways to protect citizens.\nSome hard decisions that are likely to have a long-term effect on the global economy have been taken by governments of affected nations in order to protect citizens.\nSimply put, governments have had to pass orders stopping important economic activity including tourism, trade and manufacturing, production and much more.\nThough it is not possible at the moment to calculate the total economic damage caused by Covid-19, it will have significant economic fallout, many noted experts, including International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist Gita Gopinath, have said.\nADAPT, OVERCOME\nGopinath recently wrote a blog where she mentioned that the world has suffered due to the virus, especially due to shocks in supply and demand stemming from the health crisis.\nShe goes on to say that substantial targeted policies are needed to back the economy during the course of an epidemic.\nGopinath also explains that while businesses and firms around the globe cannot escape unharmed, they should be ready to double-up and recover once the outbreak fades.\n"The goal is to prevent a temporary crisis from permanently harming people and firms through job losses and bankruptcies," she wrote.\nSince there is no vaccine to contain the virus, countries have resorted to measures like travel restrictions, temporary school closures and quarantines. Gopinath said such measures can work well during the crisis and put less economic pressure on the existing health systems.\nECONOMIC IMPACT\nThe financial impact of novel coronavirus pandemic, though cannot be determined by any single economic indicator, has been widespread. The financial distress caused to China, the worst affected country that is slowly recovering, has been the biggest blow to the world.\nSeveral parts of China, which is considered the world\'s manufacturing hub, were put under strict restrictions when the outbreak was just identified.\nWithin a month, the death toll and the number of infected people shot up sharply. The Chinese government was forced to lock down factories, prominent stores and other brands. It led to huge economic losses around the world and was reflected in stock markets around the globe, especially Asian countries.\nMany reports predicted that global GDP would take a massive hit as lockdown in China would lead to large-scale supply disruptions.\n"The economic impact is already visible in the countries most affected by the outbreak. For example, in China, manufacturing and service sector activity declined dramatically in February. While the drop in manufacturing is comparable to the start of the global financial crisis, the decline in services appears larger this time-reflecting the large impact of social distancing," Gopinath explained.\nIn her blogpost, the IMF chief economist warned about the financial effects and spillovers due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There could be a rise in borrowing costs and financial conditions could also tighten.\nSince most countries around the world will face economic shock at the same time, the economic impact of the virus could take a turn for the worse.\nHOW TO LIMIT FALLOUT\nWhile it is not possible to completely avoid the economic fallout caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the IMF chief economist said targeted economic policies will be needed to shore up economies after the outbreak fades.\n"Considering that the economic fallout reflects particularly acute shocks in specific sectors, policymakers will need to implement substantial targeted fiscal, monetary, and financial market measures to help affected households and businesses," Gopinath opined.\nShe goes on to say that households and businesses hit by supply disruptions could be "targeted to receive cash transfers, wage subsidies, and tax relief" to help them meet daily needs and sustain businesses.\nGiving an example of crisis-hit Italy, Gopinath said the country has extended tax deadlines for companies in affected areas and broadened the wage supplementation fund to provide income support to workers who have been fired due to the virus outbreak.\nKorea, meanwhile, has introduced wage subsidies for all small merchants and increased allowances for homecare and job seekers. China, for the time being, has waived social security contributions for businesses.\nGopinath said that central banks should also be ready to provide "ample liquidity" to banks and NBFCs, especially those who lend to small and medium-sized enterprises. Such enterprises are usually not prepared to deal with a health crisis of such magnitude.\n"Governments could offer temporary and targeted credit guarantees for the near-term liquidity needs of these firms. For example, Korea has expanded lending for business operations and loan guarantees for affected small- and medium-sized enterprises," she wrote\n"Financial market regulators and supervisors could also encourage, on a temporary and time-bound basis, extensions of loan maturities."\nGopinath also recommended broader monetary stimulus such as policy rate cuts or asset purchases, both of which can boost confidence and support financial markets.\nShe, however, said these broad-based fiscal relief measures, should be effective when business operations begin to normalise.\n'
'888888,0,At the moment, the machines are not standing still with the world\'s leading manufacturer of Dupont protective suits. "Since the official outbreak of the Coronavirus, there has been a strong increase in demand," said Product Manager Albrecht Gerland at the factory in the Luxembourg Contern of the German Press Agency.\nAt first, significantly more goods had been delivered to China, where the virus had broken out. With the increasing spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Europe is now increasingly at the forefront.\nContern produces the material for the protective suits. The fibrous material made of plastic is called Tyvek and is very thin and light, extremely tear-resistant and breathable. On huge rolls the fabric goes to nine seams especially in Asia, where the coats are then made. The American specialist chemical company Dupont usually produces 200 million protective suits a year. This year, because of the extreme demand, Germany said, it would be much more.\nThe disposable protective suits were mainly made by dealers to people dealing with the infected and patients: doctors, nurses and nurses. In addition, the need for authorities, policemen and customs officers who controlled people is growing. Dupont has two plants worldwide that produce the fabric for protective clothing: one in Richmond in the USA, the other in Contern in Luxembourg.\nWith the raging Coronavirus, other companies also report a rush on their products: for example, manufacturers of disinfectants or respiratory masks. However, most companies suffer from the consequences of the new virus: every second company in Germany expects a decline in sales after a survey of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) day.\nIn the Dupont factory in Luxembourg, the company runs around the clock, the employees work overtime. "The Coronavirus means an enormous amount of work and energy for our work," said plant manager Paul MeyerYeah. However, around 1200 employees were "highly motivated" to help the affected people on the ground. Contern is currently developing a new product line for 340 million euro.\nAccording to a spokesman from Dupont Germany, the demand for protective clothing is currently higher than what the company can provide. But "the best" is done. "We have changed the distribution channels to get the production volume into the crisis areas." It also means that other Tyvek products, such as envelopes or medical packaging material, would currently be produced less.\nIn addition to seven sewers in Asia, there is also one in Mexico and one in Romania for Europe, Germany said. The European market is also served by protective suits manufactured mainly in Vietnam. With the outbreak of Covid-19 in China, as much as before had been delivered to China within a week 30-fold. "Now it balances out because there are cases everywhere.'
'888888,0,The coronavirus death toll in China climbed to 2,943 with 31 more deaths, while 125 confirmed cases were reported, the lowest since the virus outbreak in the country, Chinese health officials said on Tuesday even as the deadly disease wreaked havoc globally with the total number of deaths crossing 3,000 and infections surging past 89,000.\nChina’s National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Tuesday it received reports of 125 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 31 deaths on Monday in the country.\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, there are 89,527 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3,056 deaths reported globally in 67 countries.\nIn terms of confirmed cases in China, officials said Monday\'s numbers were the lowest since the country began to report about the coronavirus epidemic, showing signs of stabilising, especially in the Chinese mainland.\nAll the deaths were in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, the officials said, adding that of the 125 new confirmed cases reported on Monday, 114 are from Hubei.\nNHC said the overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 80,151 by the end of Monday.\nThis included 2,943 people who died of the disease so far, 30,004 patients still undergoing treatment and 47,204 patients discharged after recovery, the officials said.\nIn Hubei province, the total confirmed cases climbed to 67,217 and total deaths rose to 2,834, including 2,251 in Wuhan, local health commission said.\nWuhan reported 111 confirmed cases and 24 deaths on Monday.\nA total of 2,410 patients were discharged from hospital after recovery in the province, bringing the total number of patients in the province to 36,167.\nAmong the 25,050 patients in hospitals, 5,407 were still in severe condition and another 1,186 in critical condition, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\nAll over China, 2,742 people were discharged from hospitals after recovery on Monday, while the number of severe cases decreased by 304 to 6,806.\nThe commission said that 587 people were still suspected to be infected with the virus.\nBy the end of Monday, 100 confirmed cases including two deaths had been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 41 in Taiwan, including one death.\nWith the virus spreading at a rapid pace globally, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus introduced to humans for the first time and it can be contained with the right measures.\nNoting that knowing and understanding the epidemic is the first step to defeating it, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted on Monday that "we are in unchartered territory with COVID-19. We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission."\n"It spreads from person to person mainly through the droplets produced when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes," Ghebreyesus, who visited China in January, said.\nA 12-member WHO team also visited the virus-hit areas in China and submitted a detailed report.\nGhebreyesus said containment of COVID-19 is still feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries right now, though there is no one-size-fits-all approach.\n"Our message to all countries is: this is not one-way street. We can push this coronavirus back," he said.\n"Your actions now will determine the course of the COVID-19 outbreak in your country. There\'s no choice but to act now," he said.\nWHO has been advising countries to take actions on the "first case, first cluster, first evidence of community transmission."\nMeanwhile, Ghebreyesus also deplored stigmatizing during the outbreak, which he said is "more dangerous than coronavirus itself."\n"It is painful to witness the level of stigma we are seeing. We are not angels, we are human beings, but we can do the right thing," state-run Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.\nMeanwhile, six people died of the deadly virus in the United States, while over 90 confirmed cases have been reported from the country.\nTwo people tested positive of the disease in India on Monday, including one in the national capital.\nSouth Korea reported 29 COVID-19 deaths and 477 more confirmed cases, raising the total number of infections to 4,812.\nIn Japan, the total number of infected cases increased to 980, while 12 people died of the disease.\nItaly reported a jump in the death toll to 52, with more than 2,036 people infected with the virus.\nIn Iran, the virus has claimed 66 lives, while confirmed cases climbed to more than 1,500\nThree people have died of the disease in France, while the confirmed cases increased to 191.\n'
'888888,0,SHANGHAI/TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - More than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown home to military bases in the United States, after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.  \n The cruise ship Diamond Princess, with more than 400 cases by far the largest cluster outside China, has become the biggest test so far of other countries\' ability to contain an outbreak that has killed 1,770 people in China and five elsewhere.  \n Ground crew in anti-contamination suits met a chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier. Those arriving were taken into a two-week quarantine.  \n Although U.S. officials said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be taken, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were kept in isolation on the flights.  \n Across mainland China, officials said the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 2,048 to 70,548. That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.  \n Chinese authorities say the stabilisation in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.  \n However, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared. Official figures of new cases have levelled off in the past, only to jump suddenly after changes in methodology.  \n China has responded to the COVID-19 virus by locking down Hubei\'s provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people, and imposing restrictions in a number of other cities.  \n But the ruling Communist Party is also under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and get people back to work.  \n China\'s central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending, a move that is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.  \n Even so, economists expect China\'s economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody\'s on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.  \n  \n CRUISE SHIPS  \n Around half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.  \n Several other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.  \n Matthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on the ship after refusing to board the voluntary repatriation flights, tweeted that staying behind was the "best decision ever".  \n "US Gov\'t said they would not put anyone on the planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus," he wrote.  \n Authorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.  \n One American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.  \n Carnival Corp., which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace other passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.  \n "Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information," a statement from the company\'s Holland America Line unit said. Hundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.  \n "We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health," said passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. "We have no idea when we get to get home."  \n  \n CHINA BACK TO WORK?  \n After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China needs to get back to work or suffer severe economic consequences. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.  \n Some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.  \n In Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.  \n Trade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.  \n Organisers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.  \n Japan\'s Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito\'s public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo. REUTERS \n '
'888888,0,(Reuters) - A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health issues became the United States’ first fatality from the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday, as the Trump administration stepped up efforts to combat the spread of the global outbreak.\nThe patient, who was chronically ill prior to contracting COVID-19, died at EvergreenHealth Hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department’s communicable disease unit.\nThe state has recorded two other “presumptive” coronavirus cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, he said.\n“At this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that’s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,” Duchin said.\nThe two cases at the Kirkland facility were a health care worker in her 40s who is in satisfactory condition, and a woman in her 70s who lived there and is in serious condition.\n“It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,” the state’s governor, Jay Inslee, said in a statement. “We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.”\nThe first U.S. coronavirus death capped a week of stock market upheaval and escalating concern among state and federal health officials as the virus has spread across 46 countries and infected more than 60 people in the United States.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said lawmakers would take up a coronavirus spending bill next week “to advance a strong emergency funding supplemental package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis”.\nMost of the U.S. cases have occurred in travelers who were repatriated from China, where the virus originated.\nBut public health officials have also identified coronavirus cases in California, Washington and Oregon with no direct ties to the virus’ source in China, signaling a turning point in strategies needed to contain the disease in the United States.\nU.S. health authorities say it means the respiratory disease that has infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,800 in China is no longer an imported phenomenon but has taken up residence in the United States.\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here\n“We still judge the general risk to the American public to be low and that includes residents of long-term care facilities,” Nancy Messonier, head of the Immunization and Respiratory Disease division at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told reporters in a call on Saturday.\nMessonnier said the agency would send teams to support investigations in California and Washington into how patients contracted the virus and help trace who else may have been exposed.\nReuters graphics on the new coronavirus: here\nPERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted just 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the supposed epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nHealth officials said the advent of locally transmitted infections means authorities need to expand their focus from detecting a relatively limited number of cases, identifying close contacts and isolating them, to one that also emphasizes greater prevention among the public at large.\nIn particular, individuals should be more vigilant about basic hygiene measures, such as washing hands often, avoiding touching their faces, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home from school or work whenever ill, health officials say.\nCoronavirus is spread primarily through tiny droplets coughed or sneezed directly from an infected person into the face of someone nearby, as opposed to the more contagious “airborne” transmission of a virus like measles, which can remain suspended in enclosed spaces and be breathed in hours after being exhaled by sick individuals, experts say.\nCoronavirus can also survive on surfaces, such as handrails and door knobs, for “a very long period of time,” and be picked up by hand that way, though the virus is “very susceptible” to cleaning products, Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said on Friday in Santa Clara County.\nStill, “It’s mostly a person-to-person transmission that we are concerned about for our communities,” he added.\nFor the online coverage of the coronavirus outbreak click, here\n'

"888888,0,Tass, 31 January. Molecular biologists from China and Canada analyzed the evolutionary nature of the 2019 ncov virus, which caused pneumonia in China and other countries, and concluded that this was not a single cause, These are two pathogens. The scientists' conclusions are contained in an article published by the biorxiv Electronic Science Library.\nOur analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by at least two different strains. Most likely, it began a few months ago, its presence was known, and began to formally inform the health authorities - researchers wrote.\nScientists from the University of Ottawa (Canada) and Shanghai Fudan University (China) studied two dozen small mutations in the complete 2019 ncov genome set, and came to this conclusion. Blood was extracted from patients in hospitals in Wuhan and other cities in China.\nGeneticists compared these data with RNA fragments of other coronaviruses, including SARS and mers fever in the Middle East. This allows researchers to restore the evolution tree of virus 2019 ncov and understand when common ancestors of all pathogens that exist today emerged.\nThe scientists made two unexpected discoveries\nAbout First, the virus did not appear in early or mid December, but about three or even six months ago. Secondly, biologists found a set of unique mutations in 2019 ncov samples collected in Wuhan. This clearly shows that the outbreak of this viral pneumonia has at least two puerperas.\nAt present, the researchers point out that it is not clear whether the isolation occurred before the virus began to infect the human body or after the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan. The fact that the pathogen has two different claims, they say, raises questions in itself about the theory that the city's exotic food market is the only source of the virus.\n"
'888888,0,The number of deaths caused by the new coronavirus has risen to 425, with more 64 deaths to be announced this Monday by the Hubei Provincial Health Committee, which still accounts for two.345 new cases, raising the total of Wuhan province, the city where the contagion began, to 13522. The total confirmed cases in China exceed the 17 thousand.\nAccording to data cited by Bloomberg, almost 11 thousand people are being treated in hospitals in the region at a time when Hong Kong has closed more entrances to China and Brazil has raised the alert level with regard to the new coronavirus, moving to a state of emergency in public health, to facilitate the repatriation of Brazilians in the Chinese city of Wuhan, even if there is no case.\nThis Monday, a team of researchers pointed out that the virus will originate in bats, which may harbor numerous types of diseases. Peter Daszak, an ecologist of the EcoHealth Alliance, claims to the news agency that rapid human expansion makes it ever closer to virus-bearing animals, and that bats bear the greatest responsibility for mammalian-related viruses.\nThis Sunday was the first infected mortal victim outside China, Philippines: a 44-year-old Chinese native of Wuhan.\nAlso on Sunday, a plane from the Portuguese Air Force transported to Lisbon a group of twenty people, 18 Portuguese and two Brazilian citizens, taken from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the focus of the new coronavirus.\nIn the C-130 transport plane of the Portuguese Air Force, the people who decided to leave Wuhan were accompanied by eight crew members and eight health professionals, including an international health team. In addition to mainland China and Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more cases of confirmed infection in 24 countries\nYeah.\nThe WHO declared on Thursday an international public health emergency (PHEIC) because of the outbreak of the new coronavirus in China.\nThe Ministry of Health will provide facilities where the Portuguese from Wuhan will stay in voluntary "prophylactic isolation" for four days and make analyses to avoid the new coronavirus. During this period, no visitors, even if controlled.\nThis Monday, Health Minister Marta Temido said that 20 quarantine citizens "are fine" and that the priority is to ensure comfort aspects and that there are no "health-care clinical elements to point out".\n'
'888888,1,JAKARTA/BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia is not hiding anything over the coronavirus, the health minister said on Tuesday, after some medical researchers expressed concern that cases may have gone undetected in the world’s fourth most populous country.\nWhile the virus has quickly spread from China throughout much of the rest of the region and beyond, the sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases so far.\nDozens of cases have been recorded in other regional countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, where one person has died, raising suspicions on social media in particular over a potential lack of vigilance in Indonesia.\nResearchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, then said in a study last week that Indonesia should rapidly strengthen outbreak surveillance and control - especially given that it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.\nThe Harvard team said that Indonesia’s lack of confirmed cases “may suggest the potential for undetected cases” as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China.\nThe virus has killed over 1,000, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China and 319 cases in 24 other countries. Many of the cases outside China have been in people who have a history of travelling to the country.\n“We have the kits to check coronavirus and they’re certified ... Nothing is concealed,” Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said after a cabinet meeting at the Bogor presidential palace outside Jakarta, in response to the concerns.\nIndonesia has tested 64 samples from suspected coronavirus infections - 62 of which were declared negative with two still being tested, health ministry Research and development agency head Siswanto said during a tour of its laboratory in Jakarta.\nNavaratnasamy Paranietharan, the WHO’s Indonesia representative, told a conference on Tuesday: “Indonesia has taken concrete measures and the World Health Organization is quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.”\nIndonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there.\nVivi Setiawaty, another health ministry official, said it was unclear why Indonesia had not seen any cases but said authorities were better prepared since facing H5N1 avian influenza from 2005. “We remain cautious,” she told reporters.\nIndonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the archipelago including three in Jakarta and has also quarantined more than 240 of its citizens evacuated from Hubei province, home to Wuhan, to the island of Natuna, north of Borneo.\nThe WHO’s Paranietharan said it appeared unlikely, as some have suggested, that the hot tropical climate could be a factor in curbing cases though more data would be required to be sure.\n“It doesn’t make sense at this point whether that could be the reason why we don’t have coronavirus cases in Indonesia,” Paranietharan said.\n'
'888888,0,Pulmonary doctor Filipe Froes is the representative of the Medical Association for issues related to the new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV. The coordinator of the Intensive Medical and Surgical Care Unit at Pulido Valente Hospital in Lisbon emphasises that, although much remains to be known about this virus, this outbreak must be addressed neither with alarm nor with indifference.\nThis virus surprised the world. Is he, in fact, surprising?\nNot surprising. This is a recurring phenomenon. In the last twenty years alone, the same has happened to the family of this virus twice: in 2002 with SARS-CoV and in 2012 with MERS-CoV. Cyclically, there are viruses that can cross the species barrier, that is, they come out of an animal species and can pass into the human species, causing disease. Now we have the ability to detect this more frequently and monitor it globally.\nWhat is the word on this new coronavirus?\nMost likely, the main host will be the bat and there will or will not have been an intermediate host that allowed the passage to the human being. We also know that it has a gene sequence between 70% to 80% similar to SARS-CoV. The incubation period may go up to four days, but in most patients the onset of symptoms occurred between the seventh and eighth day. Although, according to the data available, it affects more adults and males, evidence has already caused disease in all age groups.\nSo far, according to information from the Chinese authorities, between 20% to 25% of cases are associated with pneumonia and between 10% to 15% linked to respiratory distress syndrome. What characterizes these clinical charts? According to data published in "The Lancet", a large majority have a high fever followed by a dry coughYeah. Some patients develop into shortness of breath and other respiratory difficulties. There is a small percentage of patients who may have diarrhoea, but it is lower than that found in other outbreaks such as MERS-CoV.\nWe do not yet know much information or whether this applies to different populations in China. We have found that there are only mortality and serious cases in China. So far, none of the cases in Europe, the USA and Canada are serious and no one has died. SARS-CoV had a 10% mortality rate, which is very significant. So far, the new coronavirus is either 3 or 4%.\nMost of the coronavirus strains circulate between animals and never infect humans. I wonder what happened here.\nWhat is normal in nature has happened: there was a virus that managed to find a key to connecting to a human recipient. If there are situations of close proximity to animals, probably diseased animals, this will allow the inhalation of a large viral load from the animal to the human and conditions for the virus to replicate. As it is a completely new virus for humans, it has the ability to trigger diseases.\nThe virulence associated with diversity between animal species makes the virus, at least at the beginning, more difficult to transmit between humans. As it adapts, it transmits more, but it loses some characteristics that differentiate it from the virus that had [initially] infected humans. Generally, the process of adapting a virus that passes from the animal world to humans goes this way. But there is always unpredictability and its evolution can only be documented in the end. At the moment, we are dealing with a situation of unpredictability in the evolution of the new coronavirus.\nWhat are the reasons for this outbreak in China?\nChina has a huge size and represents a huge population share with different population groupYeah. Food habits include the ingestion of many different animals and markets where live animals can be sold and purchased. All this provides for situations of greater proximity and risk of exposure that do not occur in other countries.\nHow is transmission between humans taking place?\nIt is now confirmed that there is effective transmission between humans and that in some cases this happened before people showed symptoms.\nWhat cells does it affect?\nThe cells in the respiratory system. The main binding element to enter the cells is probably a receptor called ACE2, which is a more prevalent receptor in the lower respiratory tract. This may explain the largest number of cases of pneumonias and serious forms that may occur (but with less ease of transmission). But we don\'t know if there\'ll be another receiver. If there is to be easier transmission, more complaints on the upper airways and less serious cases, there has to be another type of receiver, or else all this happens in people with a higher proportion of ACE2 on the upper airways.\nIs this virus really more infectious than SARS-CoV?\nAt the moment, I\'m not sure we have the knowledge to say that. We do not yet know the actual number of infected people or the whole scale of the problem in China. With regard to the number of cases in China, there are a few significant cases in Europe, the USA or Canada. If it were too infectious, what happened to SARS-CoV in these countries would be predictable, when there was a huge outbreak in Canada.\nAt what stage can it be more contagious?\nIt\'s probably somewhere between the tenth and 12th day. More or less, this will take place two to four days after complaints have been lodged.\nAre there people who may be more capable of contagion?\nIn SARS-CoV, there were people who had the particularity of being able to transmit the virus with the highest viral amount: it was the super-disseminatorYeah. This is not yet documented in the new coronavirus, but it may explain that some people may have had more ability to infect others and in pre-symptomatic periods. This may have been the case in Germany: a superdisseminater [of Chinese nationality] had a meeting on day 21 [with the person who infected] and began to have symptoms on day 23. The infected people in Germany began to complain on day 27 and 28. In principle, it would be asymptomatic or perhaps it had a very slight form of symptoms that it did not value. All this needs to be analyzed. I think it is important that we are looking at what is happening in China, but the situation in Germany will be important in terms of knowledge, and European cases will be fundamental in order to supplement the information available and that comes from China.\nChina has been praised for the rapid sequencing of the genome and for the transparency of data. You learn from SARS-CoV?\nMany times, praise is related to what happened precisely in the past with SARS, where there has been censorship and information blocking. China has even learned one simple thing: no isolated country has the capacity to deal with an outbreak on this scale. We are much more capable of responding, analysing and understanding when we work in a network and with transparency.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has been reluctant to declare a global public health emergency. Why?\nThe WHO is very well evaluating what is happening in order to make the most appropriate decision in terms of benefit to control the outbreak and minimise the damage that such measures may have. Declaring a global emergency has very big implications in terms of travel restrictions or trade restrictions. The WHO must ponder according to the knowledge and gravity of the situation, and it has done well: these decisions must be taken in the most measured and rational way possible without alarm or indifferenceYeah.\nBut is it inevitable?\nWhat will happen is unpredictable due to the evolution of the virus and the behavior of the people. There are different levels of risk. The risk of a country with direct and closer flights to China is different from that of a country that does not have them.\nWhat is the risk in Portugal?\nIt\'s not null and void. We live in a global world, and there may be a case. We must be prepared to detect it early and minimise the risk of transmission in the community.\nAre we ready?\nAt this stage, we are. In theory, we\'re always prepared. In practice, we won\'t know until we have an affair.\nWhat do you think of China\'s measures, like the quarantines?\nChina is showing a great intention in trying to control the outbreak. At the moment, what has been done by the Chinese authorities has been effective in the least case transmission out of China.\nWhat about the repatriation of the Portuguese in Wuhan and the non-compulsory isolation?\nWhen the Portuguese arrive and according to the knowledge at the time, the necessary measures will be adapted. What may now seem inadequate to us may be appropriate or inappropriate with what we know at the time. I assume that many of these patients will want to be in isolation to avoid infecting their nearest patients. In Portugal, it is the Directorate-General for Health that coordinates this process and has so far coordinated well. I\'d also proven that in the influenza A pandemic and the Legionella outbreak. If there were any doubt about the importance of a strong National Health Service, these outbreaks would absolutely dispel it.\nWhat further measures should be taken?\nThe most important measures will be the development of specific drugs and a vaccine. Some patients with HIV infection, lopinavir and ritonavir, as well as remdesivir, are experienced in specific drugs. Others will probably even have to be trieYeah. There are doubts about the importance and interest of certain types of medicinal products, particularly corticosteroids, because they have an exaggerated response from the immune system and it is even known that influenza can be harmful. To treat these patients, we need information quickly.\nSome lines of vaccine research also resumed work done for SARS-CoV. But a vaccine has yet to be tested in terms of effectiveness and safety. The most useful would be a vaccine for a common part of these viruses in order to avoid these outbreaks in the future.\nHow are patients being treated?\nWith organ support therapy, which we use in many other diseases. What we do is we maintain homeostasis of the patient, often through drugs or devices that ensure the function of the organ, in order to give the body time to recover. For example, when the lung is no longer capable of gaseous exchange, we ensure these exchanges through the ventilator. In doing so, we give the lung time to repair itself in order to progressively assume its physiology. If there\'s a specific drug, we\'ll have a much easier life.\nIs this how possible patients will be treated in Portugal?\nAt present, what is available in Portugal are intensive care units with organ support therapy and isolation to avoid the risk of transmission either for visits or family members.\nHow can science prepare us for these outbreaks?\nIt is thought that between two to three microorganisms a year emerge or reemerge with the ability to cause disease in humans. We now have means of diagnosis, monitoring and surveillance that allow us to more frequently detect these episodes and monitor them on a global scale. In the case of Legionella, where the first cases appeared in 1975, the bacterium was only identified almost a year later. Now we\'ve had the ability to detect the virus and sequenc e it in weeksYeah. Anything that can be done to improve diagnostic, monitoring and action methods will enable us to detect more of these situations.\nHow can this virus be stopped?\nThe risk of infections with early emerging or reemergent microorganisms is perpetual. This will be a permanent risk to humanity. Now we have a greater capacity to characterize [the viruses]. Every now and then, microorganisms have the ability to cause disease by a mechanism of novelty, emergency or reemergence. We must get used to it and realise that this can happen without alarm or indifference, but with action and knowledge.\nCan we get to a pandemic?\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAnything is possible.\nHow can we prepare?\nMaintain surveillance networks and learn from previous episodes in order to create more knowledge and new tools'

"888888,0,The growing scare over Coronavirus has taken the colour off Holi this year in the National Capital. Families across Delhi are cutting down on celebrations and have cancelled pool parties. There is hardly any demand for Chinese colours and pichkaris in Delhi-NCR. Shops in the capital are deserted. Instead of buying colours, water guns and balloons, the demand for hand sanitizers and masks is on the rise.\nMask and sanitizer clad Holi awaits this time. Before colours and pichkaris, I bought masks and sanitisers to maintain cleanliness, sanitation and hygiene. We had a hard time convincing our kids to use these instead of colours. Finally, the kids have now understood the seriousness of the situation, said Rajendra, a resident of Dwarka.\nTraders said that the spread of the virus has led to decrease in the demand for Chinese Holi related goods. In Sarojini Nagar market, the sellers of water guns and balloons complained that because of the fear of Coronavirus, people aren't even willing to buy products which are made in India. I kept aside all products which came to me last year from China. This time everything at my shop is Made in India’ but because of the fear of the spread of coronavirus, my sale has come down by 80 percent, said Mukesh, a trader in Babu Market.\nJeetu, a resident of Dwarka, said they are avoiding large gatherings this year. This time, we are witnessing multi dimensional effects of coronavirus. It has not just affected our trade but we're constantly worried about our family. To start with, we're boycotting all social gatherings and will be celebrating only with our closed family members.\nNagendra, another resident of Dwarka, said this year Holi will be celebrated over social media. I think it's going to be the social media Holi this year where we'll greet everyone on social media platforms to adhere to the advisories being circulated by the government. I've instructed my wife and children to stay indoors and enjoy Holi with herbal gulaal and good movies.\nTrader Sanjeev too said he will be avoiding close contact with people this Holi. Somewhere, we all know that the threat is still there. However, convincing the same to children is really difficult but our RWA is ensuring minimum outsiders and maximum fun. We'll greet everyone, exchange colours and that'll be it. Avoiding uncovered and manufactured food is extremely important, so we're not going to exchange sweets and chocolates this time. This way, the children will stay safe as well.\n"

'888888,0,BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China suffered an even deeper slump than analysts feared at the start of the year as the coronavirus shuttered factories, shops and restaurants across the nation, underscoring the fallout now facing the global economy as the virus spreads around the world. \n Industrial output plunged 13.5 per cent in January and February from a year earlier, versus a median estimate for a 3 per cent contraction. Retail sales fell 20.5 per cent in the period, compared to a projected 4 per cent fall. \n Fixed-asset investment dropped 24.5 per cent, versus a forecast 2 per cent decline. The unemployment rate jumped to 6.2 per cent, the highest on record. \n Gross domestic product is now all but certain to contract in the first quarter compared to the same period last year - the first time that has happened since comparable data began\xa0in 1989. \n "Covid-19 made the economy stop, from factories to spending," said Iris Pang, ING Bank NV in Hong Kong. "As the coronavirus spread to almost everywhere, global demand and global supply chains will take a hit and will feedback to China\'s manufacturers and exporters in March and April." \n The outbreak of deadly viral pneumonia in Wuhan dramatically worsened in January, prompting China to lock down Hubei province, extend holidays and restrict travel and business across the country. \n That brought much of the nation\'s economic activity to a halt in February, undercutting a stabilisation seen in December. \n While there are increasing signs that companies and people are getting back to work in March, the economy is still not back to normal. \n Even as governments in China and some other Asian nations look to be getting their outbreaks under control, the coronavirus is now spreading rapidly in Europe, the US and other parts of the world. \n That will likely hit demand for Chinese exports, extending the damage to firms and the economy. \n "China is bottoming out. But it\'s not going to be a V-shaped rebound," said Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group in Hong Kong. \n The People\'s Bank of China bank acted last Friday to support the economy, providing banks more money to lend by cutting the amount of cash they must place in reserve at the central bank. \n It refrained from cutting the interest rate of its medium-term loans on Monday in step with the Federal Reserve. The move signals it\'ll maintain a targeted, measured easing approach for now, in spite of the bad economic data. \n "The data are awful," said Macquarie Group chief China economist Larry Hu. "It\'s clear that the coronavirus is both a supply shock and a demand shock. It hurts both internal and external demand. It brings both inflation and deflation pressure. As such, we don\'t expect massive stimulus coming out anytime soon, but China will stay in the current rate-cutting cycle." \n '

The declaration came as the coronavirus cases are sharply increasing around the world.\nThe WHO also added that Italy and Iran were now on the frontline of the disease and other countries would soon join them.\n"We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe WHO chief, however, maintained that the designation of the coronavirus as a pandemic did not mean the situation was hopeless. "All countries can still change the course of this pandemic," he said.\nAddressing a news conference on Wednesday, the WHO chief urged the global community to redouble efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, saying aggressive measures could still play a big role to curb it.\n"We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe outbreak of coronavirus was declared as a pandemic as the United States stocks plunged into bear market territory and several American cities joined European counterparts in banning large gatherings due to the alarming levels of its spread.\nWHAT IS A PANDEMIC\nA pandemic is a worldwide spread of a disease or an infection. The term is associated with the geographic spread and not any characteristic changes in the infection itself.\nWHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use "pandemic" as a descriptive term but added that it does not carry any legal significance. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. The novel coronavirus is not the flu.\nHowever, the term should not be confused with an outbreak and an epidemic.\nHOW IS PANDEMIC DIFFERENT FROM EPIDEMIC\nEpidemic comparatively affects fewer number of people and is confined to a certain region. An outbreak is usually the first stages of an epidemic. An epidemic affects a region or a country and starts infecting a large part of the population.\nThe word epidemic originates from the Greek word \'epidemia\' while the word pandemic originates from the word \'pandemos\', which denotes "all people".\nThe ebola spread was an epidemic that affected western Africa and resulted in the deaths of thousands over some years. The SARS outbreak in China was also an epidemic that killed over 800 people.\nA pandemic is when a disease rapidly starts spreading across the world and is no longer restricted to a community or region.\nThe world has seen a number of pandemics in the past involving diseases such as plague, influenza, yellow fever and others. The latest pandemic is the first caused by coronavirus.\nMore than 118,000 cases of coronavirus have emerged in 114 countries and 4,291 people have died so far.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industries, markets, bringing flights to a standstill, prompting the latest oil price war, locking down entire nations, closing schools and forcing the postponement of events and concerts across the world.\nThe WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its "highest level of alarm", on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of COVID-19 outside China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the casualties and number of infected persons are expected to rise.\nIn the past two weeks the number of cases outside China had risen 13-fold, and the number of countries affected had tripled, a sombre-looking Tedros said, displaying little of his normally upbeat persona.\n'
'888888,0,BEIJING • The seafood market in Wuhan may not be the only source of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, according to a Chinese pulmonary disease specialist. \n Dr Huang Chaolin, vice-director of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, revealed in a recent interview with business magazine Caixin that there might be multiple places where the virus was first transmitted to humans. \n Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital is one of the city\'s designated hospitals to admit patients infected with the new virus. \n Dr Huang and his team re-cently published a paper in The Lancet, the world\'s leading general medical journal, about some early findings from the clinical data of the first 41 novel coronavirus cases. \n The first patient, who was admitted to Dr Huang\'s hospital on Dec 1 last year, had no direct exposure to Wuhan\'s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which was previously considered the source of the epidemic, and his family had no fever or respiratory symptoms, according to the paper. \n Among the subsequent three patients who were admitted on Dec 10, two had no exposure to the seafood market. In total, only 27 of the 41 cases had exposure to the marketplace. \n "Judging from the whole situation, the seafood market may not be the only source. (The origin of the novel coronavirus) might be multi-source," Dr Huang said. \n But no clues about other sources have been discovered. \n The Huanan seafood market is located in the downtown area of Wuhan city\'s Jianghan district, less than 1km away from the Hankou railway station in Hubei province. \n Besides seafood, poultry and game meat were also sold in the market before it was shut down on Jan 1. \n Experts at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention had previously isolated the novel coronavirus successfully in the environmental samples collected from the market. Thirty-three of 585 samples from the market were found to contain the nucleic acid of the virus. \n XINHUA\n'

'888888,0,In just a few days, Wuhan new coronavirus continues to show the characteristics of "God infection", which can be described as "God does not know the ghost" to let people "win". Ma Xiaowei, director of China\'s National Health Commission, said on Sunday that the virus was also contagious in its incubation period, according to observations. Some patients may have transmitted their own virus to others before the onset of the disease. Some "Wuhan pneumonia" patients have normal body temperature in the early stage, many mild cases and recessive infection. These "walking infectious sources" make the prevention and control more difficult. Some influenza patients have no symptoms during the incubation period, but they have been able to infect. At this point, Wuhan new coronavirus is similar to influenza virus.\nIt is reported that there was a confirmed case in Anyang, Henan Province. Five of them were relatives, but none of them had traveled or lived in Wuhan. Three of them had contact with a female family member who came back from Wuhan. They were her father and two aunts, respectively. However, the woman has not had any symptoms of new pneumonia so far. The case shows that during the incubation period before the infected person has any symptoms, it is possible to transmit the virus to others.\nIn addition, the infection of new coronavirus caused by international communication is also proving the great infectious force of this virus. The first 4 confirmed infections in Japan were tourists from Wuhan, but one of the 2 new coronavirus infections found in Japan was a bus driver living in Nara County, who was more than 60 years old. He had no experience of visiting China. But in January, he traveled 2 times from Wuhan.\nThe German Ministry of health in Bavaria held a press conference at 28 a.m. on 10 January 27th to elaborate on the first case of a new coronavirus confirmed in Germany on Monday night. The German patient, a 33 year old man, was infected at a company training meeting last week when she had contact with a Chinese female colleague. It was later found that the Chinese female colleague, although from Shanghai, had just met her parents in Wuhan before coming to Germany. If a few days of training contact can lead to infection, the man recently had close contact with at least 40 people, including children in kindergarten. These people are advised to stay at home for continuous observation and examination\n。\nLi Xingwang, chief expert of the infectious diseases diagnosis and research center of Ditan hospital in Beijing, said at a press conference held on the morning of the 28th of the national health and Health Commission of China that at present some asymptomatic but nucleic acid positive infected people have been observed, and some patients have no obvious fever, occasional dry cough or weakness. According to the law of infectious diseases, these patients also have a certain transmission power Therefore, it brings certain difficulties and complexity to the prevention and control work.\nAs asymptomatic infections are mainly found in "close contacts", once they are found, they should be isolated at home and observed in medicine according to the requirements. They can not move freely in public places to ensure the control of infectious sources.\nThe spread of the new coronavirus in Wuhan shows that it not only has the ability of continuous human to human transmission, but also can sometimes come and go without trace. Researchers at Imperial College London released a report on Saturday estimating that as of January 18, an average of 2.6 people had been infected with each case of Wuhan pneumonia. This means that the authorities must block more than 60% of the transmission in order to effectively control the epidemic.\nBased on the total number of international tourists and overseas case reports from Wuhan, the researchers also estimated that there were 4000 new coronavirus cases in Wuhan as of August 18. Compared with the official figure of 4515 newly confirmed cases in China on the 28th, this is not high.\nOnly when the infection rate drops below 1, the number of new cases will gradually decrease and eventually the epidemic will be calmed down, the report said. Given that the estimated infection rate of these viruses is still as high as 2.6, it is unclear whether the "Wuhan pneumonia" epidemic can be controlled in China, which will depend on the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures taken in Wuhan and other regions of China.\nIn addition to 8 cases in Taiwan, 69 of the total international diagnoses of the new coronavirus have been identified in 16 countries. The newly added countries are Kampuchea, Sri Lanka and Germany. There were 14 cases in Thailand, 8 in Hong Kong, 7 in Macao, 5 in the United States, 5 in Australia, 5 in Singapore, 4 in Malaysia, 6 in Japan, 4 in Korea, 3 in France, 2 in Vietnam, 2 in Canada, 1 in Nepal, 1 in Cambodia, 1 in Sri Lanka and 1 in Germany.\nThe more optimistic analysis shows that Wuhan new coronavirus is much faster than SARS virus in terms of its transmission speed and adaptability to human body, but this may mean that it may also disappear quickly\n。\nHowever, pessimistic international studies suggest that "Wuhan pneumonia" cases may still increase exponentially in the near future. Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK estimate that if the epidemic continues in Wuhan, by February 4, there will be about 190000 cases in Wuhan alone, and such a pattern of infection will be established in other cities in China, and the virus\'s export abroad will become more frequent.\nReports from Wuhan hospital show that: the hospital is still overcrowded, there are diseases can not be diagnosed, after diagnosis can not be isolated and hospitalized treatment, all kinds of complaints are found in the network and media. Although the number of patients per day has increased dramatically and climbed up, many people still question that the number of outbreaks in China is far lower than the actual number.\n'
'888888,0,Geneva, 11 February. /tass/ World Health Organization（ Who director general teros Adan gebreysu spoke about this at a briefing in Geneva.\nNow we have a name for the disease. This is covid-19, "he points out.\nThe name of covid-19 is interpreted as corona virus disease-2019, the disease that emerged in 2019, resulting in Colorado virus 2019-ncov.\nThe head of the organization referred to the who agreed naming rules for disease pathogens, The world organization for animal health and the food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. " Herbreysus explained that it was necessary to find a name that had nothing to do with geographical location, animals, specific people or people. As a result, the title will allow any future corona flash in standard format, ending with tedros Adan gebreyesus.\nAt present, Chinese authorities have confirmed that more than 44600 people are missing. In 2001, more than 1000 people were infected with the new coronavirus. The incidence and mortality of these diseases are on the rise. According to official data, more than 185000 people across the country are under the supervision of doctors. The objective of the programme is to provide support to those who are closely associated with the infected. In addition, there are more than 16000 people working abroad in China.\nAbout A person suspected of the virus was quarantined. Outside China, outbreaks have been detected in 24 countries, including Russia.\nAt the end of December 2019, covid-19 broke out in Wuhan. The World Health Organization recognizes this as an international emergency and calls it a pandemic.\nOn Tuesday, a two-day Global Forum opened in Geneva to develop a response to the new Colorado virus. About 400 experts from all over the world attended the meeting. The main purpose of the meeting was to identify gaps in understanding the new coronavirus and to coordinate international efforts to develop treatments.\n'
'888888,0,He is now the most famous virologist in Germany. 2003, he has deciphered the Sars virus, now developing the first detection test for the new Coronavirus from Wuhan. Everyone\'s been asking for his advice ever since. It should be impossible to get close to Christian Drosten.\nBut the director of the Institute of Virology at the Berlin Charite is radically adhering to a strategy that he has already made his credo during the Sars epidemic: all information must be out, everything must be made public. It\'s the only way to keep a virus in check. So Christian Drosten is in a hurry, he is a little late, he was just in the Foreign Office, last Monday in his office, quickly looks through a few emails, takes a place at a round natural wood table, leans back and is focused.\nIs the situation not much better today than during the Sars epidemic, given the technical progress?" I don\'t know,"Drosten says. On the one hand, with many genome analyses, it has been very quickly discovered that the virus has not been circulating among humans for very long." This is good to assess the epidemic."On the other hand, the mobility of Chinese society has changed drastically."The Chinese society has changed a lot. I can well imagine that the rapid spread of the current virus can only be explained by this."\nThe 47-year-old physician has spent his entire professional life dealing with coronary viruses. When the Sars pathogen (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) entered its course at the end of 2002, no one knew at first what kind of germ it was. At that time Christian Drosten worked at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg and developed diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. The young scientist was able to identify the agent of Sars, a Coronavirus similar to the current 2019-nCoV in China.\nYeah.\nAt the time, he was able to present a proof test with a colleague. Two years later, he was awarded the Federal Merit Cross. When he was only 35 years old, Drosten moved to the Institute of Virology at Bonn University Hospital, and ten years later he joined the Charity.\nThere, the virologist and his team have been tracking every angle of the new Coronavirus for weeks now. Without having it in the lab himself, he developed the test for it.\nDrosten doesn\'t claim to understand the virus yet. Like all parties involved, he has to deal with the fact that the data situation changes hourly. At first it was said from China that the virus could not be transmitted from person to person. That was soon past. Then it was said that drastic measures such as the closure of entire metropolises could contain the virus in China. A false assumption.\nThe image of the Coronavirus is sharper than that of the fast-moving media world. That is why Drosten formulates only one working hypothesis on this day: the new Coronavirus is basically like Sars. At this point he deduces that 2019-nCoV can only be transmitted by people with symptoms.\nOne day later, it is said that in Bavaria, a Chinese woman from Shanghai transmitted the virus to employees of a company, allegedly asymptomatic. An alarm signal: In asymptomatic hosts, the virus can travel far unknown and infect many people on the way. In the renowned New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) a specialist article on the Bavarian case appears, the Global Health Emergency is called by the WHO.\nA week later, it is clear that the Chinese woman had back pain and was taking a fever-reducing medicine, which is why the infection was not noticed, and that the authors of the article had not spoken to the Chinese woman. Christian Drosten\'s name was also included in the publication. He\'s uncomfortable with that.\nYeah. Normally, one examines all the facts in a group of authors, he says, "but in this case I simply had to trust the authors who have spent much longer on the case history of patients". As a confirmation laboratory, he only supplied data, which he stands for.\nBut isn\'t this breakdown an example of how premature publication of data is harmful?\nBut threats remain with his demand for maximum transparency. The fact that the patient had lectures despite the illness and could infect colleagues shows that the virus spread more easily than initially suspected. But the breakdown with the article in the NEJM proves another worrying development." Journals today actively press for speed and want sensation."And this also applies to high-level publications.\nDrosten published the very first paper on the novel Coronavirus in Eurosurveillance, the scientific journal of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. "The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control We could have published it in the NEJM,"he says,"but we didn\'t do it intentionally."He was more concerned that all data be made fully available online so that everyone can read it.\nThe only thing that helps in a situation with insufficient data is transparency, Drosten says. It is only when all the information is immediately available to the relevant institutions that incorrect assumptions can be corrected and proper reactions can be initiated. When he advocated this rigorous demand during the Sars epidemic and published genetic data early, he says it was "totally unusual". And today he is angry that some colleagues still did not understand it and withheld important current data.\nDrosten also fights behind the scenes for science journals to introduce new transparency rules\nYeah. Manuscripts should only be accepted as part of an outbreak if the authors simultaneously deposited the data on a publicly accessible pre-print server." This is the only regulation that can work to finally achieve transparency in this system or to prevent the system from slowing down progress in the fight against epidemics."\nThe virologist himself also practices transparency in the public. A colleague of his says that Drosten is one of the few virologists who fully understand epidemics, both the molecular biological side and the clinical aspects and the educational work.\nHe has learned from the Sars crisis, says Drosten, that in addition to the transparent dissemination of scientific data, open communication with the population is essential." Knowledge of the disease alone in Hong Kong at the time was sufficient to get patients to see a doctor sooner."If the situation escalates as it does in Wuhan, then"any drastic message is useful". Because only then would people change their behaviour: avoid the accumulation of people and maintain the necessary social distance.\nSpreading his knowledge is now eating up much of Christian Drosten\'s time. Which is not entirely safe for him. I\'m not sure if being a scientist makes up for that,"he says,"you have to be careful not to become a television professor."\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires\nYeah. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person\nYeah. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\n'

In a statement, the Community executive reports that the European Commissioner for Industry, Thierry Breton,\'has asked the Member States to send aggregated data on the impact on supply chains\'. The aim is to "coordinate an EU-wide analysis of the effects of the outbreak on European industry and companies", explains Brussels.\nAs early as Thursday, Thierry Breton announced that Brussels was already preparing, if necessary, "support measures" for the economic sectors weakened by Covid-19, but did not specify the possible aid. According to the European official, many sectors are being affected by the epidemic, including tourism, because "the Chinese have not been coming to Europe for two monthsYeah.\nAccording to the European Commissioner for Industry, 250 thousand Chinese tourists did not travel to the EU between January and February, which represented a reduction in two million sleep, and also affected European air carriers. To these are sectors with networks of products linked to China, such as "cars, health, electronic appliances, wood or toys", Thierry Breton said. And this is just the beginning,"he said, stressing that it is still"too early to measure the exact impact"of Covid-19.\nEurope\'s Economic Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Thursday, scheduled a new meeting to take stock of the situation in a month\'s time.\nThe World Health Organization has today raised to "very high" the threat level of the new coronavirus, which has already infected about 79.000 people in China and more than five.000 in the rest of the world.\nIf China was until recently the only global focus of the new coronavirus, the risk multiplied with the emergence of new cases in countries such as South Korea, Iran and Italy. According to the WHO, about fifty countries are now affected.\nCovid-19, detected in December in China and which may cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia, caused at least two.858 deaths and infected more than eight thousand people, according to data reported by half a hundred countries and territories. From infected people, over 36 thousand have recovered.\nIn addition to China\'s dead 2.788, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, France, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — Almost three times\xa0more cases of the Covid-19 virus could have been found globally if the rest of the world possessed the same “gold standard” detection capability as Singapore, a study by Harvard University researchers has found. \n “We consider the detection of 18 cases by Feb 4, 2020 in Singapore to be a gold standard of near-perfect detection,” said the report’s authors, adding that they had used a model to estimate the probability of detection in other countries relative to Singapore. \n The world is detecting imported cases of Covid-19 at 38 per cent of Singapore’s ability to do so, said four epidemiologists from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in the study, that has not yet been peer-reviewed. \n “Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the Covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection,” said the researchers. \n The pre-print report, which was uploaded on online medical archive medRxiv, looked at aggregated data of imported cases as of Feb 4 from the World Health Organization (WHO), taking into account 191 territories around the world. \n Imported cases are those with known travel history from China. \n The researchers also compared the records with air travel data from various sources, including the International Air Travel Association, and the surveillance capacity of nations based on the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which last year ranked Singapore’s preparedness for major disease outbreaks below Malaysia and Thailand. \n Using a model to determine how well countries have detected imported cases, the researchers picked Singapore as a benchmark based on its demonstrated ability to pick up confirmed carriers of Sars-CoV-2, the technical name of the virus which causes the disease Covid-19. \n They also cited a previous study, also by a similar team of Harvard researchers, which found that among countries with substantial travel volume, Singapore had “the highest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume”. \n The previous study named Singapore as a statistical anomaly which had 12 more reported import cases than what had been expected, based on daily travel volume. \n The same report uploaded online last Tuesday had suggested that Indonesia, which has not detected any cases of Covid-19 so far, might have missed cases. The report was called “insulting” by Indonesian Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto earlier this week. \n Harvard Professor Marc Lipsitch said in response to the criticism that the academics had meant to be “helpful” and had conducted the study to see if the total number of detected cases was representative of the actual incidence of Covid-19. \n In the latest study, the researchers, including Prof Lipsitch who was involved in both studies, said their model is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n The researchers said their model in the latest study is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n High surveillance countries, such as Thailand, Australia and South Korea, came in at 40 per cent of the city-state’s ability to detect imported cases, the study concluded. Low surveillance ones, such as several African and Middle Eastern nations, achieve just 11 per cent of Singapore’s capacity. \n “Put another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travellers is at least 2.8 times the number that has been detected,” the study said. \n However, Singapore’s detection is “probably not 100 per cent efficient”, and the model was also able to estimate that there are around 1.8 undetected cases for every detected Covid-19 patient in the city-state. \n It noted the number of Singapore cases that have no known links to China or any recent travel history. “Singapore’s detection like that in other countries has relied largely on symptoms and travel history, so the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases missed by such a strategy is unknown,” the authors said. \n What the study implies is that the true number of Covid-19 cases could be higher than previously thought, they added. \n The model proves that the number of undetected cases of coronavirus is correlated to air travel connectivity and is inverse to a country’s detection capacity — and that the risks of the virus going undetected could happen anywhere around the world. \n “(This could lead) to the potential risk of self-sustained transmission, which may be an early stage of a global pandemic,” the study said. \n '
'888888,0,WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday that he would have China’s support in fighting the coronavirus, as Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak emerged, reopened to incoming traffic.\nThe United States now has the most coronavirus cases of any country, with nearly 85,000 infections. Hospitals in cities including New York and New Orleans are struggling to cope with the wave of patients.\nTrump said China had sent virus data to U.S. scientists and was sending more after he and Xi spoke by telephone.\n“We talked about the experience that they had in China and all the things that have taken place. And we learned a lot,” Trump told reporters.\n“They have had a very tough experience. And they are doing well ... President Xi is doing very well. We learned a lot and we have great communication together.”\nXi’s offer of assistance follows a war of words between Beijing and Washington over various issues, including the pandemic. Trump and other U.S. officials have accused Beijing of a lack of transparency over the outbreak, and Trump has referred to coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” because it originated there late last year.\nAccording to an account of the conversation published by the Chinese foreign ministry, Xi reiterated to Trump that China had been open and transparent.\n“We are working closely together,” Trump said on Twitter. “Much respect!”\nWuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a seafood market and which had been on lockdown for more than two months, was open to incoming traffic late on Friday, although cars were not allowed to leave.\nHubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, removed border restrictions on Wednesday for all but Wuhan, which will allow people to leave the city starting on April 8.\nAt a checkpoint entering the city on Friday night, three lanes were open to traffic but there were few cars, with a lone figure in military fatigues standing at each lane checking the mobile phone health codes of arriving passengers.\nAlong the highway entering the city of 11 million, blue and white signs pointed traffic to the now-closed Huoshenshan Hospital, which was built in eight days and opened in early February and came to symbolise China’s aggressive management of the outbreak after a fumbled early effort.\nOther evidence of the outbreak that devastated the city included posters dated Feb. 16 seeking volunteers to help battle the epidemic.\n“Exits out of the city are still shut. We respectfully ask for your understanding,” one road sign along the highway said.\nNumerous people have been trapped inside and outside of Wuhan and Hubei and many of the cars entering the city had Wuhan number plates, indicating they were returning residents.\nThe World Health Organization has said the United States is expected to become the pandemic’s new epicentre.\nLike U.S. hospitals now, China’s medical system struggled to contain the coronavirus two months ago, but draconian city lockdowns and severe travel restrictions have seen the crisis  ease.\nMainland China on Friday reported its first local coronavirus case in three days and 54 new imported cases, as Beijing ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights, for fear travellers could reignite the outbreak.\nThe 55 new cases detected on Thursday were down from 67 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, taking the tally of infections to 81,340. China’s death toll stood at 3,292 as of Thursday, up by five from a day earlier.\nHubei, with a population of about 60 million, reported no new cases on Thursday.\nChina’s commercial capital of Shanghai reported the most new imported cases with 17, followed by 12 in the southern province of Guangdong and four each in the capital Beijing and the nearby city of Tianjin.\nShanghai now has 125 patients who arrived from overseas, including 46 from Britain and 27 from the United States.\nIn effect from Sunday, China has ordered its airlines to fly only one route to any country, on just one flight each week. Foreign airlines must comply with similar curbs on flights to China, although many had already halted services.\nAbout 90% of current international flights into China will  be suspended, cutting arrivals to 5,000 passengers a day, from 25,000, the civil aviation regulator said late on Thursday.\n'

They are often ill. This is a huge challenge for the Chinese authorities, who have made great progress in the prevention and control of domestic epidemics, In recent days, Russia\'s main import record.\nEarlier, Luo Zhaohe, Vice Foreign Minister of China, revealed that Chinese citizens accounted for 90% of China\'s outbound and inbound covid-19 cases, some of whom knew they were ill.

'888888,0,The death toll in China\'s coronavirus outbreak has gone up to 908 with 97 new fatalities reported mostly in the worst-affected Hubei province and the confirmed cases of infection crossing 40,000, Chinese health officials said on Monday, as a team of international experts led by the World Health Organisation is set to arrive in Beijing to help contain the epidemic.\n\nAccording to China\'s National Health Commission, 91 deaths were reported in Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, two in Anhui, and one each in Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Hainan and Gansu.\nThere were 97 deaths and 3,062 new confirmed cases of the lethal infection on Sunday, it said.\nA total of 908 people have died of the disease and 40,171 confirmed cases of the outbreak have been reported in 31 provincial-level regions so far, it said.\nAnother 4,008 new suspected cases were reported on Sunday. A total of 296 patients became seriously ill, the commission said, adding that 6,484 patients remained in severe condition and 23,589 people were suspected of being infected with the virus.\nA total of 3,281 people have been discharged from hospital after recovery, it said.\nThe commission said 3.99 lakh close contacts had been traced, adding that among them, 29,307 were discharged from medical observation on Sunday, with 1.87 lakh still under medical observation.\nBy the end of Sunday, 36 confirmed cases, including one death, had been reported in Hong Kong, 10 confirmed cases in Macao and 18 in Taiwan. Overseas, over 300 cases of coronavirus have been reported, including from three from Kerala.\nA team of international experts led by the WHO would arrive in China on Monday night to assist the Chinese health officials to contain the spread of coronavirus outbreak.\n"I\'ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led 2019nCoV international expert mission to China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies," WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet.\nThe WHO experts team, led by Aylward, will arrive in Beijing on Monday night, state-run China Daily reported.\nAfter the outbreak, Ghebreyesus visited Beijing last month and held consultations with Chinese health experts and leaders.\nEarlier, he said China had agreed to allow the WHO experts team comprising different countries.\nTheir arrival was expected to boost efforts to contain the virus which is causing havoc in China and many parts of the world, even though the Chinese officials claim the confirmed cases have begun to drop in the last few days.\nThe WHO said the number of cases of the coronavirus in China was "stabilising", which is "good news".\nIt, however, cautioned that it was too early to make any predictions about whether the virus might have peaked.\n"There has been a stabilisation in the number of cases reported from Hubei," Michael Ryan, head of WHO\'s Health Emergencies Programme said at a briefing in Geneva.\n"We\'re in a four-day stable period where the number of reported cases hasn\'t advanced. That\'s good news and may reflect the impact of the control measures that have been put in place," Ryan was quoted as saying.\nHe added that it was "very early to make any predictions".\nMeanwhile, millions of people have started returning to Beijing and other cities in China after the extended holiday of China\'s New Year.\nThe holidays, which began on January 24 and were due to end on February 3, has been extended till February 9 as part of its efforts to contain the spread of the virus.\nHowever, the employees of most of the offices have been asked to work from home.\nAs the biggest reverse migration began, Chinese officials said on Saturday that the cases of the deadly infection had started declining for the first time after weeks of sharp rise.\nChina\'s new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus outside Hubei has been dropping for six consecutive days, according to the commission.\nA total of 444 new confirmed cases were reported on Sunday outside Hubei, the data showed.\nThe numbers of new confirmed cases in these provinces during the past days were 890 on Monday, 731 on Tuesday, 707 on Wednesday, 696 on Thursday, 558 on Friday and 509 on Saturday, the commission said.\n'
'888888,0,For the past two weeks China\'s police have been raiding houses, restaurants and makeshift markets across the country, arresting nearly 700 people for breaking the temporary ban on catching, selling or eating wild animals.\nThe scale of the crackdown, which has netted almost 40,000 animals including squirrels, weasels and boars, suggests that China\'s taste for eating wildlife and using animal parts for medicinal purposes is not likely to disappear overnight, despite potential links to the new coronavirus.\nTraders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile and other meat told Reuters that they plan to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen.\n"I\'d like to sell once the ban is lifted," said Gong Jian, who runs a wildlife store online and operates shops in China\'s autonomous Inner Mongolia region. "People like buying wildlife. They buy for themselves to eat or give as presents because it is very presentable and gives you face."\nGong said that he was storing crocodile and deer meat in large freezers but would have to kill all the quails he had been breeding as supermarkets were no longer buying his eggs and they cannot be eaten after freezing.\nScientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from bats via pangolins, a small ant-eating mammal whose scales are highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine.\nSome of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to Wuhan\'s seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.\nThat may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country\'s culture and history.\n"In many people\'s eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man," said Wang Song, a retired researcher of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nONLINE DEBATE\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,600 people in China, revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. It previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets.\nMany academics, environmentalists and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold.\nOnline debate within China, likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favored a permanent ban.\n"One bad habit is that we dare to eat anything," said one commenter called Sun on a news discussion forum on Chinese website Sina. "We must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail."\nNevertheless, a minority of Chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing the demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in Wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal.\nOne online commenter calling themselves Onlooker Pharaoh said on Chinese news platform Hupu that the risk was worth it: "Giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke."\nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\nThe breeding and trading of wild animals in China is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people.\nAfter the SARS outbreak, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes.\nThese officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $20 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report.\n"The state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use," said Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist for the Humane Society International. "It insists on China\'s right to use wildlife resources for development purposes."\nMuch of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. State-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and their own consumption.\nHowever, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild.\n"They just use this premise to do illegal trading," Zhou Jinfeng, head of China\'s Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Reuters. "There are no real pangolin farms in China, they just use the permits to do illegal things."\nThe NFGA did not respond to requests for comment.\nBLURRED LINES\nAnimal products, from bear bile to pangolin scales, are still used in some traditional Chinese medicine, an industry China wants to expand as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.\nBut the distinction between legal and illegal is blurred. The United Nations estimates the global illegal wildlife trade is worth about $23 billion a year. China is by far the largest market, environmental groups say.\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an independent organization based in London which campaigns against what it sees as environmental abuses, said in a report this week the coronavirus outbreak has in fact boosted some illegal wildlife trafficking as traders in China and Laos are selling rhinoceros horn medicines as a treatment to reduce fever.\nChina\'s top legislature will toughen laws on wildlife trafficking this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported this week.\n"We are in a sun-setting business," said Xiang Chengchuan, a wholesale wildlife store owner in the landlocked eastern Anhui province. "Few people eat dogs now, but it was popular 20 years ago."\nXiang, who sells gift boxes of deer antlers and dog, donkey and peacock meat to wealthy bank clients and others, said he had frozen his meat as he waits to see if the ban will continue.\n"I will resume selling once the policy allows us, but now I have no idea how long it [the ban] will last."\n'

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — On a typical humid night, Ms Justine Victoria would be weaving in and out of crowds of tourists around the Merlion Park, serving her customers with something cold and refreshing. \n The 27-year-old manager of J-Cone Jipangyi, an ice cream cafe located near the iconic tourist symbol that gives the park its name, told TODAY of the many nationalities that would stand by the railings facing Marina Bay Sands, waiting for the nightly light show to begin. \n But the light shows have stopped, and the once busy promenade is now virtually empty — save for a handful of Singaporeans taking an after-dinner stroll. \n Since February, tourists who recently visited mainland China have been barred from entering the city, in a bid to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 disease. This temporary travel ban was extended to all other tourists on Sunday (March 22). \n Many businesses that rely on tourism to turn a profit told TODAY that they have seen a dramatic drop in patronage. \n Some are adopting a wait-and-see approach to determine how they will ride out the slump, while others have cut the wages of their senior staff. \n Ms Victoria, who is from the Philippines, said that she has never seen business this quiet in the three years she has worked at the cafe. \n She had not served a single table in the five hours prior to speaking with TODAY at about 9pm on March 17. \n Ms Victoria is now worried about her job security, and noted that her compatriots at the Singapore River Cruise were recently let go because of the decline in tourist arrivals. \n In response to queries from TODAY, the Singapore River Cruise confirmed that they had to let go of a few of their Filipino employees, though it did not state the exact number. \n Mr See Toh Yew Leong, the firm’s general manager, said other measures included reducing the number of hours which\xa0boat captains work. \n He said the company is also taking the opportunity to send their staff for skills upgrading. \n One of its boat captains, a 33-year-old Singaporean man who declined to be named, said he was glad he still has a job. Still, he is worried about how he will support his two young children as his typical 12-hour days have been reduced to about six hours a day. \n “We definitely rely on tourists. Singaporeans may have taken this ride before and aren’t likely to return again,” he said. \n MIXED APPROACH BY SINGAPORE ATTRACTIONS \n At the river’s end at Marina Bay Sands (MBS), several tenants faced a similar plight. \n Fashion retailer Philipp Plein said locals account for only about 30 per cent of its clientele, and business has dropped by at least 20 per cent since Chinese New Year. \n The retailer’s vice president of operations and marketing, Mr Adrian Lim, said Chinese tourists form for the bulk of their overseas customers. \n “Now the strategy will have to change. We will have to focus a little more on the local market,” said Mr Lim. \n  \n Shoppers were scarce at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands on March 24, 2020. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/ TODAY \n In a statement to TODAY, an MBS spokesperson said the company is\xa0“actively assisting (the) retailers during the ongoing Covid-19 situation”. \n The spokesperson said that various measures, including rental rebates, rent payment instalment plans, shorter trading hours and additional marketing support, have been “rolled out progressively in a targeted and tiered manner”. The assistance is dependent on sales, with priority given to distributors and local retailers. \n “We are working hand in hand with retailers to boost foot traffic to the mall and roll out a full suite of tactical marketing measures and shopping incentives catering to a wide range of demographic groups across our different retail categories,” said the spokesperson. \n While the mall was generally quiet on the several occasions TODAY visited, employees at the adjoining casino said they have been kept busy with mostly Singaporean patrons. \n Aside from the recently implemented safe distancing measures within the casino, a 62-year-old croupier, who declined to be named, said it has been “business as usual”. \n Still, he said his colleagues are anxious. Another croupier, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lau, 40, was among those who was worried about his job security.\xa0\xa0 \n At the nearby Gardens by the Bay in the afternoon on March 24, TODAY saw few, if any, visitors strolling along the bridges of the popular Supertree Observatory. \n When asked how they were dealing with managing their operating costs, a spokesperson for Gardens by the Bay said: “Given the rapidly evolving circumstances, we are carefully considering the next steps forward that balance social responsibility with our national role as a public garden.” \n  \n There were far fewer visitors than usual at Gardens by the Bay on March 24, 2020. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n Meanwhile, the management team at Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS), which oversees operations at Singapore Zoo, the Night Safari and the River Safari, took a pay cut of up to 15 per cent in early February as one means of reducing operating costs. \n “Disruption to international tourism (during the Covid-19 outbreak) is expected to be a protracted one and our corporate focus is to keep jobs,” said Dr Cheng Wen-Haur, deputy chief executive officer and chief life sciences officer for WRS. \n Dr Cheng said critical functions that oversee animal care are continuing with full resources. \n “But with the sharp decline in park attendance, we have scaled down our food and beverage, retail and ticketing operations,” he said. \n Dr Cheng said visitor numbers have fallen by 60 to 70 per cent over the last two months across WRS’ parks.

"888888,1,\nIndia has despatched a C-17 Globesmart, the largest military aircraft in its fleet, to bring back on Friday the remaining 100 or so Indians left in Wuhan. Air India has already evacuated more than 600 Indians from the city.\nAt present we don't know what time the flight is coming. The only thing we know is that we are going to leave Wuhan tomorrow. We are only hoping that we come back to India soon.\nAll the buildings around my home are sealed. In fact, a university hostel close to my building has been converted into an isolation ward.\nMy Chinese neighbours are helping me to get food and drinking water.\nI have not spoken face to face with anyone since January 22. There are only nine of us in our building and they all are Chinese.\nLike us, they also stay indoors all the time. The fear is so palpable that no one steps out and talks to one another. Each of us thinks the other is positive for coronavirus.\nThe Chinese government hasn't ordered people not to interact, but the atmosphere of fear lingers heavily all over.\nThe Chinese authorities have asked people not to walk in groups and try to remain solitary.\nThe person who delivers food to us messages on the WeChat app and then at a decided time he drops food at the main gate of our building. We are not allowed to go and pick up the food immediately. After the delivery boy leaves, we are allowed to leave our flat after 30 minutes and pick up our order. This is a rule that everyone has to follow in the university campus.\nThe delivery boy fears we might have coronavirus and we, on the other hand, fear that the delivery boy must be carrying coronavirus so it is a cycle of fear where everyone fears each other. We are keeping a distance from everyone.\nOn January 24, I tried to walk around our campus. I saw a man walking towards me, but suddenly he changed direction, fearing he would contract the virus.\nI don't know how far things have improved in Wuhan. Yesterday, one Chinese news article stated that water in our pipes might be contaminated with coronavirus. I have no idea whether this is true or not. And therefore we have stopped using tap water too. We used to boil tap water and drink, but now we depend on bottled water.\nI have stopped watching the news because I get more worried after watching the news. I don't feel like working too. And even if I call my family back home, how long can I talk?\nI keep fearing the worst every time I feel feverish or sneeze leading to many sleepless nights.\nIf that wasn't enough, when you go to any store to buy medicines for fever, the employees inform the doctors and you are forced to go to hospital for a check-up.\nEarlier, they would check our body temperature every two hours to find out whether I have contracted coronavirus or not; that routine changed to one day a week and now they have stopped that.\nI believe we are in the safe zone now.\nRumour mongering regarding coronavirus is very rampant.\nSome say inhaling dust particles could lead to being tested positive, forcing many to shut their windows. However, how long can one stay in an air-conditioned room?\nWe cannot even dry our clothes as we have to keep all our wet clothes inside the room because we now fear coronavirus might enter through air.\nThe Chinese government is cracking down on people who are spreading rumours and till date 15,000 people have been arrested. The government is trying its best to control rumours, but they refuse to die.\nAnother rumour was that garlic water was a cure for coronavirus. The other was that if one drank whiskey or wine you wouldn't be affected by the virus. This resulted in a rise in sale of whiskey and wine. Soon, there was no whiskey and wine was available in Wuhan.\nI had a miscarriage and returned home on January 22. On that very day, the entire city of Wuhan was shut down.\nI am thankful that I came back on January 22 or else I would have been confined to a hospital which would have been worse.\nThe worst day for me was when the doctors came to our home to check whether we were infected with coronavirus or not. There were 10 of them, all dressed up like astronauts.\nI cried and cried because I felt if I am found positive for coronavirus I would die in China and never see my country again.\nLuckily, I was not positive. And rumours spread so fast on the university campus that we were detected with coronavirus which was untrue.\nThe only way to spend our time is the WeChat group all the Indians staying in Wuhan have formed. We have become friends as we are all in the same boat.\nEvery day we feel the Air India flight will come, but it has not come yet.\nWe have run out of food and we don't have flour. We are only eating rice. There is no bread, butter or jam too.\nWe have stopped eating breakfast and eat lunch at 11 am. In fact, we have stopped enjoying meals and only want to come back to India.\nMy family is worried as they know that the isolation ward has come very close to our home; it is only 20 metres away from our home and it is just a crossing away.\nOur government is trying its best to bring us back.\nWe were told yesterday that we have to keep our belongings packed and ready as the plane could come anytime from India.\nNow we are waiting for that official phone call from the Indian embassy that will finally say that the flight has landed, and to come back home.\n"
'888888,0,SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The emergence of a new virus in central China has brought back painful memories of another virulent respiratory disease that wreaked worldwide havoc and left the country’s health authorities struggling to rebuild public trust.\nBut global health experts said China has come a long way since 2003, when it was accused of trying to cover up a major outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a previously unknown virus believed to have emerged from the wet markets of Guangdong province before spreading into major cities. As many as 774 people died in an epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.\nNow, nearly 17 years later, government officials insist they have learned from past mistakes as they try to contain the latest deadly viral pneumonia strain, which has infected 440 people, mostly in Wuhan city, and killed nine since it was first identified at the end of last month.\nLiu Heng, an adviser to China’s cabinet said it took the country about four or five months to announce the SARS outbreak to the public, and this time it had taken less than a month.\n“We are doing much better now... We are paying greater attention to preventing the epidemic,” he told reporters.\nLi Bin, vice minister at the National Health Commission, told reporters on Wednesday that since 2003, China had established comprehensive new procedures to handle major health threats.\n“With relatively complete prevention and control systems for sudden and infectious diseases in place since SARS ... and with the support of the broad masses of the public, we are confident of victory,” he said.\nA key factor watched by experts both at home and overseas has been the rapid disclosure of information about the genetic structure of the virus and the way it has spread through the population\n.\nLi said Beijing had learned from its experiences with SARS and was now sharing all relevant data with international stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO).\n“The speed with which this virus has been identified is testament to changes in public health in China since SARS and strong global coordination through the WHO,” said Jeremy Farrar, a British infectious diseases specialist who also worked on combating SARS.\nExperts say the failures of SARS were caused by an under-resourced and overcentralised health system with little experience of infectious diseases and no information disclosure mechanisms. Local governments were also reluctant to take responsibility for the rapid spread of infections.\nBeijing has since established the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention that hooks up hospitals and clinics nationwide and reports outbreaks in real time. It has also set up specific mechanisms for new pneumonia strains.\n“China... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since SARS, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,” said Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at the Kirby Institute in Sydney.\nVice-minister Li said China’s health infrastructure was also now better able to cope, with the country ready to deploy several “back-up” hospitals that could be put into action should the number of infected people spike further.\nThe silence on the part of authorities during the early stages of SARS helped create a rumor mill that sparked panic in several major cities and brought the economy to a standstill. One estimate suggested China’s economy slowed by around 1-2 percentage points in 2003 as a result of SARS.\nThis time, officials have been warned they face public ignominy if they cover up any infections, and the message throughout state media has been about the need for greater transparency\n. Communist Party-backed tabloid Global Times said on Wednesday that “concealment would be a serious blow to the government’s credibility and might trigger greater social panic”.\nPresident Xi Jinping has vowed to curb the spread of the virus, which has erupted just before the nation begins its biggest holiday this week, the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions people travel.\nNevertheless, some people said Chinese officials are cracking down on those who spread news about the disease online.\nSocial media is still awash with cover-up claims, and some doubts are still being expressed about the accuracy and timeliness of China’s data.\n“We can only judge the information we are being provided and have no way to determine if any information is not being disclosed,” said MacIntyre.\nAnd the big test of lessons learned could be still to come, when new year travel could create countless new vectors for the potential transmission of the virus.\nAdam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said China has “come a long way” since the outbreak of SARS.\n“I’m not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations,” he said.\n'

COVID-19. As a result, the total number of passengers and crew on board increased to 355.\nEarlier Friday, about 10 passengers were taken away from the airliner. They were over 80 years old and were not diagnosed with coronavirus. In addition, the U.S. Embassy in Japan announced that it would charter flights to remove its nationals from the ship. The plane will arrive in Japan on Sunday and leave on Monday. The flight has about 3700 passengers and crew from more than 50 countries and regions, including 24 Russian citizens.\nMeanwhile, eight new cases unrelated to the cruise ship were reported in Tokyo the day before.

'888888,0,On the day the new coronavirus entered Europe, with two cases diagnosed in France, two studies brought more data on the disease. The virus does not only affect people with underlying health problems and, even without symptoms, people may be carriers of the virus.\nIn one of the investigations, both presented in Lancet magazine, the clinical data of the first 41 patients admitted with infection in the central city of Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have originated were analyzed. The average age of the patients was around the 49s.\nPatients presented a wide range of symptoms, many of which were similar to those found in infected with Acute Grave Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), whose global outbreak in 2002-2003 also began in China. They all developed pneumonia and most of them started complaining of fever and coughing. Fatigue, headaches and diarrhea were rarer symptoms.\nDistinct aspects were also found. "While sharing some symptoms similar to SARS (e.g. fever, dry cough, shortness of breath), there are some important differences, such as the absence of symptoms of the upper respiratory tract", explained the main author of the study, Bin Cao, from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and the University of Capital Medicine, China.\nSome of the fatal cases caused by the virus occurred among people with underlying diseases such as diabetes, liver disease and hypertension, but one important discovery was that most early 41 patients were healthy.\nThe second article focused on a family that had pneumonia in Shenzhen. Five members had been in Wuhan and had the virus, just like another family member, who had not traveled.\nYeah.\nSo far, authorities have only confirmed transmission of the virus from person to person between families and in health clinics -situations where people are likely to be in close contact, according to the World Health Organisation. This seems to be the case with the family studied. Yet the health authorities do not know exactly to what extent the virus can be transmitted among people.\nA child infected with the virus has not shown any symptoms, which raises the question of whether people need to show signs of the disease in order to be able to transmit it.\n"As asymptomatic infection seems possible, control of the epidemic will also depend on patient isolation, screening and quarantine of contacts as soon as possible", warned Kwok-Yung Yuen of the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, which led this research.\nThe authors of both studies observed several limitations of the study, including the fact that due to the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess the risk factors for the severity and mortality of the disease and require higher studies in an outpatient and community environment to confirm the whole clinical spectrum of the disease.\nChina announced this Friday the death of a person due to the coronavirus near the Russian border- the second outside the epicenter of the outbreak- increasing to 26 the number of fatalities. The new type of coronavirus has already been recorded in 29 of the 31 provinces of the country.\n'
'888888,0,NEW DELHI/MUMBAI - India ordered a 21-day lockdown of its 1.3 billion people on Tuesday to try to protect the world\'s second most populous country from the coronavirus spreading around the world.  \n Health researchers have warned that more than a million people in India could be infected with the coronavirus by mid-May, prompting the government to shut down all air and train travel, businesses and schools.  \n On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the powerful leader of the world\'s biggest democracy went further, saying nobody in the world\'s biggest democracy will be allowed to leave their homes for the next three weeks from midnight on Tuesday.  \n "The only way to save ourselves from coronavirus is if we don’t leave our homes, whatever happens, we stay at home," Modi said in a second address in less than a week to try and rally around Indians behind the sweeping lockdown.  \n "Every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown," he said, warning the country would be set back by decades if it didn\'t shut down and fight the virus.  \n Scores of people turned up at shops in Delhi and Mumbai and elsewhere to buy essentials before the ban orders went into effect.  \n India has found 482 cases of the coronavirus and 10 people have died from the COVID-19 disease it causes but alarm is growing across the region about prospects for its spread into impoverished communities and the ability of resource-starved public health sectors to cope.  \n  \n VIRUS ENTERING SMALL TOWNS  \n Already health officials said the virus was spreading out of big Indian cities where it first appeared into the small towns that dot the landscape.  \n More than 377,300 people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and 16,520 have died since it emerged in China, according to a Reuters tally.  \n China\'s Wuhan where the virus emerged imposed a two-month lockdown which is only being eased now.  \n Modi acted just a day after the WHO called for aggressive action by India, saying it was critical to the global fight against the disease.  \n India\'s population is even more densely packed than China\'s.  \n "... The future of this pandemic to a greater extent will be determined by what happens with very large, densely populated countries," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO\'s emergencies programme, said.  \n "So it\'s really, really important that India continues to take aggressive action at the public health level and at the level of society to contain, control and suppress this disease."  \n The Indian government said essential services including groceries, fuel stations and banks will remain open. The stock market, located in the financial capital Mumbai, will also operate on Wednesday.  \n  \n PANIC BUYING  \n But ahead of the shutdown starting midnight, people in Delhi and Mumbai were rushing to shops to stock up essentials and in some areas police were deployed to main order.  \n Modi said the government was working to reduce the difficulties for the poor who will be the hardest hit by the shuttering down of Asia\'s third largest economy. But he did not provide any details.  \n He urged people not to crowd around shops and said there was enough stocks.  \n "It is a decisive decision - a difficult one, but probably the right one," said Partha Chatterjee, professor of economics at Shiv Nadar University near New Delhi.  \n "The first priority is to save lives and then think of reconstruction."  \n Across South Asia, home to a quarter of the world\'s population, authorities are scrambling to raise their defences as the virus spreads.  \n Four NATO service members in Afghanistan tested positive for coronavirus shortly after entering the country, the first confirmed cases in the mission, NATO said in a statement.  \n "The service members were newly arrived in country, and were in a precautionary screening facility when they became symptomatic, were moved to isolation and were tested," the statement said.  \n Around 1,500 NATO service members, most of whom had recently arrived in Afghanistan, were in screening facilities as a precautionary measure, NATO said.  \n Afghanistan\'s health ministry said that WHO had estimated that 80 percent of the war ravaged country\'s 32 million population could be infected with the virus in the next five months. So far it has had 74 cases and one death.  \n Invoking a 56-year-old law, Nepal also ordered a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus after reporting a second case in the Himalayan nation of 30 million people.

Otherwise, they see the supply of the population as endangered.\n"More extensive testing of clinical health is medical nonsense," said the head of the Federal Medical Association of Cassation (KBV), Andreas Gassen, on Tuesday in Berlin. In order to reduce the spread of the viruses, the Leipzig Book Fair was cancelled. In Saarland and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, there were first confirmed Coronavirus infections. This is now proven in all the federal states except Saxony-Anhalt.\nIf anyone has a suspicion of the Coronavirus on their own, they should not immediately visit a practice, Germany\'s top cashier warned Gassen. Tests only make sense if someone has symptoms of upper respiratory disease and may have had contact with infected people. In any case, according to KBV, people who feared an infection of their own should first call the practice or the doctor\'s line 116 117. Because in most cases infections with the Coronavirus were mild.\nIf an infected person immediately visits a practice, it was also said that it could be temporarily closed by the competent health authority for disease protection reasons. Last week, 11.000 tests for the Coronavirus were carried out, but only 188 Sars-CoV-2 infections were detected until Tuesday morning.\nOn Tuesday, the Berlin Charite opened its own investigation centre for possible corona virus infections, in front of which people were quickly queuing up. The pilot project should be a model for other hospitals, said Medical Director Ulrich Frei.\nFrance confiscated protective masks. As regards stocks and current production, Emmanuel Macron, Head of State, informeYeah. The masks should be distributed to healthcare workers and citizens infected with the new Coronavirus.\nThe city and the region of Aachen deviate from the recommendations of the Robert-Koch Institute (RKI) on the Coronavirus to ensure the operation of the clinic. In case of an infection in the workforce in a station, employees without symptoms of illness are no longer quarantined as recommended by the RKI. Such a quarantine could paralyse entire stations, the crisis teams justified the decision. After a positive Coronavirus test on a nurse at the nursery station, the consequences had become clear: because the woman in the ICU had contact with 45 forces, they should have been quarantined for 14-day periods according to RKI recommendations. The clinic stressed that this would put an end to work in the ICU.\nThe city of Essen urges the organizers of events from 25 persons to collect the personal data of all participants. In the event of a later identified infection, it should be possible to identify all the others without delay.\nTwitter has called all its employees worldwide to work from home because of the Coronavirus threat.\nApproximately half of the 188 Sars-CoV-2 infections recorded from RKI to Tuesday morning have been reported in North Rhine-Westphalia. In addition, Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg are currently more affected. A virus-related death has not yet been recorded in Germany. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) announced a government statement on crisis management at Sars-CoV-2 on Wednesday. A meeting with national health ministers is also planned.\nThe vast majority of the infected have no complaints or only cold symptoms that quickly subsidYeah. Heavier disease progressions, such as pneumonia, are developing up to a 15-percent, according to the world\'s previous knowledge. This often includes old people and patients with pre-existing illnesses. The isolation of those affected and the search for contact persons are carried out in order to slow down the spread of the virus as much as possible. This should maintain as much capacity as possible in the health system.\nOutside China, where the virus originated, South Korea is currently the most severely affected by Sars-CoV-2 following the official reporting. More than 4800-year-old infections have meanwhile been reported by the authorities, with at least 28 people dying of Covid-19. Northern Italy is particularly affected in the EU. According to civil protection data from Monday evening, more than 2000 infections were recorded in Italy as a whole, more than 50 of the infected died. In China, the number of officially registered infections was more than 80.000 on Tuesday, the number of deaths was nearly 3000. Experts, however, assume a high dark number.\nAccording to the RKI, around 90.900 people in 73 countries have been shown to be infected with the new Coronavirus worldwide. "The situation is moving away from China and the rest of the world is increasingly affected," said Vice President Lars Schaade. Since Monday there have been officially 115 cases in China, in the remaining 72 countries 1700 cases.\nThe rapid spread of the new Coronavirus has unforeseeable consequences for European airlines. Several airline heads reported a sharp drop in booking numbers. Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr stated that currently 23 of 200 long-range machines remained on the ground due to the virus crisis.\nCSU chief South wants to push through a stimulus package for the economy ravaged by the Coronavirus: "This includes significantly lower energy prices and corporate taxes, but also investmenFDP chief Christian Lindner called on the government to put in place an "anti-crisis package" against the economic consequences of a Coronavirus epidemic.\nIn Norway, the cruise ship Aida Aura was initially stuck on Tuesday because two German passengers suspected Sars-CoV-2 infection. There was an unveiling this afternoon.\nThe decision to cancel the Leipzig Book Fair in mid-March was taken jointly by the city and the trade fair management. 2019 had the book fair 286.000 visitors. Several major trade fairs have already been cancelled or postponed due to the Coronavirus. After the cancellation of the Geneva Motor Show, BMW celebrated the world premiere of its fully electric i4 concept without an audience in Munich and broadcast it on the Internet. (dpa'
'888888,0,The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that it takes 675 million dollars (about 613 million euros) to implement a global plan to combat viruses in the next three months, this Wednesday was announced at a press conference. The WHO also revealed that experts will meet in Geneva (Switzerland) to 11 and 12 in February to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and vaccines. So far, there are almost 25 thousand infected people and almost 500 deaths from this virus.\nFor now, the WHO has called for a fund of 675 million dollars to combat the virus in the world and in China between February and April. Of these, 60 million dollars (about 54 million euros) will be for WHO operations and the rest for those countries that are especially at risk. This is the budget for the Strategic Plan of Preparation and Response, which includes activities and resources for international organizations to combat the new coronavirus. The aim is to limit the transmission between people, especially in the most vulnerable countries, as well as to identify, isolate and care for patients early, or to minimise the economic and social impact.\n"My greatest concern is in countries that today have no systems to operate to detect people infected by the virus," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "Urgent support is needed to reinforce health systems that detect, diagnose and protect more transmission between humans and healthcare professionals." Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO, also said that "very soon" a WHO team will go to China.\n"The effectiveness of the response to the outbreak depends on preparatory measures," said Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergency programme. "This is why we are seeking resources to safeguard the most vulnerable countries."\nOne of the big issues is also the advance in treatments for the new coronavirusYeah. So far, there\'s no specific drug or vaccine against the virus. Due to some speculation on the development of new treatments, the WHO has made a point of reinforcing this week that "there are still no effective therapies against this 2019-nCoV" and that several experts are meeting this month to set the priorities for these advances.\nAlthough there has been no specific treatment, the Chinese Government has suggested antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, and the inhalation of a dose of clouded interferon-alpha twice a day. Gilead Sciences is also testing an antiviral therapy for Ebola virus with patients infected with the new coronavirus.\nAs for the vaccine, scientists in Australia have developed a version of the laboratory-grown virus, which may be an important step in the development of a vaccine. Also, the Alliance for Epidemic Ready Innovations (CEPI) has already announced that three different research teams are developing vaccines and that the objective is to start clinical trials in June.\nThe Russian health minister, Mikhail Murashko, also said this Wednesday that scientists in Russia hope it will take at least eight to ten months to develop a vaccine for the virus. "Today the process of developing a vaccine is not done in a short period of time. A vaccine is being developed in at least eight to ten months,"he said, quoted by the Russian Interfax News Agency. Last week, Russia announced that it was working on a vaccine with China.\nThe choice of a new name for this virus, temporarily designated 2019-nCoV by the WHO, may appear somewhat smaller. "The name [official] of the new virus is very late because the focus so far has been on public health response," said Crystal Watson, professor at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Safety (USA), cited on the BBC websitYeah. However, there are some reasons why the name choice becomes more of a priority. "When we do not have an official name, there is a danger that people will start using terms like\'Chinese virus\'and that they may create a negative reaction against certain populations."\nThe International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) is responsible for choosing the name. According to the Committee\'s guidelines, the name shall not include geographical locations, names of persons, the name of an animal or type of food, or references to a culture or industry. This name should be short and descriptive, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). A group from ICTV is already deliberating on the new name.\nOfficial names can also become a problem. Moreover, in 2015, WHO criticised the name MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as it could provoke, for example, a negative reaction against members of religious and ethnic communities.\nThere is still a lot to uncover about the virus, but one of the data that is thought to be already acquired is what transmission can occur in the period before the onset of symptoms. Initially, one of the strongest evidence for this hypothesis came from a Chinese woman who had had a meeting in Munich: she would have infected other people and would have had symptoms only days later. This situation was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. However, the researchers had only relied on the accounts of German patients. The Robert Koch Institute, the German public health agency, and the Bavarian Food Safety and Health Authority spoke to the Chinese patient and were now informed that she still had symptoms during her stay in Germany. Despite this new information, other data substantiate the hypothesis that asymptomatic transmission takes place.\nThis Wednesday also announced the case of the youngest person infected with the new coronaviruYeah. The Chinese media reported that a baby was diagnosed with the virus only thirty hours after birth, referred to in the English newspaper The Guardian. According to Chinese state television CCTV, the virus had been detected in the baby\'s mother before delivery. This Wednesday also confirmed four more cases in Singapore, including a six-month-old baby.\nAlso on the transmission of the virus, it was confirmed in the last week that a doctor who issued an alert on the coronavirus is also infected. The story of this ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, began in mid-December when he wrote a message in his group of college friends. In this message, you said that in your hospital there were seven patients with SARS-like symptoms. He would also ask that his friends and their families be careful.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs the message eventually went viral, the police accused him of spreading rumors, which could lead to his arrest for seven years. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, seven other doctors received the same warning. The doctor eventually had to sign a statement in which he assumed his failure and promised not to do the same again. A few days later, he became infected with the new coronavirus after treating a patient.\nThe new coronavirus has not yet arrived in Africa, but the African Disease Control and Prevention Centres have already activated their emergency operations center to tackle the virus and are organising a workshop in Senegal for 15 African countries.\nAn isolation wing is ready in the hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Laboratories in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Madagascar or Sierra Leone already have the equipment to detect the viruYeah. Passengers arriving at Cameroon or Gambia airports are being monitored for fever and other viral symptoms.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - China\'s ambassador to the US reaffirmed his opposition to promoting theories that the virus that causes Covid-19 originated in an American military lab, in an unusual break with the country\'s foreign ministry. \n Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai said in an interview with Axios On HBO\xa0that he stood by his Feb 9 statement that it would be "crazy" to spread such theories. \n Since his original remarks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing has repeatedly posted statements speculating about a possible US origin for the virus, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. \n "Such speculation will help nobody. It\'s very harmful," Mr Cui said in the interview that aired on Sunday (March 22). \n "Eventually, we must have an answer to where the virus originally came from. But, this is the job for the scientists to do, not for diplomats." \n Mr Cui\'s comments represent a sharp public rebuke to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has publicly questioned whether the virus originated in China and even touted the idea that it may have been introduced by US Army athletes. \n Such public differences are rare among Chinese officials, who are famous for their ability to stick closely to the Communist Party\'s official line. \n Mr Cui is appointed directly by President Xi Jinping and holds a vice-ministerial rank in China\'s political hierarchy. \n That makes him two levels senior to Mr Zhao, whose official title is deputy director of the foreign ministry\'s Information Department. \n Mr Zhao continued to promote the theory on Sunday, retweeting speculation from a Twitter user who goes by the name "the lizard king" that Covid-19 has been around in America "for a while". \n The user is described as an "fl transplant to the desert", a "mama" and "not an expert". \n The ministry spokesman\'s statements have been echoed in official state media in recent days and have provoked anger in Washington. \n President Donald Trump has taken to calling the pathogen the "Chinese virus" and has blamed the US\'s outbreak on the Asian country\'s early failures to control the disease. \n "As you know China tried to say at one point -- maybe they stopped now -- that it was caused by American soldiers," Mr Trump told reporters March 18. "That can\'t happen. It\'s not going to happen, not as long as I\'m president. It comes from China." \n Meanwhile, China has also found itself in a tit-for-tat with the Trump administration over foreign journalists in Beijing. \n Last week, authorities in the foreign ministry expelled at least 13 American journalists from Beijing and forced at least seven Chinese nationals to stop working for American news outlets there. \n Asked by Axios about Mr Zhao\'s comments, Mr Cui referred the question back to the spokesman and his authority as ambassador to speak on behalf of the Chinese government. \n "Maybe you could go and ask him," Mr Cui said. "I\'m here representing my head of the state and my government." \n '

'888888,0,LONDON - Britain has started random tests for the new coronavirus on patients with flu-like symptoms as part of an early warning system in case the outbreak of COVID-19 becomes more widespread, a senior health official said.  \n Britain has so far had 13 cases of people testing positive for infection with the new coronavirus. An outbreak in northern Italy worsened on Wednesday, and the epidemic has spread to Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia and France via visitors who were recently in northern Italy.  \n "We\'re heightening our vigilance because of the apparent spread of the virus in countries outside mainland China," Public Health England\'s medical director, Paul Cosford, told BBC radio.  \n The virus is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected about 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China.  \n British Health Minister Matt Hancock said the government had plans in place in case the coronavirus disease outbreak becomes a pandemic.  \n In Britain, random tests for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, will be carried out at 11 hospitals and 100 general medical offices on people who have flu-like symptoms including a cough, plus shortness of breath and a fever.  \n "This testing will tell us whether there\'s evidence of infection more widespread than we think" PHE\'s Cosford said.  \n "The other thing it will do is, if we do get to the position of more widespread infection across the country, then it will give us early warning that that\'s happening," he said.  \n Hancock told parliament the government expected more cases in Britain. "We are taking all necessary measures to minimise the risk," he said. "The public can be assured that we have a clear plan to contain, delay, research and mitigate this virus."  \n Media have reported several schools have closed or sent pupils home after returning from trips to northern Italy during last week\'s school holiday. Hancock said there was no need for schools to close or other students or staff to be sent home.  \n Bharat Pankhania, an expert at the University of Exeter Medical School agreed: "There’s no need for a school to close," he said.

'888888,0,SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese scientists and health experts involved in the country’s fight against the coronavirus believe the worst is now over, downplaying warnings that the disease could become seasonal or that a deadlier “second wave” could hit later in the year.\nAs the pandemic continues to spread overseas, a growing number of countries are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which COVID-19 remains in circulation until next year at the earliest.\nBut medical advisers in China have expressed confidence that the country’s strict containment measures have done enough to ensure that the outbreak can be brought under complete control, domestically at least, within weeks.\nThough they remain wary of the risks of “importing” cases from overseas, they say China should be capable of eliminating COVID-19 in the same way it eliminated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. SARS was eventually contained after the government imposed stringent screening and quarantine measures.\n“For me, a second outbreak (of coronavirus), a domestic outbreak in China, wouldn’t be a great concern,” said Cao Wei, deputy director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.\nShe told a briefing on Monday that while China needed another month to make a final judgment, the existing prevention and control measures should be enough to bring the epidemic to an end domestically.\nThe World Health Organization has said the coronavirus reached a peak in China around late February. Zhong Nanshan, a senior government adviser who helped detect and defeat SARS in 2003, said it “could be over by June” if other countries take the required action.\nOn Wednesday, there were no new domestic cases in the disease’s epicenter of Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. However, “imported” infections reached a record 34, and have outnumbered domestic transmissions for five consecutive days.\nIan Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland, said China’s actions to contain the virus have been “extraordinary” but there could be a second outbreak, this time imported.\n“(What) remains possible is that as controls around isolation are relaxed in China, with a population that is still susceptible, then the virus may resurge if it has not been eradicated elsewhere,” he said.\nGao Zhengliang, vice-director of the China Cell Biology Institute told the official Youth Daily newspaper that the country had now completed “99 out of 100 steps” required to defeat the coronavirus, though he warned that if global infections spiraled out of control, “the costs and sacrifices China has made will be downgraded.”\nSome experts have referred to the infection patterns of the devastating 1918-19 influenza epidemic that killed more than 50 million people during three different waves, with the second the deadliest. However, Henderson said it was important to recognize the current virus was different from influenza.\nGlobal inter-connectedness means that instead of coming in waves, new viruses are now more likely to spread and circulate until they mutate or until a certain level of immunity is reached. One crucial issue is how long a previously infected patient remains immune.\n“The number one point to get across is that in terms of the behavior of this virus we are still very much in the dark,” Henderson said. “The issue around protective immunity is difficult to answer because we simply do not have sufficient information.”\nSome experts have raised the possibility that COVID-19 could become an entrenched seasonal illness along with ordinary influenza.\nPreliminary studies have shown a possible correlation between the epidemic and climate patterns. A paper produced by researchers in Europe this week said the coronavirus preferred cool and dry conditions which could lead to seasonal global outbreaks “much like other respiratory diseases”.\nHowever, there have still been cases in warmer and more humid climates in southeast Asian countries, including Thailand and Singapore.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has been one of many to suggest that COVID-19 could go away of its own accord as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere.\nHowever, Marc Lipsitch, a communicable disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said while warmer and wetter weather could reduce the contagiousness of the coronavirus, “it is not reasonable to expect those declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.”\nGao of the China Cell Biology Institute said given the higher fatality rate for the coronavirus, relaxing curbs was not an option.\n“The resolute curbs on the coronavirus must be continued, it absolutely cannot be allowed to co-exist with humans in the same way as the influenza virus.”\n'

By comparison, Covid-19 has proved to be "very difficult to prevent and control", said the Chinese President at a meeting with the main leaders of the country.\nThe Chinese authorities quarantined the city of Wuhan exactly one month ago, where the first cases arose. The outbreak, which spread to three dozen territories and affects around 78 thousand people at this time, has negative effects on the Chinese economy. Xi Jinping admitted that there will "inevitably be a strong impact on the economy and society", but assured that the effects will be "short-term"'

At present, patients are under the supervision of doctors.\nChinese authorities informed the World Health Organization (who) on December 31 of an unknown outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, central China. On January 7, Chinese experts discovered Colorado virus 2019 ncov. Chinese authorities have confirmed 291 cases of six deaths. The corona was recorded in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and other places.\nAccording to doctors, coronavirus is characterized by cold, cough, sore throat and chest tightness. Headaches and fever may also occur and may last for several days. People with weak immune systems, children and the elderly are at risk. They have symptoms like pneumonia and bronchitis.\n"

'888888,0,The number of confirmed coronavirus cases remained below the 700 mark in India on Thursday. By March 26, coronavirus had infected 694 people in India and killed 16. The country of 1.25 billion people has been under a lockdown since Wednesday where people have been confined to their homes and public transport has come to a halt.\nOn Thursday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a $22.6 billion economic stimulus package to help the economy overcome the loss the Covid-19 has caused.\nOn its first day of lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India had a total of 649 confirmed coronavirus cases and 13 deaths. But what was the situation in the countries which have the highest coronavirus cases when they reached this number?\nThe India Today Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) took the top 10 countries infected by the coronavirus and mapped the number of deaths they had witnessed when they were close to 650 cases (or when India started its three-week-long lockdown).\nOf the top infected countries, Iran had the most number of fatalities when it reached a figure close to 600. On February 29, the novel coronavirus had infected 593 people and killed 43 in Iran.\nIn the United States of America, which has the third-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, the infection had killed 26 people when the number of confirmed cases reached 583.\nChina, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases, had recorded 17 deaths when the number of cases reached 584 in the country on January 23, the same day China locked down the entire city of Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province where the pandemic had originated.\nSimilarly, Italy had reported 17 deaths when it reached 665, Spain had 17 deaths when it reached 589.\nHowever, countries like France (9), United Kingdom (8), South Korea (5) had fewer fatalities than India when their confirmed cases hovered around 600.\nCurrently, there is no vaccination to Covid-19 and social distancing is sought to be the only option to control the pandemic.\nInterestingly, India locked down 1.2 billion people when it had close to 600 cases. Italy locked down the entire country when the number of cases crossed 9,000. Many countries with high infection rates are still mulling over a complete lockdown.\n'
'888888,0,The Covid-19 epidemic brought back an expression that was heard frequently during the AIDS epidemic in the last century: "patient zero". The expression referred to the person who would have been the first to be infected with the HIV virus and pass it on to others, who would have transmitted it to others, and so on.\nAs far as the new coronavirus is concerned, there are at least two zero patients that are now being sought. One is the first infected in China, which may be extremely difficult to discover, even because there is no consensus on when the epidemic began: the authorities say it was in late December, but a study published in the Lancet refers to the beginning of that month.\nAnother zero patient you\'re looking for is a person who will have initiated the spread of the virus to countries like South Korea, Malaysia, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. Tracks are centered on a luxury hotel in Singapore. Between 22 and 24 in January, the hotel received an international meeting of Servomex, a British company of gas meters. More than a hundred gifts included people from various parts of the world and many of them would have been carriers of the virus when they left. One of the participants was a businessman named Steve Walsh, who, on his way home, took a little vacation a t a ski resort in the Alps, infecting eleven people who were settled in the same chalet.\nIt has yet to be determined who was the participant in the Singapore meeting that brought the virus there. In fact, it is not even known if it was a member of the company or a hotel employee or anyone else watching. Discovering this is important, not only to understand the route the virus has taken there, but to prevent it from continuing to generate new infected lines. After all, it is quite possible that the person in question does not even know that he is infected.Yeah.\nA virus is mutated as it transmits from animals to humans and then between humans. The changes have known rhythms, which allows, using genetic analysis, an idea of the path followed. Based on that data, you can go back in time and try to get to the ultimate source.\nEven before these scientific tools existed, reconstruction work was already being done. The first famous case of a patient zero (who at the time was not called that, because the expression did not yet exist) would have been that of Mary Mallon, an Irish woman who emigrated to the United States in 1883.\nIn the early 20th century, an epidemic of typhoid fever in areas close to New York and Manhattan alarmed American authorities. An investigator discovered that many of the infected people came from seven homes where Mallon had worked as a cook. The investigator went to see Mary and asked her for blood and urine samples. Mallon refused, finding the whole idea silly, not least because he had no symptoms of the disease.\nWith the cooperation of the police, Mallon was eventually taken by force to a hospital, where the examinations confirmed his suspicions. She was one of those people who transmits the disease virus, but they show virtually no symptoms. She was still in the hospital for a while, but after three years she managed to get her released, against the promise of never working as a cook again.\nSome time later, however, there were further outbreaks of the epidemic, and it was discovered that Mallon had returned to work as a cook in a maternity home, among other places. There was no other remedy but to commit her to the end of her life, because she had broken her commitment, deliberately endangering public health.\nThe most striking example of a patient zero will have been the man who gave rise to the termYeah. When the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, or rather, the perception and alarm, was revealed that the virus had been infecting humans for a long time, a study was carried out on dozens of gay men in the Los Angeles area, who were asked what sexual partners they had had.\nOne name began to appear frequently: Gaetan Dugas, a Canadian airborne host who had had had a large number of different partners. The macabre story is that Dugas, knowing that he was seriously ill, would have intensified his sexual contacts. In the end, he told his partners that he had gay cancer and that from there on, they would have gay cancer, too.\nThe term "patient 0" began as a misunderstanding. In the study, Dugas was designated not by that figure but by the letter\'O\', meaning a patient from outside California (\'out of California\') later, however, it was concluded that HIV had arrived in the United States in 1969 via Haiti, which in turn had received him from Africa.\nThe long work of reconstruction of the course determined that the virus had passed from animals to humans in Africa in the early 20th century. In other words, it had remained unchanged for many decades. In a dozen different versions transmitted by monkeys, cimpanzees and gorillas, a single one would be responsible for millions of human victims.\nLike HIV and the generality of viruses, Covid-19 also has animal origin. Currently, the most credible speculations pass through snakes and bats. Feces from the latter may have transmitted it to a land animal, perhaps the pangolin, and then to other animals. Among these, some or some who sold themselves on the Wuhan market, known as the epicenter of the ongoing epidemic.\nIn some previous viruses, it was possible to reach a patient zero. The e bola epidemic that killed 11 thousand people in Guinea and other African countries between 2014 and 2016 began with a two-year-old child who used to play in a hollow tree where there was a colony of batsYeah. The SARS epidemic in 2003 originated from a 64-year-old doctor in Hong Kong.\nIn the case of Covid-19, it may not be possible to find the first patient of all, but that may also not be very important or even desirable, even at the risk of being misleading. Officially, there is still no pandemic but a series of epidemics around the world. It will be more relevant in the immediate future to seek out patient zero in each of them.\nIn Italy, for example, this seems to have already happened. El Mundo now says that patient zero of Covid-19 in the country is a 38-year-old man and is receiving a cocktail of medicines where one is commonly used to treat HIV.'

'888888,0,A similar situation was seen during the 2014 Ebola epidemic a health crisis of global reach appears, with great uncertainty about how it will evolve, causing concern in society. A perfect breeding ground to appear hoaxes, misinformation and distrust the health authorities. Six years ago mistakes were made in the government\'s communication by Spain to be remedied by making the front of Fernando Simon, director of the Coordination Center Alerts and Health Emergencies, which today is responsible for reporting the evolution of the coronavirus. But then the scenario of spreading lies and half-truths was not as complex as today.\nA good example is what happened on Thursday and Friday with a statement of the renowned doctor Pedro Cavadas to the Public Mirror program of Antena 3. Cavadas is surgeon, not an expert on viruses or epidemics, but said, referring to the Chinese authorities: "If you recognize a number of dead and infected, eh, you do not need to be very clever to think that there are ten or a hundred times more." The alarming message of this video is massively spread through social networks like WhatsApp and Facebook, and later many media collected these statements and spread among its readers. A margin of the intentions of the doctor, who would certainly be good, it seems the voice indicated to report on this outbreak.\n"In this case, several things come together, because Cavadas has great prestige and authority in his field and among the public, but at times like this we must be very careful with what they say, especially if you\'re not an expert and no accounts direct information, "says Carolina Moreno, professor at the University of Valencia and expert in scientific and medical misinformation. "It\'s an opinion, but people do not take it as an opinion more because it is a highly respected physician, and does not help strengthen confidence in the authorities, so necessary in these cases," he adds. Disinformation is not all malicious or deliberate.\nThe coordinator of the initiative #SaludSinBulos, Carlos Mateos, believes that in situations like the present, with 19 Spaniards returning from the area affected by the virus, no speculation should be disseminated. "And if you speculate missing, other persons or institutions with expertise in the subject, which is reference in the field. If anyone should doubt the opacity of China, which is the perfect seed for disinformation, who are experts, workers field or WHO itself, "he says.\nMateos has identified numerous hoaxes that are circulating through all kinds of channels since the outbreak of the crisis in the media. Especially those related images difficult to locate, but high impact. "We must be cautious, wary of someone who appears with mask, for example, which can be anywhere or any year. However, spread very easily and very fast," laments Mateos, vice president of the Association of Researchers in eHealth.\nEspecially hoaxes have circulated and misinformation with an origin outside Spain, encouraging all kinds of conspiracies about the cause, the motives and the "hidden truth" about the outbreak. But with the repatriation of Spanish from Wuhan they appear many more Spanish invoice, according Mateos, giving the appearance of closeness to the hospital or returned. For example, on the platform of fact-checking Maldita.es have disproved a canard that ran through mobile which ensures that the "Ministry of Health" (in Spain is the Ministry of Health) has issued a "notice of emergency" in which reports that "the outbreak of coronavirus this time is very serious and deadly". all false. In his last appearance, Fernando Simon said that "the epidemic is likely to begin to subside soon."\nIn addition to the press conferences is giving Simon the Ministry of Health has agreed with the platform Twitter to refer to its official account when users view on this matter. To avoid confusion, experts ask you deal only voices authorized or official accounts of agencies involved. Otherwise, noise can cause confusion and distrust the management of the epidemic.\nTwo days ago, the country secured in its editorial that "we must therefore keep a vigilant watch, but without falling into alarmism that may aggravate the inherent damage to an epidemic of this nature." In the same way, The New York Times warned in an editorial that distrust of science and institutions can be a serious problem if the worsening outbreak: "Another major problem is the lack of public trust: the measures of control only work if people follow them. And it\'s much less likely that people follow orders when they do not trust the authorities. " And he remembers again the case of ebola: "Trust can be as important as technology and financial resources to keep at bay the outbreak of coronavirus, as they learned workers in global health during outbreaks recent Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ".\nJavier@esmateria.com can write to us or follow STUFF on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or subscribe to our newsletter here.'

'888888,0,With the ongoing clinical review, concern about the new coronavirus remains on the agenda, even though the World Health Organisation considers that "this is not the time to declare the situation a global emergency". The outbreak is being followed closely and with apprehension, but the number of cases outside China is considered low. On the contrary, it increases the list of countries taking preventive measures and preparing for the possible need to deal with the disease.\nFrom China, country of origin of 2019-nCoV, news comes from more confined cities. After the quarantine imposed since Thursday on Wuhan, the focus of the infection, authorities ordered the isolation of four other nearby locations, extreme measure to try to control the transmission of the virus. On the list of cities closed to the outside are now Huanggang, with 7,5 million inhabitants, and three other smaller towns: Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang. The decision means that 21 million inhabitants are currently isolated.\nAt the end of this Thursday afternoon, the most recent data set the numbers at 18 deaths (mainly men) and 634 infected. New cases are expected, but it is difficult to anticipate at what rate and quantity.\nThe 18th death brought a novelty, since it was notified in China, but by the authorities of the province of Hebei, that is, outside Wuhan. Beyond the Chinese borders, the virus reached Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and the United States, with echoes from Scotland about the possibility of four infected people, and in Canada several others being under medical surveillance, for showing signs of the disease.\nThis Thursday was also the day the European Centre for Disease Control raised the risk of coronavirus infection in the European Union (EU) to\'moderate\'.\nYeah. This represents a "small increase" in relation to the risk assessment made by the same body last week, and, as explained, comes in the follow-up to "confirmation of transmission from human to human".\nWith two patients placed in isolation and considered high-risk cases, Macao decided to cancel the Lunar New Year celebrations, while Hong Kong transformed two holiday camps into quarantine zones, aimed at people who had made contact with carriers of the new coronavirus.\nThe flow of Chinese tourists taking vacations on Lunar New Year is an increased concern, which has led several airports around the world to take specific precautions.\nOn another level, experts are looking for a better understanding of the virus they\'re dealing with. A first study published this Tuesday in the Science China Life Sciences magazine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed the relationship between the new coronavirus and the like.

'888888,0,The European Union economy will shrink this year, according to the Commission\'s assessment, due to the Coronavirus crisis.\nInitially, growth was expected to be 1,4 per cent for 2020; now growth will "fall below zero, possibly even significantly," said a senior Commission official in Brussels on Friday.\nAccording to information from the German Press Agency, the Commission is based on two assumptions: that the Coronavirus epidemic will spread evenly over time to all EU countries and will remain at approximately the same rates of disease and death; and that the economic impact on the labour market and demand is stronger in some sectors than in China.\nThe Brussels authority expects impact on the economy from various trends in the new Covid-19 disease. Thus, the European economy will suffer from the economic shock in China in the first quarter, there will be supply bottlenecks for the European and global economies, demand will also be dampened across Europe and globally, and liquidity bottlenecks for businesses are to be expected.\nStrictly speaking, the Covid-19 crisis will have a very large negative impact on the economy in the EU and the euro area, the Commission estimates. 2021 The economy will experience a substantial but not complete recovery. However, some of the direct negative consequences could be mitigated by swift and effective counter-measures taken by the EU and the Member States, according to an analysis by the Commission.\nThe EU Commission is planning a comprehensive package for this.

'888888,0,KUALA LUMPUR (BERNAMA) – The Philippines may postpone the 10th ASEAN Para Games (APG) for a second time due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare.The Philippine Sports Commission (PSC) has recommended to the Philippine Paralympic Committee (PPC) to reschedule the APG to a later date, after postponing the biennial Games from January to March 20-28, due to financial and logistical constraints.“PSC-managed events such as the National Sports Summit 2020, Philippine National Games, Children’s Games, Batang Pinoy (Philippine Youth Games) and other activities have been postponed indefinitely as a security measure in light of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.“The sports agency also gave its formal recommendation to postpone the 2020 APG, considering the said health crisis. This was officially announced during the press conference at Rizal Memorial Coliseum, Manila,” stated the advisory posted on PSC’s Facebook page.CNN Philippines reported that the final decision, however, would be taken by the PPC as its President Mike Barredo is to consult with the ASEAN Para Sports Federation (APSF) in Bangkok, Thailand today to discuss the actions to be taken, probably postponing the APG to May or June.The Philippine government has already banned all visitors from China, Hong Kong and Macau due to the outbreak.The death toll has risen to over 560, while more than 28,000, the vast majority in China, have been infected by the deadly virus.In Malaysia, 14 people, including 10 Chinese nationals have been found positive for the virus.\n'
'888888,0,The Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus, reported just one confirmed case on Monday as the deadly COVID-19 gradually abated but 13 people died in the country taking the death toll so far to 3,226, Chinese health officials said on Tuesday.\n\nWuhan along with the entire Hubei province with over 50 million people was kept under total lockdown since January 23 banning all movement of transportation after the virus first emerged in December.\nThe Chinese city of Wuhan reported one new confirmed case of the COVID-19 and 12 deaths on Monday, the provincial health commission said on Tuesday.\nThe latest report brought the total confirmed cases of the virus in the Hubei province to 67,799.\nAmong the 8,004 hospitalised patients, 2,243 were still in severe condition and another 539 in critical condition, it said.\nAs the virus began to abate in its worst affected areas, Wuhan and Hubei province, China on Monday announced plans for an orderly withdrawal of thousands of medical staff deployed there while a top medical expert said the coronavirus outbreak has "almost seen its end" in the country but a final judgement would be made after a month.\nChina\'s National Health Commission said 21 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus infection and 13 deaths were reported on the Chinese mainland on Monday.\nOf the deaths, 12 were in Hubei province and one in Shaanxi province, it said.\nMeanwhile, 45 new suspected cases were reported, the commission said.\nThe overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 80,881 by the end of Monday.\nThis includes 3,226 people who died of the disease, 8,976 patients who were still being treated, 68,679 others discharged after recovery.\nThe commission said that 128 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.\nMeanwhile, 20 imported cases were reported on the mainland on Monday taking the total to 143. Beijing reported nine imported cases.\nAs of Monday, 157 confirmed cases, including four deaths, have been reported in Hong Kong, 11 confirmed cases in the Macao SAR, and 67 in Taiwan including one death.\nThe virus that first emerged in China\'s Wuhan city in the Hubei province in December last year has spread to 155 countries, infected 182,405 people and has claimed 7,154 lives, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus tracker.\nA leading Chinese official group, headed by Premier Li Keqiang, suggested orderly withdrawal of the medical staff supporting virus-hit Hubei province for which Wuhan is the capital.\nChina deployed over 30,000 medical personnel, including staff from the military, and built 14 makeshift hospitals at the height of the coronavirus outbreak in January.\nThe makeshift hospitals have been dismantled.\nThe leading group asked officials to ensure high-level treatment of severe COVID-19 patients in Wuhan while withdrawing the supporting medical teams, state-run China Daily reported.\nMeanwhile, Cao Wei, deputy director and associate chief ;physician of the department of infectious diseases of Peking Union Medical College hospital, said the deadly coronavirus which brought China to a grinding halt for about three months has "almost seen its end".\n"Currently, after three months of the fight, the (virus) outbreak in China, which started in last December has almost seen its end," said Cao.\n"We will still wait for another month to see and make the final judgement," Cao, who was in Wuhan directing mammoth medical operations to fight the disease, told an online media briefing.\nShe also said that no data has been found to indicate the relationship between the novel coronavirus and the weather.\n"We all know WHO declared it as a pandemic a few days ago. It means the situation globally will not solely depend on China or any other single county," Cao told online media briefing from Wuhan adding that China would take a call on it in about a month.\nAsked whether China apprehends a second wave of the virus, she said the relapse of the COVID-19 epidemic in China "would not be a great concern under the current prevention and control measures."\nShe said the number of newly reported cases of coronavirus in the country, including imported ones might stay at a relatively low level, but it would last for a certain period of time as the imported cases have become an important source of COVID-19.\nCao also said there is no evidence to show that the virus would abate with the onset of summer and the resultant rise in temperatures, ruling out the prevailing view that summer heat would subdue the virus.\nThere is no data about COVID-19 relevance to the weather pattern.\n"The impact of the weather on COVID-19 has not been confirmed yet," Cao said.\n'
'888888,0,While China intensified measures to control the spread of the coronavirus of Wuhan, which has killed 56 people and infected more than 2,000 in this country will know something more about the nature of the pathogen. The bad news: the ability to spread of the virus seems to get stronger, as pointed Health Minister Ma Xiaowei, so the number of people affected will continue to grow in time. The good news: so far no Chinese scientists have detected clear signs of mutation (although do not rule out in the future). And they have already begun to develop a vaccine.\nIn a crowded press conference in central Beijing, where the vast majority of journalists were covered with protective masks, the minister acknowledged that he knows about the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV is still very limited. Unlike the virus causing SARS, with which it is related, it can be spread during incubation period -of one to 14 days-during which the carrier still no symptoms. Another difference from that epidemic of 2003 that left nearly 800 dead worldwide: then the infection took three or four months to become epidemic. This only ever needed a month. "Human beings adapt to the virus and get sick less. They also suit us, "noted the director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fu Gao, also present at the gathering.\nSo far, the virus has spread to 12 countries on four continents: the United States, Canada, France, Australia, Nepal, Korea South, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, totaling more than thirty cases. Tokyo said Sunday it had detected a new case, the fourth in its territory.\nSince the outbreak is not yet under control, China will continue to strengthen and adjust their control measures against the epidemic, the minister said, a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping, took the reins of the crisis and give orders spare no cost to resolve it. One key area will be the cancellation of mass events and limits on transport. The latter is especially important: after the holidays for the Lunar New Year is about to begin a wave of return trips, which can reach 400 million journeys and contribute to the spread of the virus.\nSo far, the Chinese government has chosen to enact a general extension of the holidays. For all, until Sunday 2 February. And for students, probably even more, although the exact dates back to the classroom at the time announced by the Ministry of Education, as indicated by state television CCTV.\nThe director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced Sunday that are traveling to Beijing to meet with Chinese officials and health experts. "We want to explore the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China to provide more protection against the outbreak," he said in a Twitter message. After two days of meetings last Friday, WHO avoided international emergency decree by the virus. The agency considered it "soon" to implement the plan.\nMore victims at the epicenter\nThe autonomous government of Hong Kong has announced that from Monday, prohibits the entrance to the city of people from Hubei Province, whose capital Wuhan, is the picentro of the outbreak. The veto affects people originating in Hubei and those who have visited the area in the last 14 days, although the Government has clarified that the restriction is not for their fellow countrymen, Reuters reports.\nThe mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, acknowledged at a news conference he expects the number of affected increase by a thousand more in their city in the coming days. Authorities are awaiting the results of the nearly 3,000 suspected cases have been detected in the city, as recorded EP. The mayor has emphasized the pressure that are suffering the infrastructure to respond to the coronavirus and announced the construction of a specialized hospital to treat patients infected in this city of 11 million people.\nSeveral large municipalities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have already announced that schools be extended at least two weeks the school holidays. The capital and tourist cities such as Xi\'an, or the whole province of Shandong, have suspended bus services long distance. To the extent possible, it is recommended to avoid displacement; transport companies return the cost of tickets without penalty. In railway stations, airports exchangers and temperature gauges and observation areas for possible suspected cases be installed.\nAdded to the quarantine blockades fifteen cities in Hubei, including Wuhan, the epicenter of the infection, these measures have reduced travel by 28.8% compared to previous seasons New Year, as revealed by Minister Transportation.\nIn addition to limiting the movement and close the area most affected part of efforts they will also engage in the treatment of those infected. Wuhan, where most patients are concentrated and has publicly acknowledged a shortage of protective medical supplies, will receive reinforcements of all kinds. It has already increased its hospital beds in 2300, and is expected in the coming days to have another 5,000 more. In the last 24 hours they have reached more than 2,000 healthcare professionals from the rest of the 30 Chinese provinces. Also they sent more than three million masks.\nOne of the big problems, he admitted the minister, it is the lack of protective suits. Wuhan each day, 11 million people need 10,000, and now, due to New Year holidays, the only factories are producing at 40% capacity. In order to complete the required number, it said Ma, will be used to reserves of the central government and the provinces, and will contact abroad to receive outside the quota missing.\nAuthorities are also trying to locate any resident of Wuhan who has left the city in the last two weeks. As he pointed out the mayor at his press conference, up to five million residents had left the city for the time quarantine, last Thursday at 10 am came into force. The wuhaneses who are outside should go to the nearest medical centers for a physical exam, and maintain a home quarantine for 14 days, as has urged Health Minister.\nThe governments of several countries have announced their intention to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan and other cities in quarantine. The United States plans to charter a plane on Tuesday to move back to its territory to 230 diplomats and other citizens. South Korea, Russia and France last -this, by bus to other cities have also indicated that they are in negotiations with the Chinese authorities for the release of their nationals. They were joined Sunday Japan, which has 700 compatriots in the area.'

'888888,0,GENEVA (AFP) - Keen to avoid stigmatising the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, or Chinese people, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is treading carefully on naming the new coronavirus. \n The UN health agency\'s official temporary name for the disease, which it has designated as a global health emergency, is "2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease". \n The date refers to when it was first identified on Dec 31, 2019 and "nCoV" stands for "novel coronavirus" - the family of viruses it belongs to. \n "We thought it was very important that we provide an interim name so that no location was associated with the name," Dr\xa0Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO\'s Emerging Diseases unit, told the agency\'s executive board on Friday (Feb 7). \n "I\'m sure you\'ve all seen many media reports that are still calling it using Wuhan or China and we wanted to ensure that there was no stigma," she said. \n The final decision on a name is expected within days and is up to the WHO itself as well as coronavirus experts on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). \n But picking a more specific name is fraught with dangers. \n Under a set of guidelines issued in 2015, WHO advises against using place names such as Ebola and Zika - where those diseases were first identified and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public imagination. \n Dr Sylvie Briand, head of WHO\'s Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, said this week that the use of a place name created "an unnecessary burden". \n More general names such as "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome" or "Spanish flu" are also to be avoided as they can stigmatise entire regions or ethnic groups\n. \n "It is the responsibility of us all to ensure that there is no stigma associated with this disease, and the unnecessary and unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable," said Dr Michael Ryan, head of WHO\'s Health Emergencies Programme. \n The WHO also points out that using animal species in the name can create confusion such as H1N1, which was popularly referred to as "swine flu". \n This had a major effect for the pork industry even though the disease was being spread by people rather than pigs. \n H1N1 was also sometimes also called Mexican flu "which was not very nice for Mexican people," Dr\xa0Briand said. \n People\'s names - usually the scientists who identified the disease - are also banned, as are "terms that incite undue fear" such as "unknown" or "fatal", the WHO said. \n "We\'ve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals," the WHO said in its guidelines. \n Instead, it recommended that any new name should be descriptive and include the causative pathogen if known, as well as being short and easy to pronounce. \n "We are really trying to be as neutral as possible, but as helpful as possible as well, because we need to name things with the same name everywhere in the world if we want to tackle the enemy in the same way," Dr\xa0Briand said.\n'

"888888,0,NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - The drug touted by United States President Donald Trump as a possible line of treatment against the coronavirus comes with severe warnings in China and can kill in dosages as small as 2g. \n China, where the deadly pathogen first emerged in December, recommended the decades-old malaria drug chloroquine to treat infected patients in guidelines issued in February after seeing encouraging results in clinical trials. But within days, it cautioned doctors and health officials about the drug's lethal side effects and rolled back its usage. \n This came after local media reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology study found that the drug can kill an adult dosed at just twice the daily amount recommended for treatment, which is 1g. \n As the drug has not been approved by the US Food And Drug Administration to treat the disease known as Covid-19, the Chinese experience may be useful as the American regulator studies the medication which has been endorsed by Mr Trump as well as Tesla\xa0chief executive officer Elon Musk. \n The pandemic, which has sickened more than 235,000 globally and killed over 9,800 people, has triggered growing anxiety across the US as states say they lack testing kits and medical equipment. California instituted a statewide lockdown on Thursday (March 19) to slow the outbreak. \n Chloroquine was among the first group of therapies Chinese scientists identified as being effective in curbing the new coronavirus. Clinical trials on about 130 patients demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce the severity of the illness and speed up virus clearance, according to China's Ministry of Sciences and Technology. \n Chloroquine phosphate was officially recommended on Feb 19 in the Covid-19 treatment guidelines published by China's National Health Commission, along with a few other drugs such as AbbVie Inc's Kaletra and flu drug arbidol as antiviral treatments for patients. The commission recommended no more than a 10-day course of chloroquine for adult patients at 500mg - half a gram - twice a day. \n As hundreds of clinical trials are launched to study potential Covid-19 treatments, stocks of drugmakers and biotechnology companies have racked up big gains on the hope that the industry will see a windfall. But the history of previous viral outbreaks like Ebola and Zika show little success in producing viable treatments. Some potential drugs were developed only after the epidemics already waned through containment measures. \n China's recommendation to use chloroquine in treatment was quickly followed by a warning. \n Two days after the treatment guideline update, the health authorities in Hubei province - China's worst-hit region, where the outbreak started and which accounted for the majority of its over 80,000 patients - asked hospitals to closely watch for, and immediately report, any adverse side effects of chloroquine phosphate, according to a report in local media outlet The Paper. \n The drug is known to have short-term side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and tinnitus, while long-term use can irreversibly impair eyesight. It is forbidden for pregnant women, as it can cause congenital defects in babies. \n The China Health Commission revised the dosage in a Feb 29 notice tightening chloroquine use. The drug cannot be given to pregnant women, those with heart disease, terminal liver and renal disease, retina and hearing loss and patients on antibiotics such as azithromycin and steroid. \n It can now be given only to patients between 18 and\xa065 years of age for a seven-day treatment course. Patients weighing over 50kg can take 500mg twice a day - the usual dose - while those weighing less will be administered the drug just once a day after two days of use, according to the latest guidelines. \n "
'888888,0,WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The Trump administration cut staff by more than two-thirds at a key U.S. public health agency operating inside China, as part of a larger rollback of U.S.-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has learned.\nMost of the reductions were made at the Beijing office of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and occurred over the past two years, according to public CDC documents viewed by Reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown.\nThe Atlanta-based CDC, America’s preeminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. It has worked in China for 30 years.\nThe CDC’s China headcount has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the documents show. The four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals.\nThe material  reviewed by Reuters shows a breakdown of how many American and local Chinese employees were assigned there. The documents are the CDC’s own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. Reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people.\n“The CDC office in Beijing is a shell of its former self,” said one of the people, a U.S. official who worked in China at the time of the drawdown.\nSeparately, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the global relief program which had a role in helping China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their Beijing offices on Trump’s watch. Before the closures, each office was staffed by a U.S. official. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA) transferred out of China in 2018 the manager of an animal disease monitoring program.\nReductions at the U.S. agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help China mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the U.S. government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. The Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to assist.\n“We had a large operation of experts in China who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,” said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of U.S. personnel. “You have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.”\nThe White House declined to comment or respond to questions from Reuters regarding the U.S withdrawal of staff in China.\nThe CDC did not respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters about the cuts. It has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the U.S. response to the coronavirus.\n“There are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,” the CDC said in a statement.\nSome health experts were skeptical that more CDC employees operating inside China would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. Beijing has been widely criticized for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.\n“The problem was China, not that we didn’t have CDC people in China,” said Scott McNabb, a former CDC epidemiologist who is now a research professor with Emory University. He pointed to China’s censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy.\nChina’s embassy in Washington, D.C. declined to comment.\nThe NSF closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman Robert Margetta. He said the agency planned on “sending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.”\nA USAID spokesman said the decision to shutter its Beijing office was “due to significantly decreased access to Chinese government officials as well as the Agency’s position that the Chinese model of development is not aligned with U.S. values and interests.”\nThe USDA confirmed that it moved a manager position out of Beijing. A spokesman said the department has retained an office in China that employs eight people: five Americans and three Chinese. The office monitors animal disease and helps resolve “trade-related issues as they occur at Chinese ports of entry,” the spokesman said.\nReuters first reported about changes to CDC staffing in China on Sunday. The news agency revealed that the Trump administration had eliminated the position of a U.S. trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nIn a press briefing on Sunday, Trump criticized the Reuters story as “100 percent wrong.” Yet the CDC acknowledged the position had been cut. The agency said the decision was made because of China’s “excellent technical capability,” and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the U.S. effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe CDC staffing documents newly reviewed by Reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in Beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost.\nThe documents show the breakdown between American and Chinese staffers. The number of so-called American “assignees” declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. Positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious diseases.\nThe biggest cuts were to positions filled by Chinese employees on the U.S. payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. Many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with Reuters.\n“Local staffers stayed even longer at the CDC and had a real depth of knowledge,” one of the people said. “There’s a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.”\nThe CDC told Reuters the three Americans currently on staff in China are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. A temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. In addition, two Chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training program, according to the statement.\nThe shuttered USAID and NSF offices in China also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation.\nUSAID’s Beijing office, which was staffed by a senior U.S. officer and two Chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. The office closed in 2019.\nThe NSF office was once led by Nancy Sung, a respected American scientist who was a key link between the U.S. and Chinese scientific communities, according to the U.S. government official who spoke with Reuters. The office also employed two local staffers.\n“She had far more contacts than most of us,” said the official, who had been in China at the time and was familiar with her role. “She could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.”\nSung, who is now with the NSF in the United States, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency’s public affairs office.\nThe changes came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has long complained that China has stolen millions of American jobs and intellectual property, charges the Chinese government has rejected as baseless. The countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other’s goods. Now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. Trump has called it the “Chinese virus” to keep the focus on China’s role in unleashing the pandemic. China, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to Italy and other hard-hit countries.\nOver the last two years, the White House has pushed U.S. agencies with a presence in China to de-fund programs there along with the positions to manage them, according to the U.S. official who spoke to Reuters.\nThe source said Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former Republican governor of Iowa, tried to remind the White House of the importance of the U.S. presence in China but was told to “get with the program” by an administration official.\n“The White House saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the U.S.,” the source said.\nA State Department spokesman said in a statement that the U.S. Embassy in China is “one of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement.”\n“Since Ambassador Branstad’s arrival, the U.S. Mission to China has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the American people,” the statement said. “Staffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.”\nAfter Reuters’ story about the elimination of the key CDC position in China ran on Sunday, Trump’s re-election campaign seized on it for fundraising. In a mass email to supporters, it accused Trump’s critics of “siding with the Chinese” and helping Beijing with a “cover-up.”\nThe CDC on Monday told Reuters that Redfield had decided to add a global health threats program director to its China staff.\n“At the request of Dr. Redfield, CDC is continuing to look long term at possible additions to enhance CDC’s 30 plus year presence in China,” the statement said.\n'

'888888,0,James KonVisitors from Hubei province in China, or anyone bearing a passport issued in Hubei, have been barred from entering Brunei Darussalam.Meanwhile, visitors who were in Hubei province within the last 14 days before arriving in Brunei Darussalam are also barred from entry into the country, with the exception of the citizens and permanent residents of Brunei Darussalam.Minister of Health Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohammad Isham bin Haji Jaafar made the announcement at a press conference at the Ministry of Health (MoH) building yesterday, as one of the measures taken against the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) by the Government of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam.The press conference was also joined by Minister of Primary Resources and Tourism Dato Seri Setia Awang Haji Ali bin Haji Apong and Minister of Education Dato Seri Setia Awang Haji Hamzah bin Haji Sulaiman.Anyone who has been to China within the past 14 days before arriving in Brunei Darussalam and allowed entry into the country is required to undergo self-isolation for 14 days.Brunei citizens and permanent residents who are currently in China are allowed to return to the country, but must undergo self-isolation within 14 days.Any citizens and permanent residents feeling unwell while still in China are urged to postpone their return trip to Brunei and to seek assistance with the Embassy of Brunei Darussalam in China, for further advice.The MoH will issue a travel advisory for the citizens and residents of Brunei Darussalam, which includes prohibiting travel to Hubei province and to postpone a non-essential trip to China.All travel to China related to the Government of His Majesty will be postponed; therefore, government staff and officials are advised not to visit China at present. Ministries, departments and government-linked companies are to postpone any invitations for Chinese visitors to the country.Cooperation from airline companies will be acquired to examine the passports of passengers during the check-in for flights to Brunei Darussalam. Anyone found to have been at Hubei province during the past 14 days will not be allowed to board the flight.Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohammad Isham said, “Currently, there are no cases of the coronavirus (2019 n-CoV) infection in Brunei Darussalam.”He also said the Ministry of Education (MoE) has adopted measures with regard to local students who have returned to Brunei Darussalam from China, by urging them to undergo 14 days of self-isolation.Meanwhile, 39 Hengyi staff members who have just returned from China are also undergoing 14 days of self-isolation.Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohammad Isham also revealed that 73 Bruneian students are studying in China, with only 31 students still there. Twenty-nine of the students are expected to return to Brunei Darussalam today. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will try to send the remaining two students back to Brunei Darussalam soon,” he said.Meanwhile Dato Seri Setia Awang Haji Hamzah said, “Students returning from China have been given a leave of absence for two weeks, to monitor their health. This was implemented last week, and was announced to all government, private and international schools.”Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohammad Isham also pointed out that “Brunei Darussalam is currently in the alert phase of this public health event. The risk of importation into Brunei Darussalam is considered high. Brunei Darussalam is operationally ready to deal with the potential for imported cases, using three-pronged approaches, namely: the prevention of imported cases, the early detection of cases through screening at points of entry, laboratory confirmation and clinical alertness, and response to cases through strict control measures such as isolation and quarantine.”He added, “Alhamdulillah, last week, we received the proper kits for identifying the coronavirus here. So we should be able to identify the virus within hours if there are any suspected cases.”On reinforcing screening at all border entry points, he said, “Cruise ships will also have thermal scanning on board, prior to the passengers’ departure. At the land borders, we will use the temperature hand gun, because thermal screening is very sensitive to environmental temperatures and therefore less effective. So we hope to cover all of the entry points.”When asked if there were any plans to restrict visas for Chinese visitors, he said, “With the ease of travelling around the world by flights, we are not restricting visas-on-arrival for Chinese visitors. As many countries have already been affected, our principle is that irrespective of their nationality, anyone from Hubei province or Wuhan will be barred from entering the country. Those who have been in contact with them will also be barred from entering the country.”The MoH will provide updates on the latest development, as well as measures that need to be taken.

'888888,0,BANGKOK — The coronavirus pandemic sweeping across the planet will force city authorities and planners to more seriously consider factors such as population density, technology, food security and inadequate housing, urban experts said. \n In response to the rising number of infections, countries have tightened border controls, imposed travel bans, locked down cities and stepped up surveillance using technology powered by artificial intelligence (AI). \n "It is likely that Covid-19 will prompt a rethink of urban design and planning in the Asia-Pacific region," said Dr Tony Matthews, a senior lecturer in urban and environmental planning at Australia\'s Griffith University. \n "There will probably be consideration of desirable population density levels, a greater utilisation of apps and smart data to track health trends, and many cities will probably start to think about their food security more closely," he said. \n Countries including China, South Korea and Singapore are using robots, drones and big data to track the outbreak, disinfect hospitals and deliver supplies. \n Such technologies may become a fixture in cities to flag potential problems for quicker response, said Dr Matthews. \n Authorities are also likely to more closely monitor vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever that are shifting due to climate change, and impose limits on the types and numbers of live animals in traditional markets, he said. \n Coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases — meaning they are passed from animals to humans — and the rapid pace of deforestation and urbanisation are major factors in the spread of these diseases in Asia, health experts say. \n Authorities in China said they would tighten supervision of traditional markets in the cities. \n CATALYSTS \n This would not be the first time that an epidemic has led to changes in city planning, research shows. \n The cholera outbreaks of the 1830s led to better sanitation in London and elsewhere, while the tuberculosis epidemic in New York in the early 20th century paved the way for improved public transit systems and housing regulations. \n The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003, which hit cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore, led Singapore to upgrade its medical infrastructure and create systems to map the disease. \n "Historically, epidemics have acted as catalysts in transforming how diseases are handled, especially in urban areas," said Dr Annie Wilkinson, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, a UK-based think tank. \n "Community engagement is key to effective epidemic control, be it delivering trusted messages, carrying out surveillance, or limiting movement," she said. \n In Singapore, which has among the fastest ageing populations in the world, engaging with older people was key as the coronavirus has a higher mortality rate among seniors. \n Singapore\'s Ministry of Health worked with community partners to ensure that essential services such as home-based care and transportation continued to reach seniors, a spokeswoman for the ministry said. \n More than 500 volunteers aim to visit about 27,000 seniors to keep them updated on the outbreak and address concerns, she said. Other service providers delivered meals and offered counselling. \n Such decentralisation of services may become more common in cities, said Dr Creighton Connolly, a senior lecturer at the University of Lincoln in England. \n "Decentralisation of services and reducing density are ways to combat disease spread, though this is contrary to sustainable transport and climate-change related goals," he said. \n "Also, very dense cities like Hong Kong and Singapore have contained the virus better than largely rural areas like Lombardy and Veneto in Italy. Ultimately, governance dimensions are more important than planning or design approaches," he said. \n FOOD SECURITY \n More than two-thirds of the global population is forecast to live in urban areas by 2050 — up from 56 per cent today, according to the United Nations. \n With cities battling worsening climate-change effects, planners also have to balance competing demands for land. \n China hurriedly built 16 makeshift hospitals in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, to handle the load. \n In Hong Kong, some public housing blocks were requisitioned for quarantine facilities, while in Italy authorities in Genoa are converting a ferry to a hospital boat. \n "Planners may consider leaving small parcels of strategic urban land available, in case temporary medical facilities or housing need to be set up," said Dr Matthews. \n Alongside, authorities will also need to consider the issue of food security amidst lockdowns and closed borders, he said. \n "Food security is a huge issue because cities don\'t tend to produce their food," he said. \n Singapore, which imports more than 90 per cent of its food, is encouraging more local production, for example. \n Some cities may create stockpiles, while others may try to produce more food locally through urban farming or through intensive growing facilities using hydroponics, Dr Matthews said. \n "But the bottom line is most cities rely on global supply lines for food and are therefore vulnerable to disruptions." \n Perhaps more importantly, planners will have to consider the impact of widening wealth inequality, with millions of homeless people and those living in slums at greater risk of contracting disease, said Dr Wilkinson. \n "Achieving longer-term changes in urban planning will depend on improving the way we see, understand and address health and living conditions in informal settlements," she said. \n "For many people living on the margins, crisis is already the norm and change is overdue."

'888888,0,Moscow, 19 - Russia News Agency, alfia yeknieva. Due to the popularity of covid-19, Moscow has taken restrictive measures: from Monday, students will study remotely and many adults will be transferred to remote jobs. How do we find a new coronavirus, how to treat it, why we need a simple quarantine, Russian News Agency reporter listened to the introduction of the consultant of the scientific work of the central Epidemiology Research Institute of the Russian Federal Health Supervision Bureau and the chief expert of the No. 2 infectious clinical hospital. Academician Victor maleev.\n-According to the latest information, 199 people in Russia have been infected with the new Colorado virus. Why quarantine if the official number of patients is small?\n-There are no more patients. We are not fully quarantined. This is a restrictive measure. If the number of new cases increases, measures must be strengthened. It is not allowed to go out of the house and produce. Everything will freeze. Therefore, efforts are being made to ensure that this does not happen.\nUnfortunately, the incidence is rising. Just a few days ago, we added three or four new patients, yesterday it was 30. Now, we\'re talking about it, but it could double in the morning. So we have to advance. There could be a fatal result soonAbout\n-The operating room just announced that the 79 year old woman died\nI saw her yesterday. She was complicated by a chronic illness. By the way, this patient is a good example of why isolation and isolation are needed. I mean, she didn\'t say she was abroad. Apparently, she has connections at home with people from Goa, India. Someone came to visit her - one was not quarantined in time. Unfortunately, this is already a local shift. The second mistake: she left too late. She should be sent to our infection hospital right away. She went to a clinic, and then in the second, and then she came to us.\nWe diagnosed covid-19 and started treatment, but the patient already had complications of chronic diseases. -- reported at the headquarters of disease control this afternoon, The patient died of a large number of bilateral thrombi and pulmonary arteries. - about. Red\n-How to treat covid-19 in Moscow hospital?\nWe use special antiviral drugs. There are instructions on how to treat specific coronaviruses. However, these data are provisional because they are regularly revised based on new infection data. We don\'t have much experience, including China\'s. Now I have the seventh version of the Chinese method that they usAbout\nWe also used some drugs that proved effective in the treatment of SARS, because these viruses are 90%. We must give the patients comprehensive intensive drugs. Therefore, if people with many related chronic diseases, such as heart disease, become ill, the heart will be strengthened so that the body can control the infection.\nYou mentioned SARS caused by SARS virus. Its full name is SARS CoV, and the new Colorado State is SARS cov-2. Can we say that this is the same thing in two versions?\n- No. This is a brand new virus. This is 90% of SARS CoV homology, which leads to SARS, but it is quite different. At least no new virus was found in the diagnosis of SARS. Some sars-cov-2 looks like mers, like SARS.\nCould a new coronavirus be artificial?\n- No. In order to produce a new virus, its prototype should not be just a variation)（ In other words, the difference between the RNA of a new virus and its predecessor must be considerable, and there must be many differences. It\'s impossible. Only nature can do this. We haven\'t fully studied its full capabilities: why it produces new viruses, where it hides themAbout As we all know, infections are cyclical: they happen, then disappear, and then reappear in a while. It\'s a time to return, and it\'s hard to predict if it\'s not a seasonal infection.\nFor example, SARS was discovered in 2002 at about the same time as the new Colorado virus: November. By the summer of 2003, he was gone. Since then, they have been looking for, they want to find a sick person, but not infected. Why? No one can understand. There are samples of SARS CoV virus isolated from patients and stored in a special laboratory without infection.\n-Will the new coronavirus disappear like SARS?\n-Who knows? This is unpredictable. It\'s like we can\'t predict if it\'s going to be seasonal. You know we\'re still in the same season for the time being. We should see what will happen next year, and then we can come to a conclusion. We didn\'t even know he would be in a while.\n-Information can be found on the Internet（ The average temperature there is about the same every year. Is that so?\n-No, because the countries that have found new diseases are in different parallel positions. For example, the situation in Chile and Italy is deteriorating, but they are not exactly the sameAbout\n-May we have a similar situation in Colorado virus in Italy?\nShe won\'t happen again. We must do everything possible to avoid that in the future. That\'s why preventive restrictions are being implemented in Moscow. Unfortunately, people are not always able to assess the level of the threat. So, at some point, the government has to take tough action. Then, of course, it can be criticized, although, in my opinion, it is praiseworthy. In any case, Russia - one of the few countries that has succeeded in borders with China over the years - is not letting new infections in.\nYou know, people often ask me: why do we have so few infected people? If China is nearby. My answer: the density of residents in China\'s border areas is lower than that in Russia and Europe. The main patient is still in Moscow. In the Far East and Siberia, there are no such big cities. There is no such thing as Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. All the patients found in various regions - such as Nizhny Novgorod, Akim - returned from abroad and passed through Moscow.\n-How fast is the coroner?\nFour to eight hoursAbout\nSo now patients\' biological samples are not sent to virus and Biotechnology Center vector "Novosibirsk"?\n-Now we have Colorado virus test systems everywhere. The analysis was carried out in Moscow before, but because it was the first time, they were considered suspicious, so the samples were sent to Novosibirsk for inspection. Now we only send suspicious results.\nDoes the covid-19 test require a hard filter? Now there have been complaints that doctors have refused to carry out such tests.\nThis makes sense because covid-19 is a medical procedure. Let\'s say there\'s no evidence for the X-rays and MRI that everyone wants to do - we don\'t have enough doctors or equipment. Most people don\'t need these studies. This is a similar situation. They were afraid and asked to do tests.\nThere\'s only one coroner that paramedics have to do. It\'s a procedure that includes bleeding, mucous membranes of the nose and throat. This needs some protection. If you doubt it, you can always call the hotline and tell them. Someone comes to you, maybe they\'ll analyze the biomaterials, maybe they won\'tAbout\nFirst of all, this analysis enables those who come back from abroad to contact them, even if they have no symptoms of coronavirus infection.\nIn addition, the new coronavirus has a sinister ability: it may appear in the body, it will disappear. What do I mean? For example, if the patient is seriously dry, he swallows a lot of things and breathes something, then the virus may not show up in the test. In the test, it already exists. Therefore, the analysis must be modified several times.\n-Excuse me, as an infected person, should the person who contacts with the infected person be fined for violating the quarantine?\nYes, of course. What are they doing? Infect others. Now, everyone is afraid of bacterial weapons, but these contacts, in fact, are real bacterial bombs. Because they work with the virus and spread it. Intentional HIV infection is a punishment. This is the same. People bring unhappiness to society, so they have to take responsibility for it. If we do not punish them, they will continue to act and we will not be able to stop the epidemic.\nYou see, it\'s very difficult to predict the spread of new infections now, because more cases of coronavirus will be brought to Russia 100%. We have 1800 tourists in MontenegroAbout There are Russians in Spain, Italy, some countries in Germany, where the epidemic situation is complex. This is the great potential of infection in our country. At present, we only have 10 cases of local Colorado virus transfer, people contact with foreign people. We all got them. Next, it all depends on people\'s consciousness, they will come back. If they stay isolated, see a doctor in time, call a hotline, and if other people don\'t like the Colorado River, we can deal with the epidemic. Now a lot of things depend on you and me'
'888888,0,Tass, March 16. Molecular biologists in China have found that a new coronavirus that causes the covid-19 pandemic can not only enter human cells through ACE2 receptors, But in other ways - by protein separation of CD147 molecules. The results of the scientists\' experiments are published in the biorxiv Electronic Science Library.\n"We all know that the virus enters the human body with ACE2 receptor. However, because it often appears in heart cells, kidney cells and sexual organs, The fight against the virus through this protein may have a negative impact on these organs. We have isolated receptors that are attacked by another virus molecule, which will expand the library of possible means to contain infection.\nSars-cov-2 virus causes pneumonia in China and other countries, and penetrates human body and other mammalian cells through ACE2 protein molecules, Covering lung cells. Scientists have long found that these larvae play an important role in the life activities of SARS, another dangerous virus, the pathogen of SARS.\nChinese scientists from Xi\'an fourth Medical University (Xi\'an) and Biotechnology Research Institute (Beijing) found that in order to enter human tissues and cells, covid-19 pathogen is a very likely hallucinogenic agent. Use at least another waAbout This is a CD147 protein receptor.\nScientists discovered the discovery, noting that the SARS virus uses these molecules when it enters human cells and other mammals. In addition, experts have found that these molecules play an important role in controlling other viral infections and malaria. In this spirit, Chinese experts used to inhibit CD147 activity and tried to use sars-cov-2 coronavirus to infect alveolar antibody culture.\nIt turns out that even relatively small concentrations of synthetic antibodies completely prevent the spread of the virus. Later, scientists observed the contaminated cells through an electron microscope, which confirmed that the virus\'s shell could fuse with CD147. These results show that scientists believe that the drugs developed to protect human beings from malaria and SARS can help prevent and control the sars-cov-2 epidemic.\nRussian federation\nThere are now more than 169000 registered worldwide. It is estimated that in 2001, there were about 6500 new cases of coronavirus infection. Dead, more than 77000 recovered Human beings. Diseases found outside China are in 148 countries, including Russia.\nAt the end of December, a new outbreak of coronavirus (covid-19) broke out in Wuhan, ChinaAbout The World Health Organization recognizes the spread of the disease around the world and calls covid-19 a pandemic.\nThe new type of coronavirus belongs to the same kind of virus as SARS and mers, i.e. SARS and the Middle East mycoplasma. In the past decade, these two viruses have claimed hundreds of lives in the Middle East and East Asia and have repeatedly caused epidemics, Spread through camels and poultry. According to scientists, bats are the original vectors of the 2019 ncov virus, and there is also evidence that this may be guilty.\n'

Separately, eastern Zhejiang province donated\xa0thousands of boxes of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in the European nation. \n In the phone call on Tuesday (March 10), Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the two nations\' friendship would see new progress as they work to tackle the fast-spreading virus. \n Mr Di Maio briefed on Italy\'s latest development on the epidemic prevention and control work, and thanked China for its support for Italy. \n Pointing out the severe situation in Italy at present, Mr Di Maio said the Italian government is paying close attention to and learning from China\'s successful experience in the battle against the virus, taking strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease. \n Italy is facing a shortage of medical supplies and equipment, said Mr Di Maio, expressing hopes that China would help resolve their urgent need. \n Overseas Chinese living in Italy have played an active role in the fight against the epidemic, said Mr Di Maio, adding that Italy will continue to take full care of their health and safety. \n Mr Wang said that as a good friend and comprehensive strategic partner of Italy, China fully understands the challenges Italy is confronting. \n The epidemic knows no border and is a common enemy of mankind, Mr Wang noted as he called for solidarity from the international community to combat the virus. \n Upholding the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, China is dedicated not only to making all-out efforts to keep the Chinese people safe and sound, but also to making contributions to global public health security, Mr Wang said. \n China recently made donations to the World Health Organisation to support international cooperation on the Covid-19 fight. China is also offering help within its capacity to countries where the epidemic situation is severe or where medical conditions are poor, Mr Wang said. \n Noting that the Chinese people will not forget Italy\'s support when China was facing its toughest moment in the fight against the virus, Mr Wang said China is now willing to stand firmly by the side of the Italian people. \n Though China itself at present still needs a large amount of medical materials, the country, overcoming the difficulties, will offer Italy with assistance like medical materials including face masks, and accelerate and enhance the exports of supplies and equipment to meet Italy\'s urgent need, Mr Wang said. \n If the Italian side requires, Mr Wang said, China would like to send medical personnel to Italy to help combat the novel coronavirus. \n The Chinese cities and provinces that enjoy friendship relations with their Italian peers, as well as Chinese enterprises, will also offer support and aid to Italy, the minister added. \n Mr Wang said he believes the joint battle against the coronavirus will help deepen bilateral relations between the two countries, and enhance the friendship between the two peoples. \n China appreciates that the Italian side has paid high attention to the health and safety of the Chinese nationals in Italy, and hopes that Italy will continue to offer them necessary help and support, the minister said. \n Hand in hand, China and Italy will prevail over the epidemic eventually, Mr Wang added. \n On Wednesday, China\'s eastern Zhejiang province sent 3.86 million pieces, or 4,556 boxes, of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in Italy. \n A cargo plane loaded with 26.4 tonnes of disposable masks, N95 medical masks, goggles, latex gloves and other protective clothing left the provincial capital of Hangzhou for Europe at 5.50am, Xinhua reported.\xa0 \n Zhejiang’s first batch of donations for overseas Chinese came from people from all walks of life in the province. More than 300,000 Chinese people from Zhejiang live in Italy.\xa0 \n “Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus, overseas Chinese of Zhejiang origin have tried every means to purchase epidemic prevention materials and support their hometown to fight the epidemic,” said Mr Zhang Weiren, vice-chairman of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.\xa0“Overseas Chinese are now in difficulty, and their relatives in the motherland should give them the utmost support." \n Due to the suspension of direct flights between China and Italy, the donations would arrive first in Liege, Belgium, and then be transferred to Italy, said Mr Gao Kaiyong, deputy chief of the general office of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. \n “If all goes well, the goods will arrive in Turin, Italy, this weekend,” \n '

'888888,0,JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has a significant deficit in hospital beds, medical staff and intensive care facilities as health experts warn that it is primed to become a new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data reviewed by Reuters.\nHealth experts say Indonesia faces a surge in coronavirus cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak in the world’s fourth most populous country.\nIndonesia has recorded 686 cases but the data is seen as understating the scale of infections because of a low rate of testing and a high mortality rate. Indonesia has reported 55 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia.\nA study by the London-based Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases released on Monday estimates that as few as 2% of Indonesia’s coronavirus infections have been reported. That would bring the true number to as many as 34,300, which is more than Iran.\nOther modellers are projecting that cases could rise to as many as 5 million in the capital, Jakarta, by the end of April under a worst-case scenario.\n“We have lost control, it has already spread everywhere,” Ascobat Gani, a public health economist told Reuters. “Maybe we will follow Wuhan or Italy. I think we are in the range of that”.\nThe government says the impact of the virus will not be that severe.\n“We won’t be like that,” said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, referring to comparisons with outbreaks in Italy and China.\n“What’s important is that we rally the people ... they have to keep their distance.”\nIndonesia’s health system compares poorly with those in other countries hit hard by the virus.\nThe country of more than 260 million people has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data. That is about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIn 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.\nYurianto said with proper social distancing measures there should not be a need for a large number of additional beds and that medical staffing was sufficient to tackle the virus.\nHowever, Budi Haryanto, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia, told Reuters: “The hospitals are not ready to support the potential cases. Treatment will be limited.”\nAlthough only hundreds of people have been hospitalised for coronavirus, doctors told Reuters the health system was already under strain. Many health staff lack protective equipment, with one doctor telling Reuters how she had to wear a raincoat because there were no coveralls available.\nIn a sign of poor infection controls in hospitals and clinics, eight doctors and one nurse have died from the  coronavirus, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association.\nIn Italy, where there have been 6,077 coronavirus deaths, 23 doctors have died.\nStaff at one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta had threatened not to come to work on Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment, another doctor told Reuters.\n“We bring our own masks, our own suits that may not be of standard quality,” the doctor told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n“My friends, one by one, catch the virus,” he said, holding back tears.\nThe government said this week it had sourced 175,000 new sets of protective equipment for medical staff that would be distributed across the country.\nA new emergency hospital has been opened in Jakarta with an eventual capacity to treat up to 24,000 patients. Doctors and medical staff have been promised bonuses and 500,000 rapid testing kits have arrived from China.\nIndonesia’s health system is highly decentralised, making it hard for the central government to coordinate its response across a sprawling archipelago of some 19,000 islands spanning 5,100 km.\nA lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds also worries experts, especially as the country enters peak dengue fever season, which adds to demand for the facilities.\n“If you are critically ill and you can get into ICU and get put on a ventilator, most people should survive,” said Archie Clements, a public health specialist from Perth’s Curtin University, referring to people infected with the coronavirus.\n“If you don’t get them into ICU and get them on a ventilator, then they will die.”\nA study in the Critical Care Medicine journal in January, which compared intensive care beds for adults in Asian countries using 2017 data,\xa0found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, among the lowest in the region.\n(This story corrects name of Budi Haryanto in paragraph 14)\n'

He discussed the possible actions and assistance provided by the international community to solve the situation that is happening in the country. To this end, Pizarro said: "at this stage, first of all, it is necessary to maintain the sense of urgency and seriousness of what is happening in Venezuela, where time is measured by life, not by hours. Understanding Venezuela\'s reality is a key factor in containing and correcting it, However, in order to support those who are fighting for change and make the Human Rights Council\'s efforts meaningful, he added: "collectively and continuously put pressure on mature Nicholas, not just sanctions, At the same time, under diplomatic and political pressure, Ambassador Maria farani of Brazil also expressed deep regret that "on Tuesday, Nicolas Maduro\'s illegal dictatorship did not allow the delegation of the Inter American Commission on human rights to enter Brazil".\nHe strongly condemned the act: "this is a clear manifestation of the dictatorship, and we are concerned about the alarming human rights situation. "It is often easier to deal with the consequences of this political crisis than with complex humanitarian emergencies, refugees and migration flows, but there is one reason: Nicholas Maduro and his regime, if we do not adhere to the goal of addressing the root causes of the problem, can change this crisis. In Venezuela, where we can spend years in these halls, we are going to fall into a vicious circle of no solutions, which we must maintain: finding solutions so that Venezuelans can freely decide their own future ".\n'

"888888,0,Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into the trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at the personal sacrifices made by healthcare workers at the frontline of Singapore’s fight against Covid-19. This is a shortened version of the full feature,\u200b which can be found here. \n SINGAPORE —\xa0Earlier this month, Dr Chng Woei was asked by her 24-year-old daughter if the family was not going to have dinner with the maternal grandparents until “this dies down”.\xa0\xa0 \n “This” refers to the Covid-19 crisis which has hit every continent except Antarctica, and has earlier this week been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.\xa0 \n And dinner with the elderly folks was out of the question till the situation improves, the general practitioner (GP) replied to her daughter.\xa0 \n The 51-year-old, who works at Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, would rather be safe than sorry. Since the clinic is a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC), a network of clinics providing subsidised treatment and medication during public health outbreaks, she could never be certain if the next patient she sees is a Covid-19 carrier, and her worst fear is that she may end up transmitting the virus to her parents who are in their 80s.\xa0 \n That is why she has restricted her family’s visits to her parents’ house to less than 30 minutes each time. Even then, they would not have dinner together, unlike before.\xa0 \n Dr Leong Choon Kit, 53, who runs Mission Medical Clinic in Serangoon, is keeping a distance of at least one metre from his loved ones, including his wife and teenage daughter. \n That means sleeping on a foldable mattress at night, while his wife takes the spot on the bed. And there are no hugs and kisses too, he added. \n Sacrifices such as these have become part and parcel of life for those working on the frontline in the fight against the highly contagious Covid-19 virus in Singapore, which has seen a total of 200 confirmed cases as of Friday (March 13). \n For more than a month now, frontline healthcare workers have been grappling with lost time with family members and disruptions to their personal routines and plans.\xa0 \n Many have to endure working long hours under a plasticky nursing gown, goggles that could fog up, an N95 mask so snugly-fitted that it could cause a headache over prolonged use, a shower cap and gloves.\xa0 \n They also have to deal with the mental strain of having to keep up with constantly changing standard operating protocols and definitions of suspect cases as the Covid-19 situation rapidly evolves. \n  Ms Ong Zh Hua, an assistant nurse clinician at Tan Tock Seng Hospital who works in both the screening centre and emergency department, writes her name on a gown that she wears as part of personal protective equipment (PPE). Healthcare workers wearing full PPE at the hospital sometimes write their names on their gowns to make it is easier to identify each other. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a senior doctor juggling duties between TTSH’s Emergency Department and the NCID, told TODAY that they are at “version 43” of their clinical protocol as of Thursday — just 50 days after the first Covid-19 case was announced here.\xa0 \n In recognition of their invaluable role, along with the sacrifices that come with it, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in Parliament on Feb 28 that public officers directly battling the disease will get a special bonus of up to one month, while a one-off Covid-19 grant will be given to 900 PHPCs, including more than 600 GP clinics, which had been activated to deal with the public health crisis.\xa0 \n As Singaporeans adjust to living with Covid-19, TODAY spoke to some 20 frontline workers to get a glimpse of how their lives had been upended by the pandemic.\xa0 \n MITIGATING RISK IN THE FAMILY \n In the initial days of the outbreak, when alarming numbers of reported deaths from China dominated the news daily and struck fear in the hearts of many, Dr Leong could sense from chat groups that many of his peers in the GP community were “very stressed out”.\xa0 \n One Sunday in early February, Dr Leong, who doubles up as a leader of a primary care network under the Ministry of Health (MOH), got a call from a fellow GP.\xa0 \n The caller asked Dr Leong to look after his young children should he die from the virus, and to explain to them how he died when they are older. \n “It is still early! Why are we talking about dying?” Dr Leong remembered saying in reply. \n Dr Philip Koh, 54, a GP with a Healthway Medical branch in Tampines, said a young doctor had also shared with him that for the first time, he had told his father “I love you”, just in case he dies from Covid-19. \n While such anxiety has since subsided as more scientific information of the virus emerges, some GPs today, especially those with young kids and elderly parents, still remain adamant about not taking chances in risking the lives of their loved ones. \n Among them is Dr Lee, a GP who goes beyond the MOH requirements to wear the full PPE for every single patient he sees.\xa0 \n Inevitably, his outfit had attracted the attention of some of his patients, said the doctor who declined to give his full name.\xa0 \n But the 35-year-old, who practises in an Aljunied clinic and works part-time as a locum, would explain to them that it is his way of protecting his two-year-old daughter who is also looked after by his parents who are entering their 70s.\xa0 \n “When I go to work, the first thing I care about is my daughter and my family. Although I care about my patients, my family comes first… I don’t want to infect them. If an elderly gets it, it becomes bad and can turn into an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) case,” said Dr Lee, whose wife is also a GP.\xa0 \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department. For Big Read on Covid-19 frontline healthcare workers. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n DEALING WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT UPFRONT\xa0 \n The full PPE is all the more necessary for him, as he had observed a trend of patients making false declarations that they had no respiratory symptoms at the front counter of the clinic, only to “ambush” him by coming clean to him about their runny nose, sore throat or cough in the consultation room. \n Typically, a clinic following PHPC guidelines would have triage staff segregating patients who better fit Covid-19 suspect case definition from other patients to minimise any cross-transmission. The process also ensures that the GP could be forewarned to don the PPE before seeing higher-risk patients.\xa0 \n Dr Lee got so irritated with such irresponsible behaviour that he decided to take a tally during a shift on March 5, and found that five out of the 20 patients he saw within a two-hour period were not upfront about their medical condition.\xa0 \n “It beats me why they don’t declare… They lie even when the triage staff warned them twice about the consequences of what might happen to them if they don’t declare,” said Dr Lee. \n “I put my life on the line to help, so I am asking the public to be more socially responsible.” \n MANPOWER SHORTAGES, FAMILY MEMBERS CHIPPING IN\xa0 \n Dr Clarence Yeo, from Killiney Medical Clinic in the River Valley area, had been working almost daily since February. He believes this would be “useful for the patients”, since MOH had advised that a patient should be reviewed by the same GP if they continued to develop symptoms after consulting one. \n The 47-year-old GP who sees an average of 50 to 60 patients daily — about half of them coming in with fever, flu or cough — said he will wait for the number of Covid-19 cases here to dwindle before considering taking leave. \n Asked when that might be, he said: “It is very hard to predict. We can’t say the next month, May, or June.”\xa0 \n Regardless, he is ready to put in the hours for as long as the outbreak drags on. \n In his second televised address to the nation on the Covid-19 situation on March 12, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the outbreak “will continue for some time — a year, and maybe longer”. \n GPs are not the only ones who are struggling with staffing woes. Manpower shortages and extra shifts are also common at restructured hospitals.\xa0 \n TTSH’s Dr Ng’s most memorable shift took place on Feb 5, the day after MOH announced Singapore’s first four cases of local transmission detected at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop at Cavan Road in Lavender. \n It happened to be his very first shift at NCID and an unexpected crowd of 300 worried individuals flocked to the screening centre to get checked for Covid-19, after MOH said it would be getting in touch with people who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland China. \n Dr Ng was the only senior doctor rostered with five junior doctors then.\xa0 \n “That was a very, very bad shift, but we survived because people came from all over to help,” said the 33-year-old.\xa0 \n Before he knew it, manpower was diverted from the team manning the Emergency Department. Two consultants, two registrars and a few more doctors arrived to help at short notice. \n And not once did he sense anyone having the attitude of “it is not my problem. I am not manning this post”. “They asked if I needed help even before I asked for help,” said Dr Ng. \n BEYOND N95-INFLICTED ‘BATTLE SCARS’\xa0 \n Now imagine having to deal with all these work contingencies while running around covered by a humid, overheated “shell”— the full PPE — amid muggy weather this past fortnight.\xa0 \n Indeed, the hospital frontline workers told TODAY it is common now to end their work day drenched in their own perspiration and dehydrated, as they were reluctant to drink more water, just in case they might need to “degown” often for toilet breaks.\xa0 \n Besides getting “battle scars”— facial imprints, pressure sores, abrasions and even blisters on their nose bridge left behind by prolonged N95 use — some frontline workers are also getting pimple outbreaks. \n  Mr Benjamin Ong, a senior staff nurse at the Department of Emergency Medicine at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, takes a selfie showing his facial marks, or what he calls “battle scars”, left behind by a N95 mask after a day’s work. Photo: Benzeemin/Instagram \n MORALE BOOSTERS \n With all the myriad of challenges, work days now seem to be longer for frontline healthcare workers.\xa0 \n The long shifts get more bearable these days, thanks to morale boosters coming in the form of food, presents and “thank you” notes from members of the public — a marked change from before when some healthcare workers donning their uniforms found themselves being ostracised in public.\xa0 \n The nurses and doctors said they are thankful for the chicken rice, nasi lemak, cookies, bubble tea, skin care products and flowers, among other things, that come their way.\xa0 \n But the gifts that take away all their fatigue are usually the extra special ones from their families. \n For TTSH’s Dr Ng, that pick-me-up came via a WhatsApp message during a hectic work day, sent to him from his son’s preschool teacher. It was a photo of his five-year-old holding up a drawing paper on which he wrote: “I love you. Thank you for saving Singapore.” \n "
'888888,0,The World Health Organisation (WHO) announced this Tuesday that the new coronavirus epidemic that has arisen in China is not yet a pandemic. "We are not currently in a pandemic situation", a term that applies to a global disease spreading situation, said Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO Global Preparation Department for Infectious Risks.\n"We are in an epidemic phase with multiple outbreaks," added the person responsible to the press. The term pandemic is used to describe situations where an infectious disease threatens many people simultaneously and around the world.\nSylvie Briand also emphasized that there is currently an "information epidemic", an infodemic that may make it difficult to respond to the coronavirus epidemic.\nWHO officials recalled that the birthplace of the epidemic was Hubei Province in central Cinha. "The transmission from man to man is intense and the Chinese authorities have taken measures" to limit the spread of the disease.\n"We hope that, based on these measures taken in Hubei, but also in other places where we have had cases, we can stop the transmission and get rid of the virus." It is a "challenge," he said. "I am not saying it is easy, but (...) we think it is possible."\nThe WHO leader also revealed that meetings are being held with representatives of the tourism sector to establish protection measures for those travelling.\nAfter declaring last Thursday the new coronavirus as an international public health emergency, which presupposes the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures, the WHO recalled that wearing masks does not fully protect against the virus, but added that those already infected should not dispense with their use.\nThe new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which emerged last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, has already caused 427 dead and infected more than 20.400 peopleYeah.\nIn addition to the mainland of China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more cases of infection confirmed in 23 other countries, according to the organization'
'888888,0,Beijing, January 23. /tass/ The governments of Hubei Province and Guangdong Province announced Thursday night that pneumonia is the biggest health threat, By a new type of Colorado virus 2019 ncov. Governments in these areas report that they are mobilizing all government departments to combat the disease.\nThis measure requires the mobilization of all staff, authorities and businesses and the use of all necessary materials and resources to deal with the threat. In order to prevent the spread of the disease, local governments have the right to cancel cultural and mass activities and stop the activities of enterprises and educational institutions, At the same time, access to potentially dangerous areas shall be restricted and houses, vehicles, equipment and other resources shall be temporarily expropriated.\nIn addition, local authorities have the right to restrict the freedom of movement and migration of residents and to take measures to carry out epidemiological examinations of people and various means of transport. 3. Isolate residents when they are suspected of carrying diseases\nAbout In addition, the government can mobilize the necessary units to ensure supply, stabilize prices and combat robbery. Take strict measures against such illegal acts as spreading rumors, arbitrarily raising prices, speculating and manufacturing fake products, "The cause of the deterioration of social order."\nThe number of new pneumonia cases in China caused by coronavirus 2019 ncov rose to 644 on Thursday night, with the death toll rising to 18. This is a message from the health and health committees in various regions of China.\nThe Russian Embassy in Beijing reported Thursday that the diplomatic mission has not received any requests or requests for assistance from Russian citizens in Wuhan. There is also no data on coronavirus 2019 ncov among Russian citizens living in China.\nThree cases are changing with each passing day.\n'
'888888,0,GENEVA - The World Health Organization played down media reports on Wednesday of "breakthrough" drugs being discovered to treat people infected with the new coronavirus, which is causing an epidemic in China and has spread to at least 20 other countries.  \n A Chinese TV report said researchers at Zhejiang University had found an effective drug for the virus, while Britain\'s Sky News said researchers had made a "significant breakthrough" in developing a vaccine. Oil prices jumped on the reports.  \n Asked about the reports, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: "There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety."  \n The process of developing and testing drugs or vaccines against a new pathogen normally takes many years and is often fraught with pitfalls and failures.  \n Even at the accelerated pace enabled by new technologies, the earliest that scientists hope to be able to start initial human trials of a new coronavirus vaccine is by June this year.  \n Doctors looking for ways to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus are likely to try antiviral medicines licensed for use against other viral infections to see if they might help, as well as potential antiviral drugs still in development.  \n The U.S. drugmaker Gilead says it has started clinical trials of patients in China infected with the new coronavirus, using an experimental drug called remdesivir, but stressed that this work is investigational at this stage.  \n "It is not approved anywhere globally," a Gilead spokesman told Reuters in Beijing.  \n Gilead said it had increased manufacturing of remdesivir to create a stockpile that might be used in future viral disease outbreaks. "We are doing this before knowing whether the drug is safe and effective to treat 2019-nCoV," the spokesman said. REUTERS\n'
'888888,0,According to the Hong Kong Ming Pao report, the U.S. expert model infers that the coronavirus kills 65 million people every year and a half, and the U.S. expert assumed the situation of the outbreak last October and expected it to spread around the world in six months.\nThe report points out that the infection of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus in Wuhan in China has attracted the attention of the international community to cope with the epidemic. An American expert passed the infectious disease model in October last year, assuming that once there is a small outbreak of the coronavirus, it will spread rapidly and kill 65 million people in 18 months. This model has attracted more attention recently. Experts involved in the simulation said that the model aims to reveal not only the impact of the epidemic on public health, but also the economic and social impact. Global public and private institutions need to strengthen cooperation in response.\n"I\'ve always believed that the virus most likely to trigger a new outbreak is the coronavirus," said Eric toner, a senior researcher in internal medicine and emergency medicine at the Johns Hopkins Center for health and safety on Friday\nThe report said that the Johns Hopkins Center for health and safety cooperated with the Gates Foundation and the world economic forum in October last year to conduct a simulation epidemic exercise, in which Tona also participated. In the event 201 exercise, 15 government, business and public health leaders participated in the exercise to make decisions in different policy options under the epidemic situation. The model assumes that a coronavirus named caps, which is more lethal than SARS, can spread easily like a cold, but no vaccine has been developed, and can spread rapidly to cause a global pandemic. According to the results of the exercise, the virus can spread all over the world in just six months; according to the exercise of 18event 201, the epidemic caused the suspension of flights, reducing the travel booking rate by 45%; the false information and false information spread on social networks; at the same time, it also caused the global financial crisis, with stock markets plummeting by 20-40% and world GDP shrinking by 11%.\nAccording to toner, when governments and private companies cannot adequately respond to the pandemic, they need to move towards international cooperation and consider how to produce and distribute vaccines at a global level, the report said. He said that cities are becoming more and more crowded, and people are invading the original space of wild animals, which has become the "epidemic era" of diseases. Tona has not completed an in-depth study of Wuhan pneumonia: "we do not know how it spread. The initial impression is that it is significantly milder than SARS, which is reassuring\n。 On the other hand, it may be easier to spread than SARS. "\nAccording to toner, who has erred in its refusal to identify "emergencies.".\nOn Thursday, the who rejected the announcement of Wuhan pneumonia as an "international public health emergency" on the grounds that there were few cases outside China, Mingbao reported. According to Tona, who may have made a mistake. Michael bociurkiw, a global affairs analyst who used to be a who contractor, also wrote on CNN yesterday that the who needs to take rapid action to promote coordination, strengthen surveillance and urge governments to take action by announcing "international public health emergencies".\n'
'888888,0,GUANGZHOU/GENEVA (REUTERS) - The coronavirus outbreak in China may be over by April, the country\'s senior medical adviser said on Tuesday (Feb 11), but deaths surpassed 1,000 and the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned of a global threat potentially worse than terrorism. \n The world must "wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one", WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters, adding the first vaccine is 18 months away. \n The disease caused by the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 is now officially named Covid-19. \n As the epidemic squeezed the world\'s second-biggest economy, Chinese firms struggled to get back to work after the extended Chinese New Year holiday, hundreds of them saying they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat. \n Company layoffs were beginning despite assurances by President Xi Jinping that widespread sackings would be avoided, as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured. \n China\'s foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Dr Zhong Nanshan, said numbers of new cases were falling in some provinces and forecast the epidemic would peak this month. \n "I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April," Dr Zhong, 83, an epidemiologist who played a role in combating an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome\xa0(Sars) in 2003, told Reuters. \n As of Tuesday, 1,110 people had died in China, where there were more than 42,700 cases. \n Only 319 cases have been confirmed in 24 other countries and territories outside mainland China, with two deaths: one in Hong Kong and the other in the Philippines. \n World stocks, which have\xa0seen rounds of selloffs because of the coronavirus\' impact on China\'s economy and ripple effects round the world, surged to new record highs on Dr Zhong\'s comments. \n Statistics from China indicate about 2 per cent\xa0of people infected with the new virus have died, and many had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly. But the spread of the virus, which causes fever, cough and breathing difficulties, has already caused widespread disruption. \n St\xa0Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said China\'s economy was expected to "slow noticeably" in the first quarter and anyone pricing assets should for now consider the "tail risk" that the outbreak could get worse. \n But Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the financial spillover from the outbreak looked containable, though it was still early to judge the economic impact. \n WHO\'s Dr Tedros was less sanguine about the coronavirus. \n "To be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, social and economic upheaval than any terrorist attack," he said. "It\'s the worst enemy you can imagine." \n The impact of travel curbs, lockdowns and production suspensions is being felt increasingly on China\'s economy. \n JPMorgan analysts downgraded forecasts for Chinese growth this quarter and Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy predicted the outbreak would cut growth in global oil demand by a quarter this year. \n Cisco Systems Inc, Facebook Inc, AT&T and Sprint Corp became the latest US technology companies to pull out of an international telecoms conference in Barcelona because of the outbreak. The organiser of the event, the telecoms industry\'s biggest annual gathering, will discuss whether to cancel it, an industry source said. \n Inside China, more than 300 companies are seeking bank loans totalling 57.4 billion yuan (S$11.4 billion) to help cope with the disruption, banking sources said. \n Prospective borrowers include food delivery giant Meituan Dianping, smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp and ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing Technology Co. \n Chinese firm Xinchao Media said on Monday it had laid off 500 people, or just over a tenth of its workforce, and restaurant chain Xibei said it was worried about how to pay its roughly 20,000 workers. \n The authorities said they would roll out measures to stabilise jobs. \n The World Bank ruled out any new health loans to China, though technical assistance would be offered. \n Hubei, where the flu-like virus emerged from a wildlife market in the provincial capital of Wuhan, remains in virtual lockdown, its stations and airports shut and roads blocked. But its health authority reported 2,097 new cases and 103 new deaths on Feb 10. \n With public anger rising, Hubei\'s government dismissed the provincial health commission\'s Communist Party boss\xa0Zhang Jin, and director Liu Yingzi, state media said. \n Washington, whose travel measures have offended Beijing, authorised the voluntary departure of US government employees and family members from Chinese-ruled Hong Kong "out of an abundance of caution", the State Department said. \n Dr Anne Schuchat, an official from the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said she hoped the first group of Americans evacuated from Wuhan could be released from their quarantine on Tuesday. \n Off Japan\'s port of Yokohama, the Diamond Princess cruise ship with 3,700 passengers and crew remained quarantined, with the number of confirmed cases at 135. \n Thailand said it had barred passengers from getting off another ship, Holland America Line\'s MS Westerdam, though no confirmed infections have been found on board. \n LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST \n '
'888888,0,London, 23 January. /tass/ Four people were tested for the 2019 ncov new coronavirus in Scotland. The three patients were in Edinburgh and one in Glasgow, the news agency reported Thursday.\nIn the past two weeks, these people have visited Wuhan City in Central China, Sky News reported, In December last year, an unknown outbreak of pneumonia occurred. They complained to doctors about breathing difficulties, which are one of the main symptoms of the disease caused by the virus. So far, however, no one has been found to have coronavirus.\nOn December 31, 2019, Chinese authorities informed the World Health Organization of the outbreak of unidentified pneumonia in Wuhan. On January 7, Chinese experts discovered the pathogen of a disease - Colorado virus 2019 ncov. People with weak immune systems, children and the elderly are at risk. They have symptoms like pneumonia and bronchitis.\nAccording to the latest data, the number of people newly infected with coronavirus in China has increased to 633. 17 people died.\n'
'888888,0,Berlin/Cologne (dpa/tmn) Germany has the first case of the Coronavirus. There is no reason to panic, says Oliver Witzke, director of the Infectiology Clinic and the West German Center for Infectiology of University Medicine Essen. "It was to be expected that we had individual cases in Germany. In this respect, it is pointless to worry about it."\nAnd yet there is some uncertainty-- am I at risk, do I have to protect myself? Overview of the main questions and answers:\nHow dangerous is the virus?\nMany medical facts about the new Coronavirus are still unclear: the rate of infection, for example, including aggression. The latter seems to be lower than for example in the Sars epidemic 2002/2003. "We are talking about a case in Germany that has been quickly identified," says Witzke. This is in no way in relation to the flu that is currently raging. "At which, every year, around 20.000 people die alone in Germany."\nDo I have to protect myself from infection?\nNo, and yes. Because even if there is no reason to be afraid of the Coronavirus in Germany, it makes sense to protect yourself from infectious diseases, especially in view of the current flu wave. Witzke therefore also recommends a flu control. It doesn\'t just protect you from the flu. This cannot be confused with lung disease.\nHow do I best protect myself?\nThe best remedy for infectious respiratory diseases, whether flu, coronary virus or cold, is hygiene. So much washing of hands, little shaking of hands, and careful sneezing and coughing. "If you can\'t suppress it, sneeze in your sleeves or elbows to protect the environment," jokes say. A respiratory mask is not a suitable protection measure for uninfected people. "Running away now and buying them would be a senseless panic reaction\n"\nWhere can I find more information?\nThe Robert Koch Institute and the Federal Centre for Health Education have published websites with answers to the most important questions. For telephone enquiries, the health insurance company Barmer has set up a free hotline (0800 84 84 111) to answer questions from all federal citizens around the clock, not just those of its own customers.\nWhen do I see a doctor?\nImportant to know: a snoring is not an alarm sign for a possible infection with the Coronavirus. Typical symptoms are dry cough, fever, fatigue, even shortness of breath. It is also clear that those who are ill should see a doctor.\nBut you shouldn\'t overdo it. "In situations like this, there is a danger that people who have nothing will suddenly be in the emergency room," Witzke says. This jeopardises the emergency system. "If you are worried about being infected with the Coronavirus for any reason, the emergency room is not the right point of contact, but the local health department."\n'
'888888,0,BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The number of new coronavirus infections in mainland China fell below 2,000 on Tuesday for the first time since January, although global experts warn it is still too early to say the outbreak is being contained.\nThe economic fallout from the epidemic spread to U.S. technology titan Apple, which warned of iPhone shortages and lower than expected revenue, while South Korea’s president called the situation in his country an economic emergency.\nTough restrictions on travel and movement have helped to limit the spread of the virus outside the epicenter in Hubei province, but at great cost to the Chinese economy and global business.\nApple Inc become the latest company to flag lower revenue as a result of the epidemic, saying it would not meet its guidance for the March quarter because of slower iPhone production and weaker demand in China.\nThe U.S. technology company’s manufacturing facilities in China had begun to reopen but they were ramping up more slowly than expected, and the resulting iPhone shortages would hit sales, it said in a statement to investors.\n“The health and well-being of every person who helps make these products possible is our paramount priority,” Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a statement released by Apple.\nChina is the world’s biggest market for smartphones and some analysts have estimated that the virus may slash demand for handsets by half in the first quarter in China.\nAnalysts at Nomura again downgraded their China first-quarter economic growth forecast, to 3%, half the pace in the fourth quarter, and said there was a risk it could be even weaker.\n“Too much damage has already been done and initial policy stimulus will not be very effective,” they said in a note on Monday. “China is experiencing the rare case of simultaneous demand and supply shocks.”\nSouth Korea President Moon Jae-in declared an economic emergency on Tuesday and promised measures to stimulate demand and shield businesses from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nHong Kong increased government handouts to businesses and the Hospital Authority to HK$28 billion ($3.6 billion) from HK$25 billion pledged previously, to ease the impact on the Chinese-ruled city’s battered economy.\nThe moves came after economic data released in Japan, the world’s third-largest economy, and regional finance and travel hub Singapore, pointed to possible recession in the coming quarter.\nChina’s state assets regulator said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on industries would mainly appear in February, suggesting the worst may still be to come in terms of business activity.\nThe rapidly spreading virus claimed another 98 lives in mainland China, bringing the total death toll there to 1,868, the National Health Commission said. There were 1,886 new confirmed infections for a total of 72,436.\nThe number of new daily infections in mainland China had not been below 2,000 since Jan. 30, while the daily death toll had not come under 100 since Feb. 11.\nOutside of China, there are 827 cases in 26 countries and regions and five deaths.\nChinese authorities say the stabilization in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.\nStill, the virus spread quickly and global health authorities had to remain on guard against a wider outbreak, said Jimmy Whitworth, professor of International Public Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n“We can hope that the reports of falling numbers of new cases in China does show that the epidemic has peaked in Hubei province, but it is still too early to be sure that this is so,” he said.\n“In the meantime health services in other countries need to remain vigilant to identify all cases and to prevent onward transmission to their populations.”\nWorld Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data “appear to show a decline in new cases”.\n“This trend must be interpreted very cautiously. Trends can change as new populations are affected,” he added.\nConfusion over virus information in China saw conflicting reports about the death of a top doctor in the Hubei capital Wuhan, with state media reporting he had died but family members saying he was still alive and fighting the disease.\nMore than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown to military bases in the United States, after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.\nAround half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess in Yokohama, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.\nGround crew in anti-contamination suits met a chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier. Those arriving were taken into a two-week quarantine.\nAlthough U.S. officials said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be taken, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were kept in isolation on the flights.\nSeveral other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home.

'888888,0,SINGAPORE: Since the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak was declared on Dec 31, 2019, Indonesia’s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Indonesia Country Office have been working in unison. \n They have also collaborated to strengthen response measures in anticipation of the coronavirus with the first public information release on Jan 8. \n INITIAL RESPONSE \n As the situation worsened in mid-Jan before the Lunar New Year holiday with the lockdown of specific cities in the Hubei province, Indonesian Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto announced that a budget had been allocated specifically to tackle the situation, ensuring that adequate training, logistics and standard operating procedures were provided or updated to anticipate the detection of positive cases. \n The ministry had also carried out webinars since Jan 24 to increase the awareness and detection of the 2019-nCoV across the public sectors including health agencies, laboratories, hospitals and environment agencies within local provincial government authorities. \n As part of containment efforts, the government had placed mobile containers designed to prevent containment on standby at major ports should they detect any passengers fitting the case definition and presenting with symptoms. These passengers will be transported in these containment units to pre-identified hospitals and treated appropriately. \n A public information portal has been established to provide daily updates on the situation. \n The public can also access information through their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages with the following hashtag: #WaspadaVirusCorona. \n The Ministry of Health, through the Bureau of Communication and Community Services and together with the Directorate of Health Promotion and Community Empowerment, has issued many risk communication materials and posters online and via media broadcasts. \n SCEPTICISM \n Buoyed by the confidence in his country’s preparations in handling the virus, Putranto declared on Jan 30 that "all (steps) have been taken to make sure that there is no outbreak (in Indonesia).” \n According to the latest reports on Feb 1, there are no detected cases in Indonesia reported yet. \n Sentiments among Indonesians and on social media, however, suggest some scepticism about these bold claims. \n One reason for this disbelief is the close links between Indonesia and China. The world’s second-largest economy is a major investor in Indonesia, which happens to be Southeast Asia’s largest economy. In the first half of 2019, Chinese investments in Indonesia reached US$2.3 billion, making up for 16.2 per cent of total foreign investment in the country. \n  \n These close links also suggest a strong presence of Chinese citizens in Indonesia. According to Statistics Indonesia, from January to November 2019, Chinese tourists to Indonesia numbered 1.92 million, forming 12.87 per cent of all incoming tourists into the country. \n At the time of Putranto’s statement, there was no restriction on Chinese travelling into Indonesia. The presence of many Chinese tourists made his claim that there will be no outbreak in the country incredulous, since it is impossible to detect Chinese tourists with latent or asymptomatic infections. \n As an anticipatory measure, the Ministry of Health had already tightened screening at airports and ports, especially for passengers who came from China. \n Indonesian Director-General of Disease Prevention and Control Dr Anung Sugihantono had earlier announced on Jan 27 that the Ministry of Health had stepped up alertness early to check the body temperature of passengers arriving from China via plane or ship with a thermal scanner arriving through all ports. \n Such measures may have given authorities the confidence that there was no need to restrict travellers from China into the country. \n URGENT MEASURES \n However, with the WHO declaring the virus an international emergency last Friday (Jan 31), the ground has shifted beneath Indonesia. \n On the same day that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirming that the global body had revised its risk assessment after crisis talks, in Indonesia more than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial complex in Sulawesi were quarantined in anticipation to reduce the risk of exposure to the community. \n That Friday, Indonesia also announced that it was preparing to evacuate\xa0nationals stranded in Wuhan with 238 people subsequently evacuated with four stating that they were comfortable with staying behind and three not being able to pass the screening to be fit to travel. \n The evacuated passengers, along with the flight crew, have been quarantined at a military facility on\xa0Natuna Besar Island, near the waters where the Indonesian navy had a standoff with Chinese vessels only last month over a territorial incursion incident. \n Although, on Feb 6, the authorities said they had\xa0yet to test those quarantined in Natuna for the virus as they are not showing any symptoms. The cost for carrying out tests can also be prohibitive, the health ministry noted. \n  \n On Feb 2, Indonesia also announced that it will temporarily stop flights to and from mainland China starting Wednesday (Feb 5) and bar visitors who have been in China for 14 days from entering or transiting in the country. \n Although there is no certainty that these efforts can stand up to the spread of an infectious disease, Indonesians should take comfort that its government is not ignoring the risks of an outbreak occurring. \n There is apprehension that detection may be lacking in Indonesia but the capabilities and capacity in the country’s health system are adequate to pick up any cases so there should be little reason to doubt their ability in this regard. \n "Indonesia has a functioning early warning system and 100 hospitals in various locations that serve as referral (centres)\xa0and can handle cases with proper measures as well as effective infection prevention,\xa0WHO representative for Indonesia, Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, told Indonesian media last week. \n KEEP CALM \n In the larger scheme of things, the response measures carried out by Indonesia’s health ministry thus far is in line with the escalation recommendations as outlined in WHO’s online course for the 2019-nCoV. \n The WHO Country Office for Indonesia had supported the government on technical issues such as risk communication materials, clinical guidelines and response measures recommendations. \n Moreover, based on WHO’s report thus far, patients with the 2019-nCoV infection may present a wide range of symptoms. \n Most seem to have mild symptoms, with only 20 per cent progressing to a severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases death. \n There may be reports of asymptomatic persons being infectious and would likely fuel the spread of the disease. However, most of these cases thus far had presented only mild symptoms despite being detected with severe viral infection. \n Given the high human traffic volume and trade between these countries, the novel coronavirus is likely to\xa0present itself in Indonesia in the near future. But the government has taken all the necessary steps to give the country a fighting chance against the epidemic. \n Qing Yuan Pang served as an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization in Bangladesh and had previously spent time in Indonesia working on disaster monitoring and analysis for the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Affairs (AHA Centre) and was extensively involved in the emergency efforts for the Central Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in 2018. \n '

"The first thing we have to understand when they arrive is the risk that they may have contracted an infection. If the risk is too small no action is taken," he said.\nResponding that the Portuguese authorities are always reviewing risk-based procedures, the Director-General for Health recalled the procedures adopted in the case of influenza A with the first cases that came from Mexico. "We asked people who came with asymptomatics, who may or may not be incubating the virus, to do voluntary social isolation," that is, to stay in a room alone and have minimal contact with people. But, he stressed, "the initial story is that it will determine the risk and in the light of that risk it is that measures are advised" of social isolation.\n"If the Portuguese have already been in their homes in Wuhan in the last 14 days, had no contact with people or animals, have been exposed to nothing, have no symptoms, there is no reason to place them in social isolation," said Archbishop FreitaYeah. For the head of the Portuguese health authority, these\'common sense measures should be taken\'. He also recalled that a person only goes to the hospital if they have symptoms. However, it was linked, the authorities keep in touch with these people to make sure they have no symptoms. "So far, the Portuguese protocol is thus and follows the guidelines of the World Health Organisation", he concluded.\nPortugal has activated public health devices due to the coronavirus from China and is alerted to St John\'s Hospital in Oporto, Curry Cabral and Stephania in Lisbon.\nIn Portugal, the protocols established for gender situations have been activated, by strengthening the Health Service\'s 24-Health Line, by means of number 8002424, and the medical support line, for screening and preventing people from filling hospital centres and emergency rooms in the event of possible contagion.\nSome countries, such as the United States, Japan, France, Germany and Portugal, are preparing with the Chinese authorities to withdraw their citizens from Wuhan, where there are also two dozen Portuguese.

'888888,0,(Repeats Feb 11 story with no changes in text)\nBEIJING, Feb 11 (Reuters) - China’s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country’s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing’s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters. Authorities have also reprimanded tech firms that gave free rein to online speech.\n“Xi Jinping has made it clear that he expects efforts to strengthen ‘the guidance of public opinion’ to be increased,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\n“We’ve already seen around 300 more journalists dispatched to Wuhan and surrounding areas to report on the outbreak. It’s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government’s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.”\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina’s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li’s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to “comment or speculate” on Li’s death, “do not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.”\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n“At the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,” she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for “spreading rumours” on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a “good online atmosphere” amid the country’s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on “harmful information and rumour” related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People’s Daily, “not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.”\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city’s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absence.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humour or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay. One phrase widely shared mocked how many Internet pages and content were now showing “server not found” or “404”.\n“404+404+404+404+404=2020,” said the shared post.

Five people, who indicated that they were feeling ill, were hospitalized on their arrival. Two were diagnosed with pneumonia, but it was not confirmed at this stage whether or not they had the new coronavirus, since the test results require time.\nThe Japanese authorities do not consider quarantining the returnees and asking them to remain in their homes for two weeks.\nA plane with North American 201 from the Chinese city at the center of the coronavirus outbreak also arrived this Wednesday at a Southern California military base after everyone on board passed a health screening test in Anchorage, where the aircraft stopped to refuel.

'888888,0,\nThe coronavirus (CoV) is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed four people in China is a novel strain not seen before.\nCommon symptoms of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) strain, which has infected more than 300 people since the outbreak in Wuhan in December, include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.\nIn more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death.\nAccording to the WHO, the CoV is a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\n"Initial available data indicates that the novel Coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) appears to cause less mortality than SARS CoV and MERS CoV. The disease manifestation ranges from asymptomatic to severe," G Arunkumar, director of the Manipal Institute of Virology, told PTI.\n"As per the available limited information, initial transmission appears to be zoonotic origin, though the source is yet be identified.

'888888,0,As global makers of household cleaners race to pitch their products as coronavirus killers, one major company, Reckitt Benckiser, may have a leg up on the competition.  \n The maker of Lysol and Dettol disinfectants said it has already obtained a strain of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, from an independent lab and plans to use the strain to test whether its products kill the virus.  \n Watchdogs in the United States and Europe stipulate that a product must be tested in a regulator-approved lab to prove it can be effective against 99.9% of a virus before it can make a virus-killing claim on its label or in ads. In 2012, for instance, when MERS-coronavirus was a major public health concern, cleaning products had to prove they could kill 9,999 out of 10,000 MERS-Coronavirus cells, according to the agencies’ requirement.  \n COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China, and has spread to more than 100 countries across the world.  \n The pandemic presents both a challenge and an opportunity for marketers of household brands to show how their products can help consumers deal with a frightening and fast-developing public health crisis. Doing it right could mean added market share; doing it badly will likely have other consequences.  \n "This coronavirus is the new hype," said Michael Reynen, the former research head of Procter & Gamble\'s surface care business in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  \n British consumer goods maker Reckitt told Reuters it procured a sample of the novel coronavirus strain a few days ago and will soon be testing its existing disinfectants for commercial use at a virology lab.  \n The lab, which Reckitt declined to name, is in the process of duplicating the virus samples to enable sufficient quantities for testing, it said. The lab can test six Reckitt Benckiser products per week, with results of the first batch expected by the end of April, the company said.  \n Before Reckitt can re-label and stock shelves with its Dettol disinfecting sprays and Lysol toilet cleaners, it must complete a battery of regulator-mandated tests that typically take at least six months. It could take over a year if they need to create entirely new coronavirus-killing products.  \n Reckitt’s move, which Reuters could not independently verify, could put some of its rivals on the back foot.  \n At stake are potentially billions of dollars in sales. Consumers spent nearly $22 billion on surface cleaners globally and another $1.43 billion on cleaning wipes in 2019. Clorox has about 4% percent and 37% percent of the surface cleaner and disinfecting wipes categories, respectively, followed by Reckitt, with share of 7.3% and 17.2%.  \n During public health emergencies, such as \'Bird flu,\' the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the 2013 MERS crisis, demand for surface cleaners and disinfecting wipes typically spikes, a Reuters analysis of Euromonitor data shows.  \n  \n \'RUSHING AROUND\'  \n Reynen, who held several top research roles in his 24 years at P&G, said companies can spend a few thousand dollars to buy aggressive virus strains like the novel coronavirus from regulator-approved microbiology laboratories, which mail the samples with a glycerin solution in small, deep-frozen vessels.  \n “Procter and Clorox will be rushing around to get a strain,” he said. “If they don\'t have it in their labs by now, I\'d expect they will in the next week or two.”  \n P&G, Clorox and Unilever declined to comment on whether they’re pursuing or have managed to get samples of the novel coronavirus.  \n The companies likely do not have labs sophisticated enough to complete the rigorous six-month testing for a virus as nasty as this, so they outsource most of the work to external labs approved by regulators, a process that could cost about $100,000-$200,000, Reynen said. The contracted labs typically work with top biomedical research organizations such as the private non-profit Institut Pasteur in Paris and the German government agency Robert Koch-Institut in Berlin.  \n As deaths and illnesses from the novel coronavirus mount, companies are resorting to the most powerful claims they can make. The U.S. EPA and European Chemicals Agency do allow for certain carefully-worded statements even in the absence of testing against a strain of the novel coronavirus.  \n For example, Lysol, P&G and Clorox recently created websites promoting awareness, claiming some of their disinfectant products "demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 Novel Coronavirus" and "can be used" against coronavirus on certain surfaces. P&G also put out a new line of sanitizing products called Microban 24 in late February with TV ads touting they were better than rival Lysol, but the company said the launch was not connected to the coronavirus outbreak.  \n Retail sales for Lysol wipes and rival Clorox wipes rose 184% in the week ended Feb. 29 versus last year, according to data firm Bloomreach. At the same time, shares of Reckitt, P&G and Clorox have outperformed the broader market, which has plunged since the first case of Coronavirus was detected in China on Dec. 31. REUTERS \n '
'888888,0,TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan on Friday vowed to step up testing and efforts to contain the spread of a new coronavirus after suffering its first death and finding new cases, including a doctor and at least one taxi driver, in different parts of the country.\nThe biggest cluster of coronavirus infections outside China is linked to a cruise liner quarantined in a Japanese port, with 218 people from the ship confirmed as infected and taken off to hospital.\nOn Friday, some of the ship’s passengers were allowed to disembark - with priority given to older passengers who have been confined to windowless cabins - to complete their quarantine on shore.\nNHK public television said a woman taxi driver on the southern island of Okinawa had tested positive for the virus, and the chances were high she had contact with passengers from the ship during a Feb. 1 port call.\nNHK also reported two new cases in Tokyo, both of whom had connections with a Tokyo taxi driver in his 70s whose infection was announced on Thursday. One of the new cases was a worker on a boat where the taxi driver held a party.\nA doctor at a hospital in Wakayama prefecture, where confirmed cases were being treated, had also tested positive and was in serious condition.\n“We will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves.\nJapan recorded its first death from the virus, and the third outside mainland China, on Thursday when authorities said a woman in her 80s had died.

How to do that is the question, we can’t lock things down as they did in Wuhan,” Oshitani said.\nOrganizers of the Tokyo Summer Olympics dismissed fears the virus would force the cancellation of the Games.\n“Advice that we have received externally from the WHO is that there is no case for any contingency plans of cancelling the Games or moving the Games,” John Coates, the International Olympic Committee’s coordination commission chief, told reporters.\nThe Olympics are due to start on July 24.\nEarlier, the first passengers left the Diamond Princess to be taken away in buses to complete their quarantine.\nThe alarm was first raised on the ship after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. Its quarantine is set to end on Feb. 19.\nThe ship, managed by Princess Cruise Lines and owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.\n'

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — Ms Sheryl Teo, 26, and her fiance Mr Bryan Cheong, 28, are not letting the Covid-19 outbreak stand in the way of a Valentine’s Day tradition they have maintained for four years. \n Ms Teo, who works in corporate communications, and Mr Cheong, a digital marketing executive, will be heading down to Tanjong Beach Club in Sentosa on Friday (Feb 14) night just as they initially planned. \n “Ever since our first Valentine’s Day together four years ago, we’ve been going to Sentosa beach for dinner and drinks to celebrate, and we planned to keep this tradition,” said Ms Teo. \n When they heard that Singapore’s first confirmed Covid-19 case was related to Sentosa, the pair discussed breaking this tradition to stay home and watch Netflix, but chose to wait and see before making a decision. A 66-year-old man from Wuhan, China tested positive to Covid-19 last month after staying at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa. \n A few weeks later, the couple felt confident in Singapore’s ability to keep Covid-19 in check, and chose to keep up their romantic tradition. \n “Our mindset is that, ironically, the places in Singapore right now with confirmed cases of the virus are actually the cleanest places, because so much effort has been spent to make sure that these places are now disinfected. So Sentosa is actually pretty ideal for us now,” Ms Teo said. \n Mr Cheong said: “Most Singaporeans my age that I know aren’t really bothered by the outbreak. We don’t wear facemasks when we head out, although we wash our hands more often.” \n Ms Teo added: “I guess going ahead with our Valentine’s Day plan is my way of actively choosing not to let the virus affect my life any further than it should.” \n In the same way, Mr Chua Kok Teng, 44, is undeterred by the Covid-19 outbreak from taking his wife out to dinner tonight. \n But instead of dining in a restaurant at Dempsey Hill or Tanjong Pagar like they usually do on Valentine’s Day, the couple will spend this year’s occasion supping on ma la hot pot at an open air eatery. \n “We have never had ma la together, so my wife chose a place near our home in Clementi,” said Mr Chua, who is an engineer in the oil and gas industry. The pair do not drive, and decided to eat close to where they live in order to avoid taking transport to town. \n Other couples whom TODAY spoke to also had the Covid-19 outbreak in the back of their minds when planning for their Valentine’s Day celebrations. \n For their first Valentine’s Day together, Ms Angie Ching, 22, a student at Singapore Institute of Management, and her boyfriend Mr Tan Jun Xiong, 23, will be taking a long bus ride instead of their originally-planned MRT trip to their dinner spot at Bendemeer, in a bid to minimise the number of people they come in close contact with. \n Ms Ching reasoned that a bus typically has fewer passengers than a train. \n The lovebirds also initially wanted to spend the entirety of Saturday together, but decided to just have lunch and a karaoke session that day instead. \n Ms Ching said she felt sad and upset when she first feared they would have to scrap their romantic evening, as the duo have barely had time to be alone with one another in the last month due to the Chinese New Year celebrations and Mr Tan working on weekdays. \n Now that they elected to continue with most of their plans since they believe the outbreak situation here is under control, Ms Ching said: “I feel excited but a little wary, because the virus is still here in Singapore, and we have to stay vigilant and extra careful.” \n Mr Tan, who is working as an accountant while waiting for his university term to start, told TODAY: “Life still goes on, as long as we take care of ourselves and take a little more precaution during this period of time, then there’s no need to make it seem as though the world has stopped.” \n “Also, it’s our first Valentine’s together, a day where couples celebrate their love for each other. Why would we want to miss this?” \n Another couple, Mr Gareth Yeo, 33, who works as an IT specialist, and his wife Ms Sharon Yu, 32, a nurse working in a general hospital ward, will be spending most of their Valentine’s Day at home, making popiah for lunch, catching an afternoon movie on the sofa and having a quiet dinner at a restaurant in Sembawang. \n However, the reason they chose to remain indoors was not out of fear they might catch Covid-19, but rather because they felt that Ms Yu needed some extra rest. \n After working almost non-stop for the past seven days as part of her shift schedule, Ms Yu said it was a coincidence that one of her off-days fell on Valentine’s Day, and it was the perfect opportunity for her to spend time with her husband. \n “When I’m on night shift, I don’t get to see him at all, because he comes home at 7.30pm and I leave at 7pm, and when I come back in the morning he is already off to work,” she said. \n Mr Yeo, who took a leave day on Friday to be with his wife, planned the whole day for them both. \n “It feels like she was gone for a very long time, and now she’s back. She’s been very focused on her work for the past few days, and she’s simply had no time for other activities besides sleep, work, and cooking some simple meals,” he said. \n “I think she deserves some time to unwind after having such hectic working days,” he added. \n One couple refused to let Covid-19 alter their Valentine’s Day arrangements at all. \n Mr Yuen, 60, and Mrs Yuen, 58, who wish to be known only by their surnames, said that while their Valentine’s Day plans were simple, they would still continue with them as planned. \n “I’m not overly concerned, we just have to make sure we take the necessary precautions. So we won’t have any changes in our plan,” said Mr Yuen, who works as group head of engagement and programs at the Centre for Fathering. \n The couple have been married for 31 years with three grown children, and will be going out on Saturday evening for vegan food, which they said they have been experimenting with recently. \n Mrs Yuen, who is a project manager, said: “We usually take time off and do dinner, but our objective is to connect with one another. We are not so concerned about the flowers and champagne.” \n “We believe that a relationship isn’t just about Valentine’s Day. If you make time for each other, every day can be Valentine’s Day,” she added. \n Mr Chua said: “Naturally I am very worried about the outbreak. But I guess ultimately if we stick to the basic rules for personal hygiene, there will be many couples who can just have their usual Valentine’s Day programme.” \n “At the end of the day, there’s never a 100 per cent guarantee that you will be safe, and you can only worry so much. I guess you just have to strike a balance.” \n \xa0 \n '

'888888,0,BANGKOK - Southeast Asian countries are cancelling or scaling back traditionally boisterous Buddhist New Year celebrations next month, citing the coronavirus pandemic as they call off water-soaked street parties and festivals.  \n The region usually hosts the world\'s biggest water fights in mid-April in which revellers splash each other under a scorching sun. Carnivals are held across the region, with pageants and dance parties as well as religious ceremonies.  \n Myanmar on Friday became the first to ban all mass gatherings to mark the Thingyan holiday – the most important event in the Theravada Buddhist year – over the fast-spreading coronavirus. Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand have also taken steps but have not introduced outright bans yet.  \n "Since the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is easily contracted in crowded spots, citizens are not allowed to participate in events, festivals and celebrations for Myanmar’s traditional water festival," Myanmar’s presidential office said in a statement.  \n All such events and festivals will be banned until the end of April and possibly longer, it said.  \n The Thai government has urged the public not to organise big festivals and water fights, but to celebrate more traditionally at home with their families, pouring water on elderly people to ask for blessings and offering alms to monks.  \n Bangkok, which typically closes off streets in April for water fights, has called off Songkran activities to reduce of risk of an outbreak. The city has also asked businesses and malls to not hold activities including water fights.  \n Siam Piwat, which operates popular malls like Siam Paragon, said they would have smaller events to celebrate the culture of Songkran and not draw large gatherings.  \n The beach resort town of Patong in Phuket Isalnd, famous for its nightlife, has also cancelled Songkran events, which usually includes musical performances and dances.  \n Thailand on Friday had a total of 75 coronavirus cases.  \n Neighbouring Cambodia cancelled celebrations in Siem Reap, where the first Cambodian was confirmed to have fallen ill with the virus on Saturday, and Laos urged citizens to avoid mass gatherings in a statement on Wednesday.  \n An official from Luang Prabang told Radio Free Asia all public events to mark the new year in the city had been called off.  \n "Only necessary traditional rituals will be allowed," the official said.  \n Despite close links with China, where the virus originated in Wuhan city, Southeast Asia has had fewer cases than other regions, though some fear they are going under-reported due to weak healthcare systems and lack of testing.  \n "It is difficult to predict what will happen in Myanmar, but the global situation is not good," Kaung Sithu, the organizer of one big annual new year party in the commercial capital of Yangon told Reuters by phone.  \n "Now is the time to be concerned, we do not want to be reckless and gather people."

'888888,0,NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD - India said on Saturday it was planning to turn some railway coaches into isolation wards for patients with coronavirus, as authorities scramble to prepare the country\'s health infrastructure for an expected surge in cases.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the country\'s 1.3 billion people this week to stay indoors for three weeks in the world\'s biggest lockdown, seeking to curb the spread of the illness. India\'s network of trains, the country\'s lifeblood, has been idled.  \n One train coach has been turned into a prototype quarantine facility, state-owned Indian Railways said in a statement on Saturday.  \n Once they get clearance, the plan is for each of India\'s railway zones to convert 10 coaches into such wards every week, the company added. Indian Railways has 16 zones, according to its website.  \n "Railways will offer clean, sanitised & hygienic surroundings for the patients to comfortably recover," tweeted railways minister Piyush Goyal. He did not specify how many people could be cared for in each coach.  \n India has reported 918 confirmed cases, including 19 deaths.  \n The lockdown measures are taking a huge toll on India\'s poor, including millions of migrant labourers whose jobs in cities have vanished. Many are now walking back to their villages or crowded bus stations in the hopes of finding rare transport, raising fears they will unintentionally spread the virus across India.  \n On Saturday, a migrant worker, who set out from New Delhi on a 270 kilometres (168 miles) walk to his hometown in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, collapsed and died, a police official said.  \n India\'s home ministry said in a statement on Saturday it was advising states to provide food and shelter to migrants at relief camps alongside highways.  \n  \n PAKISTAN SEEKS ARRESTS  \n Overall, the number of coronavirus cases in South Asia has risen to 2,648, including 39 deaths. Sri Lanka reported its first coronavirus death on Saturday, a 65-year-old diabetic tour guide.  \n While the toll in South Asia remains low overall, there are fears it could swell given the region\'s poor health services and population density.  \n In Pakistan, police on Saturday arrested 38 prayer leaders and mosque officials for violating a ban on congregational prayers even as cases swelled to over 1,400 in the country.  \n A plane carrying relief assistance and eight doctors from key ally China landed in Islamabad on Saturday, a Pakistani foreign ministry statement said.  \n "(They will) advise our health care specialists in the light of their experience and success in battling COVID-19 in China," the statement read. China has already given Islamabad testing kits, masks, protective gear and other medical equipment.  \n In Nepal, more than 600 European tourists were evacuated on charter flights on Saturday, authorities said, but thousands more are still waiting to be brought home by their countries.  \n "This will leave between 8,000 and 10,000 tourists still stranded due to lockdown in Nepal," said Dhananjay Regmi, the chief of Nepal\'s tourism board.

"888888,0,\nThough he landed in India with his wife Neha and no symptoms of coronavirus was found on them, they were still quarantined for 14 days at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police's quarantine facility in Chhawla, Haryana.\nAlong with Ashish there were other 76 Indians at the camp, apart from 23 Bangladeshis, one American national, two Chinese and four Myanmarese and five Maldivian citizens.\nThe life of a coronavirus patient can be described only in one word: Depression.\nThe patient is kept in isolation. He cannot talk to anyone. And even if you don't carry the coronavirus and are still quarantined as a suspect, you are sure shot going to go in depression.\nIf you don't have a phone or Internet access, then life will be even more of a hell.\nAs far as food is concerned, you can eat anything cooked at home.\nOur schedule at the ITBP outpost was that we had to get up at 6.30 am and between 7 and 8 am we used to get our morning tea. And then between 8.30 am and 9.30 am we used to get breakfast.\nAfter 9.30 am we used to go for medical check-up and that used to last for one hour. Our blood pressure and temperature were checked.\nBetween 12 noon and 1 pm we used to get lunch, after which we could go for a siesta.\nAt 3.30 pm we used to get either tea or some snacks depending on availability.\nAfter that we were free and in this free time we used to watch movies or chat with friends on the Internet as we were given wi-fi access. And between 8 and 9 pm we used to go for dinner.\nThis was our daily schedule.\nPaneer was a fixed food item on the menu for sure. Either we used to get mattar paneer, shahi paneer or mushroom paneer. And for lunch it used to be one vegetable or dal. The choice of vegetables changed every day.\nThe most fearsome thing was the testing of body temperature. One boy who was with us, his body temperature rose suddenly and so was immediately moved to the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi for three days.\nAll his tests were re-done at Safdarjung hospital and luckily it came out negative. The same was the case with all of us who came from Wuhan.\nWhat I have learnt from my stay at the ITBP camp is that the first precaution we should take is to keep away from any suspected patient.\nTo protect oneself one must use a mask to cover the mouth, and if you don't have a mask then keep a handkerchief.\nIf a person carrying coronavirus sneezes or coughs, if her/his spit falls on you then you will get infected.\nOne way to prevent this is if you drink morning tea then you can put ginger in it or kaali miri in it which makes your immune system strong. This can stop coronavirus from spreading to some extent as tea with ginger makes your immune system stronger.\nThe most dangerous way of spreading of coronavirus is metal. If a coronavirus patient holds a metal door handle the coronavirus attaches itself to it.\nCoronavirus can easily stay alive longer on any metal. Therefore, whenever you touch any metal object, then you must wash your hands instantly, use a sanitiser or wash your hands with soap. Train metal doors and handles are also very dangerous.\nThere is no vaccine to cure, but the HIV vaccine can help. There is no guarantee, but China has done so and managed to save some patients, I have learnt.\nThe worst part is that one patient can spread the virus to at least 10 people and those 10 people can in turn spread it to 100 and those 100 to another 1,000 and so on.\nTherefore, prevention is better than cure so ensure that you follow all precautions to avoid contacting coronavirus.\nWe were told by the ITBP that if any of us had been found positive, then all of us would have to stay in quarantine for 14 days more.\nWe all were very scared of this. If anyone sneezed by mistake then there used to be a fight. Because no one wanted to add another 14 days because of just one patient.\nThere were three South Indians who sneezed and they were taken away immediately. Again, thankfully, it was found out that it was because of the little weather change and therefore they were sneezing.\nAt the end of it we all became friends. We now have friends the world over right from Myanmar, Maldives to China because we were on that floor at the ITBP hospital.\nI am planning to go back to China at the end of April, to Beijing. I am not tense about it because life in Beijing is normal and I am getting scared in India.\nJust now, when I sat in the car, the driver saw us wearing maskS and he got scared because we had just come out of the ITBP hospital. We immediately took our masks off. If not, I felt he would have asked me a lot of questions about why we were wearing the maskS.\nI feel India is fully prepared to take on coronavirus. Right now I have come to know that at the ITBP camp there are 1,800 beds that have been made available.\nThere are Indians who are going to come from Iran and around 5,000 of them are coronavirus suspects. The government has made good arrangements to tackle this situation.\nAt the ITBP camp, doctors have arrived from different hospitals from every state of India. They saw our camp and saw what kind of systems are in place to tackle coronavirus.\nThey have got first-hand information and training on how to deal with suspected coronavirus cases. So I am sure India will handle the coronavirus situation well.\nToday I am leaving the ITBP centre and going back home, but I have been told by doctors that I must keep away from my ageing parents for 14 days because coronavirus is lethal for old people.\nI am happy that finally I will be out in the open air and breathe rather than live a quarantined life for nearly almost two months.\n"

At the same time, companies that have excess manpower can provide their workers with an opportunity to continue working in Singapore and save on repatriation costs,” it said. \n MOM and SBF will facilitate the transfer of Chinese work permit holders between companies in the same sector. \n Companies in the construction, process and marine sectors are already allowed to hire such workers before they exit Singapore. The latest move extends the scheme to manufacturing and service companies. \n SBF's chief executive officer Ho Meng Kit said: “This initiative will benefit all parties — companies that require additional workers to meet their business needs, companies that are looking to release their workers, and workers who find themselves displaced due to the Covid-19 outbreak.” \n Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, assistant director-general of the National Trades Union Congress, said that there are some small- and medium-sized enterprises that have a surplus of manpower now and other companies who have workers who are unable to return to China. \n “We are also mindful that some of these workers may still be paying off their loans, so this move would give them a chance to continue to work,” he added. \n The scheme is extended to all companies in the manufacturing and services sector, and not just to SBF members.\xa0 \n Interested companies can approach SBF and it will help employers looking to release their Chinese work permit holders connect with other employers who are experiencing a shortage of manpower.\xa0 \n Companies can only hire or transfer existing Chinese work permit holders within the same sector.\xa0 \n Should a connection be made, SBF will inform MOM and the hiring company can submit a work permit application to the ministry.\xa0 \n Mr Jack Wong, chief financial officer of engineering and skill training firm Wong Fong Industries, said that his company would ”definitely” be tapping\xa0the scheme, but said that he would still face the challenge of training new workers in a short span of time.\xa0 \n The firm has 13 Chinese work permit holders still in China, out of a total of close to 300 workers, who are primarily Chinese nationals and Malaysians. Though he cannot provide any figures, he told reporters on Tuesday that the company “does feel a drop” in production.\xa0 \n “(The scheme) helps in the overall management of the business. But of course, you will take some time to bring these (new) workers up to speed.”\xa0 \n He said that it can take at least three months to train a worker from the same industry, which would eat into the duration of the six-month scheme.\xa0 \n “Those from the same sector, if they are trained properly, they will need less (time to train), but there are certain skill sets they still need to conform to, such as safety.”\xa0 \n "
'888888,0,Eight more people have fallen victim to the new lung disease in China. Overall, 26 deaths have now been identified and the number of known infections with the Coronavirus has increased compared to 644 to 830 cases yesterday. German Health Minister Jens Spahn praised the information policy of the Chinese government in the ARD "Daily Topics". Unlike the Sars epidemic, which occurred 17-year ago, the international community\'s exchange works, and China too is more transparent than it was a few years ago.\n(dpa)\n'
'888888,0,On Monday (March 16), leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) announced a slew of measures to address the Covid-19 pandemic.\xa0The G7’s emphasis was distinctively on coordination and cooperation, with the measures covering information sharing, global economic relief, and public health. \n This can be seen as a lift for the multilateral system, amid the rise of divisive unilateralism among those who do not trust the global governance architecture.\xa0But the success of the G7’s actions will depend on how much the world trusts its capacity to handle the crisis. \n Indeed, if there is one word that encapsulates the governance challenge as Covid-19 wreaks havoc globally, it would be the word “trust”. \n Covid-19 has disrupted every aspect of life in affected countries, raised fears, and sparked uncertainties. Yet how people respond reduces to a crucial factor: Trust —\xa0or lack thereof —\xa0in their neighbours, their healthcare or welfare systems, and their authorities. \n When panic-buying or store runs broke out around the world, a familiar pattern played out over and over: People, facing uncertainty and fear, sought safety in stockpiling. \n Economists who study bank runs are familiar with this pattern: It illustrates an underlying logic of self-preservation amid uncertainty —\xa0and a lack of trust in the system to prevail. \n Yet individually-rational actions can lead to systemically-irrational outcomes, or in laymen’s terms: Panic. \n Making sure that a system is fit to meet people’s needs in a crisis —\xa0and then persuading them of such —\xa0must therefore be one of the major aspects of tackling the Covid-19 outbreak. \n DOMESTIC TRUST \n Leaders need stocks of legitimacy to be trusted in a crisis when so many unknowns abound, and they build these stocks outside of the crisis period. \n Approval of United States President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis follows partisan political lines. \n According to aggregate surveys by statistical website fivethirtyeight.com, between 10 and 16 per cent of Democrats trusted his handling of the crisis while 75 to 87 per cent of Republicans approved of it. \n Because Mr Trump domestically has only played to his base, non-Republicans simply did not trust him and a litany of his missteps were carefully documented, which will make it harder for him to carry out interventions that are needed. \n A leader who senses he lacks trust may also be overly concerned with optics rather than overcoming the situation. \n Experts also need stocks of legitimacy in order to be heeded.\xa0Unfortunately, this is not as obvious as it should be. \n Britain’s Brexit process had poisoned the well (the British public infamously had had enough of experts, according to British cabinet minister Michael Gove) and far too much of the population were eager to dismiss expert advice, especially when that advice would be disruptive to everyday life while the virus still appeared distant.\xa0 \n Put together, there has been a trust deficit that has hampered the effective addressing of the crisis. \n The turmoil on global stock markets suggests most firms and investors have no trust in the management of the outbreak in major industrialised economies and are pricing in for a hard recession. \n INTERNATIONAL TRUST \n International cooperation also requires trust —\xa0between countries and with international organisations. When the crisis in Wuhan unfolded in January, the US offered to send expert assistance but was rebuffed. One wonders if the reverse will hold true should the crisis escalate in the US and China offers its help. \n Countries have always devised foreign policies that support their domestic interests and public opinion but doing so is a delicate matter when it comes to close neighbours whose reactions also have domestic impact. \n When one country trusts that the other is handling a problem effectively, things are fine. \n But when that trust does not hold because of insufficient information, it may be forced to take preventive measures, even at economic cost to itself, if only to assuage domestic pressure. \n In the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan, several countries risked Chinese ire as they announced travel bans from China. Yet today, it is China that is now following this logic to place travel restrictions on other countries. \n Attempts to cover up cases, the slow rollout of testing (and thus lack of information), or ineffectual responses make it difficult for neighbours to trust that others have a handle on the situation. Lower trust —\xa0and therefore raised defences —\xa0will be inevitable until they come to grips with the situation. \n MULTILATERAL TRUST \n Multilateral cooperation had been brought to its lowest ebb just prior to the outbreak of the crisis. \n International organisations such as the World Trade Organisation are teetering on the verge of collapse, with its dispute settlement mechanism broken. \n The US-China trade war, which had only just begun to show signs of abating, had led many countries to hedge against both superpowers. \n Britain chose to go with Huawei in its 5G infrastructure against the US’ wishes, while erstwhile Chinese partners were reviewing infrastructure projects on the backs of debt and sustainability fears. A lack of trust in the multilateral system preceded the Covid-19 outbreak. \n On Covid-19, the World Health Organization was initially criticised in Asia for not declaring an emergency earlier in January, sparking a petition with half a million signatures. It did eventually declare an emergency on Jan 31, followed by a pandemic on March 11. \n However, the emergency declaration on Jan 31 seemed to be ignored by those outside Asia, and many countries are now paying the price for this. Yet one must ask why the WHO’s warning went unheeded: Did it have enough legitimacy and trust to be taken seriously immediately? \n REBUILDING FRACTURED TRUST \n Whatever the case, the pandemic is now upon all of us. National interests around the globe have converged over Covid-19 and will require multilateral cooperation to effectively address it, so the G7’s coming together is welcome, though only a first step. \n Countries large and small, rich and poor, all have the same interest: To quash this disease as quickly as possible. It is also fundamentally a public health issue that can, like pandemics before, be defeated without politicisation. \n We are now seeing demonstrable success in Singapore, China, and South Korea that have effectively nullified the domestic threat of the virus —\xa0they now appear most impacted by importing it from countries where the virus is still uncontrolled. They have managed systems that are effective and trusted to contain their outbreaks. \n While many countries still need to put domestic control measures in place urgently, this is also a rare opportunity to strengthen a troubled multilateral system and should not be wasted. \n  ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Dr Joel Ng is a research fellow with the Centre for Multilateralism Studies, S.

'888888,0,There\'s a new virus in the world, and the question we all ask is the same: when I come near us? The nCoV (acronym for "new coronavirus") was born thousands of kilometers of Latin America, a region remote: no city of the continent is among those that receive more visits from the Chinese provinces affected by a detailed study. And yet, Google searches on "coronavirus" have soared in recent days.\nIn all cases, the alarm is for a suspected case. Media and audience are (are) to hunt for the Latin American patient zero of the nCoV. We have already had several discards: one in the Tamaulipas border, another in Cali, another in northern Argentina, several in Brazil under study right now. Chances are that this case comes, sooner or later. Everything moves so fast that it is possible that when you read these lines already have among the owners of the newspaper. But what do you mean exactly? What it will mean for the region that have imported a respiratory virus still poorly understood?\nOur brain perceives better define the risks if dramatically. We need a character (the disease) and a drastic change in the course of events (daily routine) to alert ourselves. But rare disease sometimes behaves under this Hollywood script, however much we try hard to put it into the story. Take, for example, the influenza epidemic (swine) born in Mexico in April 2009. From week to week, the attention of the country (and the world) was overturned on four characters: H1N1. A sense of urgency was quickly caught, as if moved by electrical impulses, reflected for example in relevant Google searches. But the evolution of the epidemic was substantially more gradual.\nWhat\'s more: slowly, the scientific teams were distilling the real impact addition of the virus, imposing parallel containment measures and necessary response. In the end, it was a contagious disease, yes, and amazingly dangerous for younger (when flu tends to affect especially those over 65). But I did not mean catastrophe in mortality our minds wanted to dramatize: according to an estimate by the Center for Disease Control in the US, H1N1 killed about the same people as seasonal flu, staying below other pandemics last.\nOur brain, however, remains committed to find dramas and is in the seemingly cold numbers. One of these figures, which has captured the attention of the audience on social networks on the nCoV, is known as R0: the average people who become infected from another already infected with a disease. We had just a few weeks when several epidemiologists epidemic drew their estimates. Some clung to the highest figures, once again sounding the alarm messages from the "contagious coronavirus each affected by three people" style. But the truth is that these estimates were considerably variables. They always are: even with well-known diseases, the value of the R0 varies greatly according to the study.\nIt\'s just normal; to the end and Cape, a disease can behave very differently depending on the social context in which it develops. Not be the same a viral outbreak in a place without hygienic conditions and high population density, which in a sparsely populated rural area. That is why even the most contagious diseases, such as measles, offer wide ranges greatly contagion. Also, do not forget that averages can be misleading: if it turns out that the value of contagion from the nCoV in China is 2, this figure is so compatible with the idea of \u200b\u200ba thousand infected transmitting the virus to two people each, as the extreme scenario ten "super-contagiadores" affecting fifty people each one (because their work puts them in contact with many people, because there was still no insulation, or for other reasons) and other ninety-nine that contaminates less than one person per capita. While the first scenario would ensure an exponential spread in the second control of the virus it would be much easier once one identifies the conditions that favor the massive transmission. Between these two extremes there is a whole world of possibilities we do not know, and that will determine when and how will the nCoV Latin America.\nActually, what these numbers tell us is that uncertainty is an unavoidable aspect when we speak of epidemics. The drama is in fact a way to reduce it: if we have a clearly identifiable enemy, fear becomes certainty. But this same bias is what makes us belittle or ignore those risks to which we have become accustomed. Even when they are suffering a worrying rise.\nLet\'s talk, for example, the mentioned measles. In 2016 there were fewer than a hundred cases in the Americas. Two years later the figure had increased one hundred sixty: 16,000, recorded by WHO, mostly located in Brazil. Sao Paulo in 2019 recorded the first death from the disease in two decades. The lack of coverage of full and effective vaccination was the main cause.\nMalaria infected by mosquitoes in tropical areas, is otherwise return an adversary who never left the whole. But here the weight of the upturn corresponds to Venezuela, which captured more than half of the total cases in 2017.\nInterestingly, although both diseases have disproportionately drawn attention in the respective countries during the last half of 2019, both in Brazil and Venezuela look (measured by Google searches) turned quickly to the coronavirus in early 2020, confirming that nothing beats a good, new story of fear and uncertainty.\nThus, although follow our attention different logics, while certain diseases are greatly diminished or almost disappeared in the region (cholera is a good example of success), others remain with similar figures (tuberculosis: about 280,000 cases throughout the American continent year after year throughout the XXI century), as referenced above, even recover lost ground. When looking for causes, no simple answers. The mosquito-borne diseases are a good example. Several Venezuelan doctors on the ground have complained about the lack of fumigations led by the state that once served to decimate malaria. But spraying is not everything: as asked in its editorial of March 2016 the Journal of the National Institute of Health of Colombia, of the Zika (another virus infected bites) in Colombia and Brazil, do you really how cash is fumigated in places that do not meet sanitation (water, garbage collection) minimum? The director of the Institute for Health and Environment at the University of El Bosque, Victor Olano, pointing at a later issue of the same publication the need to ensure these minimum coverage in rural areas as a first line of fire against another disease still present on the continent : yellow fever.\nA similar reflection we can make in your day with nCoV: although it is likely that all the media attention focuses on the design of new drugs, measures basic control proliferation (early identification of cases with corresponding insulation) and maintenance healthy immune systems are the most effective strategies, but less spectacular. Similarly, the best way to prevent such epidemics flourish is to implement hygiene protocols in the treatment of animals by humans, something that the public authorities also have much to say and do.\nThe war against epidemics is not ultimately a matter of a single dramatic battle for the fate of mankind. It is neither the nCoV, as it was not the H1N1 (which, although diminished, still with us).\nThe moral is that, as the disseminator Swedish doctor Hans Rosling said, we must tame our thirst for drama and refocusing attention, effort, dedication to what can actually have a positive impact. In the case of infectious diseases, vaccines, protocols and sanitation infrastructure, research and response mechanisms exist internationally are our best allies. While the first two points are what will help us fight diseases already known, research and supra-state capabilities are particularly crucial when we are facing a new disease. Recognizing this, the World Health Organization agreed international regulatory framework of reference in 2005 to ensure commitment to common standards in the region and throughout the world. Every year, the WHO itself measures the degree of implementation of regulations in each country.\nAlthough there are obvious differences in the region it is considerable agreement. There are some worrying points in regard to preparation, and some countries are conspicuously behind the rest. It is also important to note that these WHO figures do not measure the quality or the actual state of health systems in the field. Something that, for example, Venezuela would score well below the rest given the damage to its facilities with the crisis of recent years. All these data indicate that, on paper, the continent has many of the tools of governance needed to face a new epidemic. Now, to know what their exact translation into reality can only hope.'

'888888,0,"From the example of all the containment measures that have been taken, I am convinced that if the outbreak increases much, as Wuhan has closed, the authorities will close China." Who says it to the Express o n the telephone from the city which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus (2019-n-CoV), Wuhan, in Hubei province, is Rui Severino, a citizen of Portuguese and Australian origin who has lived for four years in China.\nSince he returned from Australia to January 15th, after spending Christmas with his children, he says he has made his daily life almost normal.\nBad Severino trains racehorses and the track is characteristic of running the whole country throughout the year. It is based in Wuhan between the months of November and May.\nWhen he returned in January to his home about twenty kilometres away from the centre of Wuhan, a city with 11 million inhabitants, there were already some cases of pneumonia identified, "but not this alarm" from the last few days.\nThis Sunday, when the third case of Coronavirus was confirmed on US territory in Southern California, in a person who travelled from Wuhan to the United States, Rui Severino tells the Express that he decided to stay in China despite the crisis.\nIt is part of an ongoing communication group of 11 Portuguese people living in the city who have been in permanent contact with the Portuguese embassy. They share the anguish and anxieties caused by the situation, but in their opinion, the response of the Chinese authorities and the surveillance of the population assisted at the slightest sign is so "effective" that they have decided not to leave China.\n"We have the horse training center nearby and I come out and go back every day from the condo of six buildings where I live. I feel safe\nYeah. I am controlled twice a day as to the origin and destination of my movements, they measure my temperature on both occasions and ask me if I have gone to the city centre,"it says.\nIt clarifies that these controls are not done by military forces or security forces, "as seen in many images running on social networks," but by "health professionals".\nAs for the images and videos circulating on social networks where people are seen falling to the ground and being picked up on stretchers by the sanitary authorities, Severino clarifies: "The images are true, but the context has to be seen. It is not a disease that brings people down like that all of a sudden."\nIs that strategy? "A person who feels ill and is obliged to wait six hours in the hospital to be attended, if he has the option of letting himself fall to be immediately recalled," he adds.\n"I feel safer here than in Australia, for example, where there are few movement restrictions and they do not properly examine who comes from China," says Rui Severino, adding that in Macao it is neither obligatory to wear street masks despite the information circulating, and in Hong Kong, security measures "are not rigorously enforced".\n"In terms of response I have never seen such a thing," said the Luso-Australian, acknowledging the\'far greater importance of China in the international context\'by comparison to the behaviour of the Chinese authorities during the SARS outbreak, which killed more than 800 people between 2003-4. "At the time, the official figures were lied to, but China has changed a lot and now wants to gain international credibility."\nIt does not know "if official numbers are correct," but sees "here today in the information shared by state television, Chinese social networks and shared information among people" to which it has access, "I am convinced that the numbers are true".\nThe restriction of the citizens\'movement is firm\nYeah. Without public transport, people cannot move within great distances from the large city and the surrounding urban islands.\nFrom the periphery there is no access to the city and food supplies are limited: "There is stress, yes. However, people are still all right, many shops have not yet opened after New Year\'s holidays. The Government said it would provide the region that is closed".\nShortly before speaking on the express, the coach had gone shopping. "There were no fresh ones, but they had frozen in quantity and I bought everything I needed and then went home." We must wait "to see how it will be after the holidays are over", it ends.\n'
'888888,0,Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the Trump administration\'s response to the spreading coronavirus and faced contentious questions from Democrats about an attack that killed Iran\'s most powerful general.\nDemocrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee expressed frustration that the panel was afforded only two hours to question Pompeo, who until Friday had gone months without a public appearance on Capitol Hill.\nDemocratic Representative Gregory Meeks recalled Pompeo\'s "thundering" while in Congress about the need for testimony from one of his Democratic predecessors, Hillary Clinton.\nBut, "for you, sir, we had to move heaven and earth to get you here for just two hours," Meeks said.\nDemocratic Representative Brad Sherman asked sarcastically whether Pompeo would return to Congress next week to detail the steps the administration was taking against the coronavirus or whether he would again wait months for his next public appearance.\nDemocratic committee chairman Representative Eliot Engel called it an "embarrassment" that the panel had been given such a short time to question Pompeo. The secretary said he had briefed Congress more than 70 times on Iran, rejecting allegations that he had not been accessible.\nThe hearing was meant to focus on the Trump administration\'s dealings with Iran and Iraq, but many of the questions centred on the coronavirus. Pompeo said he was confident that the administration had taken action to reduce the threat.\nThe COVID-19 illness caused by a new coronavirus that emerged in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan has stretched well beyond Asia. The global count of those infected as of Friday exceeds 83,000, with China still by far the hardest-hit country. Dozens of cases but no deaths have been confirmed in the United States.\nPompeo\'s testimony comes three weeks after the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, who was accused of abusing his office by withholding aid from Ukraine while he was seeking an investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump, who denied doing anything wrong, was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.\nThe inquiry before House legislators featured the testimony of several foreign service officers, including some who had been enlisted to try to carry out the Republican president\'s wishes and expressed concerns over it.\nThough Pompeo was not a central figure to the impeachment inquiry, he has faced criticism for not doing more to stand up for a workforce that has been attacked by the president - including Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, who was removed last spring after a push by the president\'s allies.\n'
'888888,0,The new Coronavirus from China has now also arrived in Germany. The Bavarian health authorities confirmed the first four cases in the Federal Republic on Tuesday.\nAt first the new lung disease had been detected in a 33-year-old man from Landsberg am Lech district. He was infected in his company in a suburb of Munich with a colleague from China. On Tuesday evening, the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced that three more people were infected with the new Coronavirus. "These patients are also employees of Starnberg County," he continued.\nThe four persons concerned were admitted stationary at the Munich clinic Schwabing, where they were medically monitored and isolated, as the Ministry reported. "Some other contact persons are currently being tested for an infection with the Coronavirus as well." Bayern\'s Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) said, "The company\'s total number of 40 employees who are eligible as close contacts has been identified. The people concerned should be tested on Wednesday as a precautionary measure."Then the Ministry also wants to inform the press about the current situation.\nAccording to information from the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), the 33-year-old had contracted an infection with a colleague from China who had received training last week on the Webasto car supplier in the Gautinger district of Stockdorf in the Upper Bavarian district of Starnberg. The woman didn\'t have her infection until 23rd. January on the return flight to China.\nThe new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV can cause a lung disease in which more than 100 people have already died in the main country of China, most of which were elderly patients with severe pre-existing diseases.\nYeah. The total number of known diseases worldwide has now increased to more than 4500, with at least 106 people dying of lung disease in China.\nThe first Coronavirus patient had tested positive for the virus on Monday and had gone back to work. "He is quite well, he was still working yesterday morning," LGL President Andreas Zapf said. "He is fever-free and has no respiratory symptoms at the moment," added Chief Medical Officer Clemens Wendtner of Schwabing Clinic. The man is in an isolation room, there was no danger to other patients.\nAccording to LGL data, the people who had contact with the Chinese and the first sick German Webasto employee are under observation and are urged not to leave their home. According to the Ministry of Health, his child goes to a crib in Landsberg am Lech district. This too is now under observation, LGL President Zapf said. The family status of the three other patients was not known at first. The head of the Infectiology Task Force, Martin Hoch, stressed: "The number can still rise."\nThe new virus 2019-nCoV was originally believed to originate from a market in the Chinese millionaire city of Wuhan, where wild animals traded there probably jumped to humans. According to current experts, the new type of lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, possibly even without symptoms.\nTransmission before the first symptoms are considered very rare. Thus, the first confirmed case of Coronavirus in Germany may also provide new insights into the pathways of infection of lung disease. Because the man was infected with the Chinese woman after initial knowledge, although at the time she showed no symptoms of the disease.\nThe authorities now want to gradually introduce further measures in Bavaria\nYeah. An official hotline of the Bavarian authorities was established, and some health insurance companies did so. Passengers at Munich Airport are required to see a doctor if they suspect an infection with the new Coronavirus, according to the information provided by the National Office with posters in three languages. Further escalation stages of the alert plan are possible: Currently, together with the federation, it is being discussed "whether it might be useful to measure fever at airports," said Minister Huml. In view of the Coronavirus outbreak this year, the world\'s largest toy fair in Nuremberg is expecting fewer visitors from China.\nThere is no reason to panic, said Huml, as well as her colleague, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). The case shows "that we are well prepared," he said. The risk to human health in Germany remains low, according to the Robert Koch Institute.\nDespite this, respiratory masks were sold out in individual pharmacies in Bavaria. He has heard this from companies in Lower Franconia and Munich, a spokesman for the Bavarian Pharmaceutical Association of the German Press Agency said.\nThe management of Webasto has cleared the staff at Stockdorfer Central for this week whether they want to come to the office or rather work at home. Webasto is a major supplier for the automotive industry with 13,400 employees and a turnover of 3,4 billion euro. The company had previously cancelled all business trips to China for the next two weeks. BMW, Audi and Siemens also stated that only strictly necessary business trips to China will take place.

'888888,0,SEOUL (Reuters) - More than half a million South Koreans have signed a petition calling for a ban on visitors from China as Seoul announced on Tuesday it would evacuate citizens from the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak.\nA petition filed with the presidential Blue House last week had gathered more than 540,000 signatures by Tuesday, highlighting a growing fear in South Korea that the coronavirus could spread.\nSouth Korea has found four cases of the virus.\nThe first was a Chinese national but the other three are South Koreans who traveled from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak started.\nThat has not stopped the calls for Chinese visitors to be banned.\n“Coronavirus is spreading from China. Even North Korea is banning Chinese people from entering,” wrote the anonymous author of the petition, adding that even a temporary ban would help stop the virus from spreading too widely.\nThe Blue House has not directly responded to the petition. When asked about other countries’ bans on Chinese entries, its spokesman said only that the issue should be handled in close consultation with the World Health Organization.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because many of its details are still unknown. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\xa0It is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads.\n“The government must respond to the petition and come up with strong measures such as barring Chinese tourists,” said a passerby in Seoul, a man in his 50s who only gave his surname Chae. He was wearing a surgical mask.\nKim Eun-kyung, 40, a social worker with two children, said she was also concerned about the outbreak but she also worried that a ban on visitors could upset China and bring “political, economic risks”\n.\nThe South Korean government says it is making “all-out efforts” to head off an outbreak and announced it would send at least four flights to Wuhan this week to evacuate nearly 700 South Korean citizens.\n“We’ve come to this decision because our citizens there can’t return on their own due to the lockdown in the region, and they were unable to get proper medical treatment as local clinics are at full capacity,” vice foreign minister Lee Tae-ho told a briefing.\nPeople hoping to leave would be screened before they boarded the flights, he said.\nThe evacuated citizens are expected to be quarantined for about two weeks at two government facilities south of Seoul.\nOn Tuesday, President Moon Jae-in visited a hospital that had been treating one of the four patients, and sent a message to Chinese President Xi Jinping promising to help contain the spread of the virus.\n(The story refiles to correct headline to ‘S.Koreans’)\n'
'888888,0,Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu told off a NCP lawaker today for criticising attempts to push cow urine and dung as treatment options for coronavirus infections, warning her that the House shouldn\'t "create controveries" on a sensitive topic.\nThe exchange took place in the Rajya Sabha when Nationalist Congress Party MP Vandana Chavan was responding to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan\'s statement on India\'s response to the outbreak of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n"There has been talk that using gaumutra and cowdung cakes...is useful [for] mak[ing] this go away," she said. "But scientific research needs to go in."\nAt this point, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu said, "It is up to the people. We are not going to force anything."\nVandana Chavan protested, repeating, "No, sir." But Naidu was already pointing to the next speaker.\n"Let us not make anything light in this House and create controversies on such a sensitive issue. It is your belief," the vice-president told Chavan, before moving on.\nRecently, a BJP MLA from Assam, Suman Haripriya, suggested that cow urine (gaumutra) and cow dung could be used to cure coronavirus infections.\nThis is, of course, bogus. The World Health Organisation states clearly that there are no vaccines or specific medecines yet for Covid-19 -- although some are being looked into -- but only supportive care.\nIndia has reported 29 cases of the novel coronavirus, which was first detected in a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, but has now spread to every continent except Antarctica.\n'
'888888,0,Coronavirus outbreak has been reported from 75 countries after originating in Wuhan in China in mid-December, and first reporting in mid-January. Sitting next to epicentre of coronavirus outbreak, India managed to keep Covid-19 or Coronavirus Disease 2019 largely at bay for more than two months.\nNow, at least 28 people have tested positive for Covid-19, the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said. First three cases were reported from Kerala in February. There were isolated and discharged after a successful treatment.\nIndia evacuated around 200 people from Wuhan and kept them in quarantine at a camp in the outskirts of Delhi. They too were released after 14 days of quarantine.\nWhen it seemed that India might have pulled out a miracle of sort in insulating itself from an international contagion, two fresh cases over the weekends shook up the nation. Rush to medical stores became frantic in every major city and, hand sanitisers and face masks of all kinds became scarce once again.\nOf the two cases, one was reported from Delhi sending the media in alarm mode with government agencies asking people not to panic and follow advisory, most important of which requires keeping hands clean either with soap or alcohol-based sanitisers, minimise hand-face contact, staying away from infected persons and report to a hospital if there are symptoms such as sore throat, breathlessness combined with other indicators of flu.\nReporting to hospitals in case of symptoms is key to preventing further spread of coronavirus infection. Scientists are yet to conclusively ascertain that how many healthy persons may be infected by one Covid-19 patient. Some Covid-19 patients may infect more persons than other carriers. Quarantine and isolation - depending on when the carrier reports contact with infected person or infection - is a must for such persons.\nCOVID-19 SUPER SPREADER\nDiscovery of one such patient during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS outbreak in 2003 had led to use of the term, "super spreader", which is not officially recognised by government agencies or the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn the case of coronavirus outbreak the first super spreader was identified in South Korea. Now, she is known as "Patient 31" and is held responsible for spreading corornavirus to "countless" people.\nShe is a member of a little known religious sect, Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has filed a formal complaint against the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, accusing it of murder.\nThe reason is that the Patient 31 continued to attend public gatherings including at restaurants, markets and church apparently ignoring the advice of doctors. The sentiment in South Korea is that she should have taken her case seriously and presented herself to health authorities.\nTHE INDIAN CASE\nIn India, the prompt action in the initial stage by the Kerala health authorities in shifting the first Covid-19 patients to isolation and the Indian government in keeping the Wuhan evacuees in quarantine killed the chances of anyone turning into a super spreader.\nBut with the reporting of fresh cases has revived the fear. The Delhi coronavirus patient, a 45-year-old man, returned from a Europe tour on February 25. He had been to Italy on a road trip.\nItaly is one of the worst-affected countries in the grip of coronavirus outbreak. But his screening could not be done at the airport as the government put Italy on the watch-list only on February 26 when reports of coronavirus infection from the country became too frequent.\nOn his return, he went about his daily routine as usual. He threw birthday party for his son, where students of two prominent schools in Noida were also present. The two schools had now been shut.\nAfter a few days, when the man showed symptoms of Covid-19, he reported to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. The government authorities are still in the process of contact-tracing all those, this patient came in contact.\nSix of his relatives from Agra in Uttar Pradesh became coronavirus patients after he visited them upon his return from Europe tour.\nIGNORANCE IS LOSS, NOT BLISS\nThe other patient is a software engineer, who works in Bengaluru but belongs to Hyderabad. He had been to Dubai, where his coworkers were from Hong Kong, a country severely affected by coronavirus outbreak.\nHe returned from Dubai on February 19/20 and reported to his office. Few days later, he took a bus to Hyderabad, where he showed symptoms of Covid-19 and approached a private hospital first. He was referred to a government hospital, where his coronavirus infection was confirmed.\nThe government authorities are in the process of contact-tracing of all the people the infected techie might have come in contact with including the passengers of the bus. More than 100 people are being monitored for suspected coronavirus infection.\nCOVID-19 FROM ITALY GUESTS\nThe biggest case of coronavirus infection reported in India is of a group of Italian tourists who arrived in Rajasthan in the last week of February. The group had been travelling till a 69-year-man of the troupe was confirmed as a Covid-19 patient. They went to places including Agra. They were assisted by Indian tour operators and guides.\nNow, 15 of the Italian group have tested positive and shifted to specialised camp in the outskirts of Delhi. The authorities are on contact-tracing hunt to screen all those people who came in contact with this group and advise quarantine measures to all the suspects.\nA driver who was ferried the Italian group has also tested positive for coronavirus.\nHOW NOT TO BE SUPER SPREADER\nIt is important to understand who can be a coronavirus carrier. Practically, anyone who has come in direct or indirect contact with a Covid-19 patient or carrier. Normally, an infected person would show symptoms and once reported, the doctors would keep the patient in isolation.\nBut some other persons, with robust immune system, may be able to suppress the symptoms and yet pass on the virus to people with vulnerable immunity. Since the coronavirus spreader may not show symptoms due to strong immunity, he or she might continue to infect others, and become a super spreader.\nSecondly, not every coronavirus carrier or patient houses same load of virus. Those with greater load are capable of infecting greater number of people.\nEach one of the Covid-19 patients diagnosed in India was a potential super spreader. Italian group remained unscreened and non-quarantined for far too long. The Delhi man reported days after his visit to Italy, and the country having been placed on the watchlist. Reporting of his travel to Italy on February 26 would have containing the spread of coronavirus, and saved even his own relatives.\nBengaluru techie too did not report to health authorities despite having come in contact with professionals from Hong Kong, which was already infested by Covid-19. He was not screened, quarantined or isolated for days after he is suspected to have contracted coronavirus infection.\nReporting his contact with Hong Kong nationals would have saved several people in at least two cities - Bengaluru and Hyderabad - from the scare of possible coronavirus infection.\nAll these Covid-19 patients went ahead with their usual routine not realising that they could be coronavirus carriers, and potential super spreaders. It is time to report. Remember the old saying, prevention is better than cure.\n'
'888888,0,The World Health Organization has warned of the risk that COVID-19 could overwhelm strained public health systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Here is a selection of measures countries are taking to prepare for the virus and limit its spread.  \n  \n SOUTH AFRICA  \n With more cases than any other country in sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa is barring entry to foreign travellers\xa0coming from or transiting through\xa0high-risk countries including Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and China, according to an advisory issue by the foreign ministry on Tuesday.  \n Travellers who arrived from these countries since mid-February must report for testing. Those arriving from medium-risk countries – Portugal, Hong Kong and Singapore – will undergo high intensity screening.  \n South Africans are advised to cancel or postpone all non-essential foreign travel.\xa0The government has also ordered schools to close early for the Easter break and will prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people.  \n  \n NIGERIA  \n Africa\'s most populous nation is from Friday banning entry to arrivals from 13 of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus, including the United States, Britain, Germany and China.  \n It has also stepped up surveillance and is preparing for the possibility of an influx of patients.  \n Lagos, the biggest city with some 20 million people, could handle 2,000 cases, said Bamidele Mutiu, who heads a regional biosafety team. To do this, they would need to use two camps previously housing people displaced by violence, he said.  \n Authorities are checking the temperature of anyone who arrives at Nigeria\'s airports, ports and land borders.  \n Those coming from high-risk countries such as China, Iran, Italy and Spain are asked to self-isolate for 14 days, said Tarik Mohammed, a technical advisor at the Niger Centre for Disease Control. If they develop symptoms, a laboratory team will visit them and collect a sample for testing.  \n  \n KENYA  \n The East African country is suspending travel from any nation with reported COVID-19 cases.  \n Only Kenyan citizens, foreigners with residence permits and United Nations workers will be allowed to come in, provided they proceed on self-quarantine, the government said this week.  \n Schools and universities are closing, and public minibuses are providing hand sanitizer.  \n  \n ETHIOPIA  \n Ethiopian Airlines said on its website that medics stationed at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, a key regional transit hub, carry out continuous health screenings 24/7.  \n The government in the Horn of Africa country has closed schools nationwide and offered to transport people on government buses to ease congestion on public transport.  \n  \n RWANDA  \n The East African country is flooding its capital, Kigali, with portable sinks for hand-washing at bus stops, restaurants, banks and shops. Schools, universities, churches and courts are closed nationwide. Some flights are suspended.  \n  \n CAMEROON  \n From Wednesday, Cameroon, in central Africa, will close land, air and sea borders indefinitely, the government said in statement on Tuesday. International flights will be grounded, with the exception of cargo planes. Schools and restaurants will shut, and gatherings of more than 50 people are banned.  \n  \n LIBERIA  \n The West African country is applying lessons learned fighting a devastating Ebola outbreak in 2014-15.  \n "We were one of the first countries to start enhanced screening at the airport on Jan. 25," said\xa0Mosoka P. Fallah, acting director general of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia.  \n More than 200 people have been trained as field epidemiologists and check for diseases in all 90 districts, said Tolbert Nyenswah, senior research associate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the United States and former incident manager for Liberia’s Ebola response.  \n "If there is a case of a suspected disease, a sample is sent to a lab and tested."  \n There are hand-washing stations at public places including stores, shops, schools, hospitals, restaurant and government offices.  \n  \n SENEGAL  \n Has been taking all passengers\' temperatures since Jan. 28 and asks for contact details, so officials can reach them if someone else on the plane tests positive, a spokesman for Dakar airport said.  \n  \n GHANA  \n Has implemented some of the most stringent measures in West Africa with a mandatory 14 days of quarantine for all people arriving from abroad. Travelers from countries with over 200 cases of coronavirus are barred from entering the country unless they are Ghanaian citizens or residents.  \n  \n MAURITANIA  \n After confirming its first case on March 13, the West African country closed the international airport, suspended teaching in schools and universities, and banned weekly markets.  \n  \n MADAGASCAR  \n One of the world’s poorest countries, the island nation has suspended all flights for 30 days, a blow to its tourism industry.

'888888,0,Wuhan new virus, which has already left six dead in China and hundreds of people affected, has crossed the Pacific. A man in his 30s who traveled to the Chinese region was diagnosed with the virus last week in Seattle, in the State of Washington, confirmed Tuesday the Center for Disease Control (CDC), while nationwide I was glued to the television to follow the impeachment against Donald Trump in the Senate.\nWuhan virus is a new coronavirus called 2019-nCov transmitted between humans and causes respiratory diseases. It was first detected less than a month. From this city, located in the central part of the Chinese territory and where 11 million people live -more than London or New York, the disease began to spread to neighboring provinces. Last Friday, for example, there was no positive out there, but now there are 38 cases spread across 15 other major cities Chinese and jumped to four countries in Southeast Asia.\nPatient Seattle, which is currently unknown identity, is admitted to the Regional Medical Center Everett, the capital of Snohomish County (Washington). It is stable, responding to treatment and is not considered a risk. The CDC has also explained that the patient had no symptoms when he landed on January 15 in the US. He went to the doctor last Sunday and was hospitalized for pneumonia.\nThe patient did not visit any of the markets of Wuhan, where numerous cases of people affected by the virus were confirmed, but it was in the region, as explained to the press Nancy Messonnier, director of the department of respiratory diseases the CDC. Authorities are looking for all the people who have been in contact with the patient these days, Messonnier said. They do not expect more cases.\nSince last Friday 17, the CDC had imposed special controls to monitor the possible entry of the virus to the country\'s busiest airports on the West Coast, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and New York. They are the three airports with more passengers from the region of Wuhan. The CDC has allocated about 100 workers at these airports and quarantine rooms installed. Health authorities were alert for two weeks. On January 11 they had issued a health warning Level 1 passenger who had been in Wuhan.\nA group of experts from the Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong suggests that reality is even more worrying that the data offered by China. According to his report prepared in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and presented Tuesday, the total number of infected may already touching 1,500: 1,343 in Wuhan and 115 in the rest of the country.\nIn addition to China and the US, there have been cases of people with the virus detected in South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Taiwan, where a 55 year old woman has also been recognized Tuesday with the disease. As in previous cases, he traveled to Wuhan in recent weeks. Minister of Health of the island, Chen Shih-chung, insured has none of the relatives of the patient presents symptoms any, similar to those of an ordinary pneumonia, and 46 others who were in contact with her during the journey aircraft have been placed under observation. In addition, the Philippines and Australia have also announced to have taken action at the first suspected cases in its territory.\nWHO he conducted Monday a visit to Wuhan with a group of Chinese health experts, led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, director of the State Laboratory of Infectious Diseases in Canton and national eminence in the field. According to experts conglomerate, 15 medical workers in the city have contracted the virus, confirming the spread between humans end -a ruled until the end of past- week.\nThe escalation of this new coronavirus, discovered two weeks ago, reminiscent of the SARS epidemic, which has similarities with genetic. The epidemic of 2002, also originated in China, it has killed 700 people worldwide. WHO held tomorrow Wednesday an emergency meeting to decide whether to declare a "public health emergency of international" because of the outbreak. The Chinese State Council, meanwhile, has also scheduled a press conference in which he detailed the evolution of the virus in the last hours.'
'888888,0,According to the opinion of the world\'s largest chemical company BASF, the new Coronavirus will place a significant burden on the world economy. "This year we are already experiencing a high level of uncertainty in the world economy in the first two months," said BASF chief Martin Brudermuller on Friday.\nThe virus added a new factor which significantly affected growth at the beginning of the year, especially in China. The consequences of the measures against the spread of the virus would be a reduction in demand and production losses in many industries, he said, when presenting the annual figures.\nBASF expects negative effects especially in the first and second quarters. "I warn against giving premature revelation just because the numbers of patients in China are falling," said Brudermuller. It does not expect the Coronavirus effects to be fully offset over the year.\nFor the entire 2020-year, the head of the company expects the world economy to grow at two percent slower than 2019. It also expects significantly lower growth rates for global chemistry. "This would be by far the lowest growth since the financial crisis 2008/2009," Brudermuller added.\n"If I had to overwrite this, I would throw our team: Kneel! "said the head of BASF. "We are now simply making our strategy, which is the right one. We can\'t change the environment. But we can make the best of it."\nDue to the uncertain consequences of the Coronavirus, BASF has indicated a large range for the annual targets, "This shows the uncertainty". Revenue is expected to rise 2020 to 60 billion euro to 63 billion euro, after 59,3 billion euro last year. For the adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit), the company measures 4,2 billion euro to 4,8 billion euro after a decrease of 28 percent to 4,5 billion euro 201Yeah.\nFor 2019, BASF wants to spend a little more money on the shareholders than expected. The dividend is to be increased by ten cents to 3.30 euros per share. The profit after taxes and minorities increased 2019 by nearly 80 percent to eight,4 billion euros in the annual comparison. Here, however, was a book profit from the decolonization of the oil and guest daughter Wintershall, up to around 5.7 billion euros.\n"2019 was a challenging year with a strong global wind," said Brudermuller. The trade disputes between the USA and China had a negative effect and important markets developed more slowly. In addition, there are uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Demand from many important customer industries had fallen significantly, mainly from the automotive industry.\nIn order to make the group more profitable, the brother-miller, who has been in office for almost two years, set up a savings program at the end of 2018. This includes job deletions. BASF accelerated the savings rate, said Brudermuller. Now the dismantling of 6000-digit sites is to be achieved at the end of 2020, one year earlier than planned. In return, BASF plans to invest 23,6 billion euros in the next five years.\nLast year, BASF merged its oil and gas daughter Wintershall with its rival Dea. The company is expected to go public in Frankfurt in the second half of the year. "We are preparing an IPO," said BASF Finance Director Hans-Ulrich Engel. Whether it comes as planned, however, depends on the market conditions.\nThe BASF majority participation of Wintershall Dea is the focus for the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Wintershall Dea is financially involved in the pipeline to transport gas directly from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. The project is a thorn in the United States\'side. That is why the companies involved in the pipeline are threatened with sanctions. Construction is currently on icYeah.\n"Alternatives for completing Nord Stream 2 are being considered," said Engel. After the construction stopped, Russia had set in motion a special ship for the laying of gas pipelines. At the moment the stop has no concrete disadvantages for Wintershall Dea, Engel said. The pipeline should be completed by the end of 2020. (dpa'

On Saturday, the director general of the World Health Organization (who), tederos Adana gebreysu, pointed out this in a statement at the Munich Security Conference.\nHe said it was impossible to predict where the epidemic would go The head of who expressed particular concern about the impact of the epidemic on countries with weak health systems.\nIn this regard, he called on the international community to unite in the fight against the Colorado virus. " "We must be guided by solidarity," he added, adding that the main threat now is not the virus itself, but stigmatization, and hatred must stop. " Gebreyesus also warned against politicizing the coronavirus issue. " It\'s easy to blame and politicize, but it\'s more difficult to solve problems together.

'888888,0,The global economy is already in a recession as the hit to economic activity from the coronavirus pandemic has become more widespread, according to economists polled by Reuters amid a raft of central bank stimulus actions this week.\nThe spread of the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19, has sent financial markets into a tailspin despite some of the biggest emergency stimulus measures since the global financial crisis announced by dozens of central banks across Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia.\nThe panic was clear in stocks, bonds, gold and commodity prices, underlining expectations of severe economic damage from the outbreak.\nMore than three-quarters of economists based in the Americas and Europe polled this week, 31 of 41, said the current global economic expansion had already ended, in response to a question about whether the global economy was already in recession.\n"Last week we concluded that the COVID-19 shock would produce a global recession as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April," noted Bruce Kasman, head of global economic research at JP Morgan.\n"There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. The key outlook issue now is gauging the depth and the duration of the 2020 recession."\nEconomists have repeatedly cut their growth outlook over the past month and have increased their forecast probabilities for recession in most major economies.\nThe worst-case views on growth taken just weeks ago in some cases have already into the central scenario for private sector economists in Reuters polls.\n"The evolving news on COVID-19 has triggered forecast leap frogging,’ with economists and strategists repeatedly lowering their forecasts. Among the big three economies, the US and the euro area will see negative growth, while Chinese growth is expected to come in at a paltry 1.5 per cent," said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at BofA.\n"Our first piece on the virus shock was titled bad or worse’; now we amend that to \'really bad or much worse.\' We now expect COVID-19 to cause a global recession in 2020, of similar magnitude to the recessions of 1982 and 2009."\nThe global economy was forecast to expand 1.6 per cent this year, about half the 3.1per cent predicted in the January poll, and the weakest since the global financial crisis of 2007-09.\nForecasts for 2020 global GDP ranged from -2.0% to +2.7 per cent.\n"As cases of coronavirus spiral upward, disruptions to the global economy are increasing. We have cut our global GDP growth forecast to 1.25 per cent for the year - less severe than the deep recessions of 1981-82 and 2008-09, but worse than the mild recessions of 1991 and 2001," noted Goldman Sachs’ economics research team.\n"Consistent with this, our economists now expect recessions in Europe, Japan, Canada and possibly the United States."\nThe US economy was almost certain to enter a recession this year, if it is not in one already, according to a poll published on Thursday and taken after the Federal Reserve’s emergency move on Sunday.\n"The US economy is going to have a shock from this coronavirus and I think that there’s still a lot of uncertainty around the size and the depth and the prolonged period of the shock," said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO).\n"We’re still getting our heads wrapped around that. We think it’s quite likely that the US has a small technical recession this year."\nAs for the world’s second largest economy, China, where the virus outbreak originated, a Reuters poll published on March 6 showed the outlook was once again cut significantly for this quarter, next quarter, and for 2020.\nSince then, economists have been slashing their forecasts even more.\nThe economic damage from the outbreak was predicted to reverberate through other major economies in Asia too, with most forecast to slow significantly, halt or shrink outright in the current quarter according to a February 26 Reuters poll.\nJapan’s economy, which already contracted sharply toward the end of 2019, was expected to grow only 0.1 per cent in the new fiscal year that begins in April, a March 6 Reuters survey found, revised down from 0.5 per cent projected in February.\nFollowing the rapid spread of virus infections from China to other countries, including Europe, the risk of a euro zone recession doubled in a poll taken earlier this month.\nIt was not very different for the UK, where the Bank of England cut rates to near-zero on Thursday and re-started its asset purchases.\nThe British economy was expected to expand 0.1 per cent this quarter and then contract 0.3% next quarter, a sharp revision from the 0.3 per cent expansion they had expected before for both the quarters in the previous poll.\nIn a worst case scenario, the economy was forecast to contract 1.0 per cent next quarter and by 0.7% in 2020. Forecasts were as low as -5.0 per cent and -3.0 per cent, respectively, with no economist expecting growth in either period in the worst case.\n'

'888888,0,LONDON (Reuters) - Here are some key features of coronaviruses and what we know about the new virus that was identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\n** Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n** Coronavirus infections can lead to respiratory illnesses - some of which can be severe and deadly, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and some of which can be much milder, such as the common cold.\n** Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.\n** Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people and can evolve into strains not previously identified in humans.\n** Preliminary research has suggested that the Wuhan coronavirus may have made the jump into humans from snakes. But Chinese government medical experts have also suggested badgers and rats as possible sources.\n** Like other coronaviruses, the new China virus is being transmitted from person-to-person via droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n** Like the viruses that cause MERS and SARS, the new China virus is an RNA virus, which means it has RNA rather than DNA as its genetic material. This means the virus blends with its host’s DNA, and also means it can mutate rapidly.\n** Testing for the new China virus involves using a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which identifies the viral RNA in a sample. These could be from a throat swab, a cough sample, or a blood sample if the patient is very ill\n.\n(This story refiles to correct wording in first paragraph to say virus was identified in Wuhan)\n'

'888888,0,The spread of the new Coronavirus hits the German economy in the middle of the flare.\nAs economic growth stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the previous quarter, Europe\'s largest economy is entering the current year without a significant backlash. The hope of a rapid recovery in the economy is fading, since the Coronavirus epidemic has now arrived in Europe and is now spreading mainly in Italy. The German economy is concerned about developments in Italy, the third largest euro economy.\n"Germany\'s strongest trump card has developed into a weak point: the openness and dependence on exports and global trade," explained Carsten Brzeski, Chief Popular Value of ING Germany. Economists, however, do not currently expect a downturn.\nLast year, international trade conflicts and the cooling of the world economy have already slowed down economic development. At the end of the year 2019, the German economy ran out of steam. In the fourth quarter, gross domestic product stagnated compared to the previous quarter. The Federal Statistical Office confirmed provisional data on Tuesday.\nThe boom in construction investments supported the economy between October and December. On the other hand, consumption, most recently the engine of the economy, lost significantly after a very strong third quarter. Private consumption expenditure stagnated at the end of the year, and the State only slightly increased its consumption expenditure by 0.3 percent. Declining exports dampened development.\nIn the total year the German economy grew by 0.6 percent. This was significantly less than in the previous two years. Growth was as weak as 2019 last 2013.\nThe spread of the Coronavirus could, according to economists, delay the expected recovery this yeaYeah. Some expect a decrease in economic performance in the first quarter, others expect a further stagnation compared to the previous quarter.\nThe main concern is the development in China, where the Sars-CoV-2 virus first broke out. The second largest economy in the world is an important market for "Made in Germany" products. At the same time parts are produced in Germany for production.\nAccording to the Bundesverband der Deutsche Industrie (BDI), several industries are expecting bottlenecks in the coming weeks in supplies from the Far East, including electricity, automobile, pharmaceuticals and paper. "Due to major uncertainties on the world markets, the German economy has already started in a weak new year," said BDI chief manager Joachim Lang recently. "The effects of the epidemic further increase the pressure on our companies."\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already lowered its economic forecasts for China and the world economy. The global economy is expected to grow by 0.1 percent less than previously assumed. IMF chief Kristalina Georgiewa admitted that there are still major uncertainties. "Many scenarios can take place depending on how quickly the virus is contained and how quickly the Chinese and other affected economies are returning to normal."\nAccording to Commerzbank chief economist Jorg Kramer, the virus is expected to prolong the industrial recession in Germany by a few months. The first quarter will be bad in China. "It is quite possible that this will reduce the GDP in the first quarter due to declining exports and lack of supplies."\nKfW-Chefswirtin Fritzi Kohler-Geib expects the economic stagnation in Germany to continue at firsYeah. However, if the Corona epidemic persists and also affects other regions of the world more, serious effects on external trade, among other things, would be more likely. "The situation in Italy therefore concerns me."\nThe German economy warned of the consequences of the Coronavirus crisis in Italy. "The rapid spread of the virus, especially in the north, is hitting the economic centre of Italy and is currently creating additional insecurity for the German export industry," said Volker Treier, head of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK).\nPublic coffers are well-stocked despite the economic weakness. Thanks to the continuing good situation on the labour market, social security contributions and taxes have been pouring heavily into public coffers over the past year. At the same time, the ultra-loose monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB), which was particularly controversial in Germany, provided relief. Because of the low interest rates, the State can borrow more cheaply.\nIn total 49,8 billion euros (previous year: 62,4 billion) the Federal Statistical Office recorded the surplus of the federal government, countries, municipalities and social funds last year. All levels of government contributed to this. The highest surplus was reported to have been 20,1 billion euros.\nThe surplus was a total of 1,4 per cent of gross domestic product, by 1,9 per cent in the previous year. Europe\'s largest economy last recorded a deficit in 2011. Germany, with the surplus, is far from the deficit limit of the Maastricht Treaty, in which Europeans allow themselves a budget deficit of three,0 percent of economic performance. (dpa'

"888888,0,SINGAPORE — All new visitors who have travelled to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from 11.59pm on Wednesday (March 4), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday. This comes at a time when the number of Covid-19 cases has been spreading further and increasing globally. \n Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders\xa0with a travel history to these places within the last 14 days will be issued with a stay-home notice. Long-term pass holders include\xa0those holding work passes, student’s passes, dependant’s and long-term visit passes. \n The stay-home notice compels them to not\xa0leave home\xa0for a 14-day\xa0period after their return to Singapore.\xa0 \n Correspondingly, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Tuesday it will require all work pass holders — regardless of their nationality and including dependants — with travel history to these places within the last 14 days and planning to enter or return to Singapore, to obtain the ministry’s approval before they commence their journey.\xa0 \n The requirement applies to existing work pass holders currently out of Singapore, and in-principle approval holders who have yet to enter Singapore.\xa0 \n In addition, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will not issue all forms of new visas to those with Iranian passports with immediate effect, MOH said. \n Those holding Iranian passports who were also issued short-term and multiple-visit visas will have these visas suspended and will not be allowed to enter Singapore. \n Singaporeans are\xa0advised to defer non-essential travel to Japan, Iran, northern Italy and South Korea. \n The expanded travel restrictions add to the restrictions already imposed on travellers from mainland China, and come as Iran, Italy and South Korea face mounting Covid-19 crises. \n As of noon on March 3, there were 90,689 confirmed cases of Covid-19 globally, including 10,538 cases outside of China. South Korea has reported 4,812 confirmed cases so far. Italy has 1,835 cases, while Iran has 1,501. \n Japan, which is not affected by the enhanced travel measures, has confirmed 268 cases so far, MOH said. \n National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who chairs the multi-ministry taskforce for Covid-19, said that Japan is not included in the incoming restrictions because\xa0its number of confirmed cases is lower than the\xa0other countries at this stage. \n “For Japan, we are managing the risk by having an advisory on outgoing trips at this juncture,” Mr Wong told reporters on Tuesday. \n MOH said that\xa0the extra precautions will help reduce the risk of imported cases, but the coronavirus is still spreading quickly around the world. \n “In the days ahead, it is likely that we will see a surge of infected cases in countries around the world, including in America, Europe, the Middle East and the rest of Asia. Singapore is a small, globally connected city-state and we are faced with a higher risk of imported cases,” it said in its statement. \n “There are likely to be many undetected cases in countries that are not undertaking proactive testing,” it added,\xa0without naming any countries. \n “Increasingly, it will not be possible to stop the virus at our borders. We also cannot isolate Singapore and shut ourselves from the world. Despite our best efforts, we have to be prepared for new spikes in Covid-19 cases in Singapore, as has happened elsewhere.”\xa0 \n Mr Wong explained that border control measures are still useful at this stage\xa0“because we can still identify where the sources of risks are and then we can take appropriate measures to reduce the risk” of imported cases of\xa0Covid-19. \n “By doing so, we (can) flatten the epidemic curve in Singapore. We buy ourselves time and we avoid a situation where our hospitals get overwhelmed by a sudden surge of cases,” he said. \n However, Singapore may come to a point where travel restrictions and border controls alone will no longer be enough\xa0once the coronavirus spreads to nearby countries, he added. \n “It will depend on how widely the virus spreads in other countries. It's our assessment of how endemic it becomes around the world. And at that juncture, I think some of these restrictions may become less relevant,” Mr Wong said. \n Urging Singaporeans to continue practising good personal hygiene, MOH said that it will redouble its efforts and continue put resources into detecting and isolating Covid-19 cases as well as close contacts to “break the chain of infection”. \n MOH said that Singaporeans should adopt the following practices: \n Stay\xa0home when unwell, including during the period covered by medical certificates \n Wash\xa0hands regularly with soap and water, and not touching the face unnecessarily \n Clean\xa0up after themselves at hawker centres and not sharing utensils. \n “These need to be a part of our daily life permanently. Such habits will enable us to resist infections like Covid-19, while going about our daily lives normally as much as possible,” the ministry said. \n "
'888888,0,LONDON (Reuters) - The European, Americas and final world qualifying boxing tournaments for the Tokyo Olympic Games were suspended on Monday after falling victim to the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the globe.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC), whose Boxing Task Force (BTF) is organising the events after the suspension last year of world body AIBA, acted as countries went into lockdown and sport ground to a halt.\nThe Americas and final world tournaments have yet to happen but the 10-day European event at London’s Copper Box, on the site of the 2012 Olympics, was already into its third day of competition.\nSixteen male boxers, flyweights and featherweights, still managed to secure their tickets to Tokyo before the shutdown came into force at the end of Monday’s evening session.\nBritish flyweight Galal Yafai was the first to qualify, even if the Games’ July 24 starting date is looking increasingly uncertain.\nYafai beat Russia’s Rasul Saliev to reach the quarter-finals, with a guaranteed Tokyo slot for the last eight in the division, and was followed by top-seeded Frenchman Billal Bennama.\n“With everything that’s gone on this week outside of boxing, it’s great to just get it done,” Yafai, who fought at the 2016 Rio Games, told the BBC.\n“I put it to the back of my mind this week, but just before the fight I was told that the competition would end after today, so I was thinking ‘oh gosh, I need to make sure I win’.”\nThe BTF had already closed the doors to spectators after Sunday’s sessions.\nAfrica, Asia and Oceania have held their qualifying tournaments while the Americas one scheduled for Buenos Aires on March 26-April 3 was postponed last week. The final worlds were due in Paris on May 13-20.\nThe Asia and Oceania event was held in Amman, Jordan, this month after being moved from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic.\nThe task force said it would provide details on the qualification process for the other regions at a later date.\n“The BTF...took the decision to suspend the event today, amid increasing global travel restrictions and quarantine measures, in order to allow the participants from over 60 countries to adjust their travel plans and return home,” the IOC said in a statement.\n“The BTF will continue to evaluate the situation daily, aiming to complete the distribution of the remaining Tokyo 2020 boxing quota places in May and June.”\n“The BTF’s priority remains the qualification of athletes on the field of play, and it will inform all stakeholders as soon as more information is available,” it said.\nThe IOC will hold talks with heads of international sports organisations on Tuesday in response to the coronavirus outbreak and will also hold an unscheduled Executive Board teleconference to discuss the latest developments.\n'
'888888,0,Laughter they say is the best medicine. At least to beat the blues resulting from the coronavirus lockdown.\nSubtle and sharp, sarcastic and self-deprecating. And sometimes just downright rude. There are wife jokes, husband jokes, boss barbs, Modi jibes, weight gain worries and the inevitable China insults. Humour in all forms is the panacea it seems for people around the world who are united in their need to laugh or at least crack a smile in these troubled times.\nAs three billion people across the world stay indoors in a lockdown never before seen on this planet, some are sharpening their creativity and the rest are having fun with the jokes flooding in through memes, cartoons, videos, one-liners and others.And they are all going around the world in minutes, thanks to the ubiquitous social media, particularly WhatsApp.\nNo subject is out of bounds as people all over use wordplay, clever drawings and other witticisms to mirror a society, warts and all, going through its worst crisis in a century.\nOne pocket cartoon shows a bride flinging a garland at the groom on the other side of the fire. Given the threat of coronavirus, both are in masks and the priest is seated a distance away.\nAnother perhaps reflecting matrimony many years down the line has a woman, her brows knitted together as she wields a spoon over a wok, and her smiling husband slouched on the sofa watching \'Lock-down special\' on TV. "No, he is not helping at all. He just claps for me for a full 5 minutes a day," she complains.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had urged people to stand on the balconies of their houses for five minutes on Sunday, March 22, at 5 pm and clap as a sign of thanks for emergency and healthcare workers.\nFrom memes featuring prominent politicians to hilarious work-from-home jokes, from bad puns to good cartoons, Indians and others have taken to Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook in a bid to tackle the stress from the spread of the virus, which has affected more than 530,000 people and claimed over 24,000 lives.\nIn India, the disease has hit more than 720 people and killed 17.\n"Ghar se taali bajane ko bola tha, dhol manjira leke raste pe kirtan karne ko kisne bola (I had asked you to clap in your homes, who asked you to go out and celebrate while playing musical instruments)," reads one meme.\nAnd there is this cartoon that makes fun of the new \'work-from-home\' trend with panic-stricken passengers on a plane. "This is your pilot speaking. I\'m working from home today", reads the text.\nThe work/stay at home dogma takes a swipe at the couch potato too -- a split frame of a man fast asleep on the couch with a remote in his hand and the words \'2019 Lazy Bast***\', and the same pic below but this time with the label \'2019 Responsible Adult\'.\nMany posts are quirky and slightly snide wordplays -- "Villagers in Punjab are still wondering who the hell is Soshail Distan Singh?", for instance, or "Xi Jinping\'s message to the world: No Ming Ling".\n"Finally got the Hindi name of social distancing \'TAN DOORI"\', reads a WhatsApp forward breaking up word for food cooked in a tandoor to \'tan\' (body) and \'doori\' (distance).\nWith India under an unprecedented 21-day lockdown to curtail the spread of the disease, a meme makes a reference to India\'s richest man, Reliance Industries\' Mukesh Ambani, and his palatial 27-storey residence Antilla in south Mumbai.\n"Lockdown ki wajah se aaj maine pehli baar apna pur ghar dekh liya (It is because of the lockdown that I got to see my whole house for the first time)".\nA widely-shared meme on the lockdown features former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, released from detention in Srinagar earlier this week. It shows him with his hand on his forehead and a text saying, "When you spend 236 days in lockdown, and on the day you get out, the govt imposes 21-day national lockdown."\nThe meme later got approval by the National Conference leader himself, who re-tweeted it and wrote: "These are serious & scary times so a little humour doesn\'t hurt".\nAnd then there is this one that says, "My body has absorbed so much soap and disinfectant lately that when I pee it cleans the toilet."\nThere are also several posts trolling China either for allegedly spreading the virus to other countries or its peculiar eating habits.\n"Ek toh pehle China ko Jain banao (Firstly, make Chinese residents follow Jainism)," tweeted one Karan Sitlani, referring to the vegetarianism of the Jain community.\nAnother Whatsapp forward takes a jibe at the Chinese products, "Coronavirus won\'t last long because it was made in China".\nThe novel coronavirus, which originated in the central Hubei province of China in December, according to two recent studies published in the journal Nature, may have originated from bats.\nVideos are making their point too.\nOne doing the rounds has a wife telling her husband to call the house help because she hasn\'t come for three days. The man calls her only to be told that she is working from home and will tell him what needs to be cleaned in his home -- overturning the class dynamic while stressing that coronavirus affects everyone.\nAnother has a father trying to put his crying child to sleep. All it takes is his sternly calling out to \'corona\' and the child is quickly silenced.\nSometimes it is just savage and dark. Like this one-liner, doing the social media rounds, which says, "We can meet in May if all stay put at home or shall meet in heaven".\nOr this one, "Dear God, please reboot 2020. It has a virus".\nAnd, of course, as in all kinds of humour, some jokes are sexist and racist too, using tired tropes. Humour, sometimes good and sometimes tired, can be infectious too. And as the world waits for this crisis to end, people all over can say -- just bring the smiles on.\n'
'888888,0,(Adds Pentagon statement detailing flight destinations)\nBy Eric Beech and Steve Gorman\nWASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Two planes with about 300 passengers, mostly U.S. citizens, took off from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday bound for the United States — the third group of evacuees from the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. State Department said.\nOne of the flights had room to accommodate more than 60 Canadians, who will disembark on a stopover in Vancouver, British Columbia, before the remaining passengers continue on to the United States, a State Department spokeswoman told Reuters.\nThe plane stopping in Vancouver will fly on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in Southern California, the Pentagon said in a separate statement.\nThe second aircraft is headed for Omaha, Nebraska, by way of Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, following a refueling stop in California, the Defense Department said. Both planes are due to arrive on Friday.\nThe Defense Department has set aside surplus housing at each of those and a handful of other U.S. bases as quarantine sites for American evacuees arriving from Wuhan or the surrounding province of Hubei, where the coronavirus originated.\nThe first evacuation flight from Wuhan, carrying 195 State Department employees, their family members and other Americans, arrived Jan. 29 at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles.\nAnother group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from Wuhan arrived on Wednesday aboard two cargo jets - 178 of them taken to Travis Air Force Base in northern California and 167 others to Miramar near San Diego.\nFollowing the same procedures of previous flights, the latest wave of evacuees will be met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening and will be placed under quarantine for 14 days, the extent of the incubation period for the coronavirus, the Pentagon said\n.\nAny who show signs of illness will likely be hospitalized in isolation off base, as have a total of at least six passengers who exhibited fever, cough or other possible symptoms of the disease upon their arrival at Travis and Miramar.\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 30,000 people and killed at least 600, most in and around Wuhan.\nThe CDC has said the risk of widespread transmission of the disease in the United States remains very low, but the Trump administration last week declared a U.S. public health emergency to ensure containment of the virus.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. All but two of the patients were infected while traveling to China. Just two cases are known to have been transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both spouses of individuals who were infected abroad.\nStarting this week, the U.S. government has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently been in China.\nThe CDC also has ordered mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited China’s Hubei Province, while Americans who were elsewhere in mainland China are subject to 14 days of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China are being directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers are screened by the CDC.

Major names such as Sony, Amazon, Nokia, LG and others had pulled out of the MWC.

'888888,0,LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was “too early” to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.\n'
'888888,0,So far, the death toll from the coronavirus epidemic in China has risen to 425, with more than 24000 confirmed infections and 349 deaths from SARS between 2002 and 2003, after the Chinese government announced 64 deaths on Tuesday February 4.\nFor the first time, the Chinese government has acknowledged its "shortcomings" in dealing with the public health crisis. Second new coronaviruses died in Hongkong outside mainland China.\nWith the stock market plummeting from China on Monday, the Chinese government, though taking different measures, was unable to stabilize the stock market volatility. China\'s Politburo is very rare to admit for the first time that "there are shortcomings and difficulties in dealing with public health crises such as epidemics.\nThe new coronavirus continues to spread and the Chinese government can hardly cope with it.\n'
'888888,0,China has increased to 25 number of fatalities in the new type of coronavirus, accounting 616 cases of the outbreak that started in the city of Wuhan. The epicenter of the epidemic was closed, with flights and train journeys to the region being suspended so that no one would leave or enter Wuhan. Residents of the city of Huanggang, more than 70 kilometers away, were advised not to leave the house.\nAccording to Sky News, which cites Chinese state television, transport in Huanggang was also suspended and facilities such as cinemas and cafes were closed. Wuhan and Huanggang have a joint population of over twenty million people.\nOutside mainland China, cases of the disease have been confirmed in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Thailand and the United States.\nThe first cases of the "2019-nCoV" virus appeared in mid-December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the capital of the central province of Hubei, when people with a viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals.\nIn all cases, patients often worked or visited the market for Wuhan shellfish and meat. The authorities are still unaware of the exact origin of the infection, but several indications point to infected animals, which are marketed alive, passing the disease on to humans.\nSymptoms of these coronaviruses ar e more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress, including shortness of breath.\nMacau denies entry and exit of people with fever\nIn an attempt to help contain the outbreak, Macao is refusing border entry and exit of people with fever\nYeah. Up to now, body temperature measurement was being carried out at the border entrance, but orders are now to carry out the same exit check, information that was underlined today at two press conferences, a first one promoted by the head of government, a second one at the end of the afternoon, provided by the health authorities.\nThe Macao authorities have today identified a second person infected with the new type of coronavirus, a 66-year-old man, who, like the first case, a 52-year-old woman, is from Wuhan. Currently in isolation, the clinical condition of both is considered stable.\n15 other people are currently in isolation, five of which are considered high-risk cases. Eight other people are in a special emergency waiting for the results of a screening test.\nThe outbreak comes at a time when millions of Chinese travel, on the occasion of the Lunar New Year, the main feast of Chinese families, equivalent to Christmas in Western countries. According to the Chinese Ministry of Transport, the country is to register a total of three billion domestic journeys over the next forty days.\nOver half a thousand reported cases have been fueling fears about a potential epidemic, similar to that of atypical pneumonia, or Severe Acute Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 killed 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong.\n'
"888888,1,Battling the fast-spreading coronavirus, China on Friday said that it is building a 1,000-bed hospital for patients infected with the deadly virus that has claimed 26 lives so far with confirmed cases rising sharply to over 880, prompting authorities to shut down 13 cities during the country's most important holiday.\nDampening the celebrations of the Lunar New Year, China, in an unprecedented move, has shut down transportation in at least 13 cities -- Wuhan and 12 of its neighbours -- in central China's Hubei province to contain the coronavirus.\nAccording to the National Health Commission, 26 people have died so far with over 880 confirmed cases being treated mostly in Hubei province. Twenty-nine provinces have reported the cases.\nChina's biggest city Shanghai raised the emergency response of public health safety to level 1, the highest, following Beijing, and Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Guangdong provinces as more cases were reported.\nBeijing so far reported 34 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, official media reported.\nThe Chinese disease prevention authority on Friday released pictures and information of the first Wuhan Coronavirus that Chinese experts had discovered.\nThe Wuhan local government is rushing to build a 1,000-bedded hospital in the outskirts of Wuhan to treat coronavirus patients.\nDozens of excavators were feverishly working at the site where the hospital will be built on the 25000 sq metres just about 10 days' time. It will be put into use by February 3, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\nWorkers are being paid 1,200 yuan (USD 173) per day, three times their usual wage, to accelerate the construction.\nThe hospital will be modelled on the one built in Beijing for the treatment and control of SARS or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that spread rapidly on the Chinese mainland in 2003, killing over 800 people. During that time Beijing had built the Xiaotangshan Hospital, a temporary medical centre in the northern suburb of the city.\nChina has also deployed its military medics to help civilian doctors.\nAs the unknown virus wreaking havoc, Chinese and American researchers are working together to develop a vaccine against the deadly new strain of coronavirus, Hong Kong based South China Morning Post reported.\nThe collaboration is taking place amid a growing international debate about whether it came from snakes or bats.\nAt present, there is no cure for the virus which has pneumonia-like symptoms and is contagious among humans.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus a global public health emergency, despite China’s climbing death toll.\nThe virus has spread to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States as of Thursday. Japan on Friday reported a second confirmed case.\nWuhan, the city of 11 million people, is where the virus is believed to have first emerged. The victims' average age is 73, with 89 being the oldest and 48 youngest.\nHubei authorities have suspended operations at local travel agencies and ordered all schools to postpone the start of spring semester classes, said People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).\nChina's finance ministry on Thursday announced the allocation of one billion yuan (USD 144 million) to be used by Hubei authorities to halt the spread of the illness, the report said.\nThe Indian Embassy in Beijing has cancelled the January 26th Republic Day ceremony citing the coronavirus outbreak in China as well as the decision of the Chinese authorities to cancel public gathering and events.\nThe Wuhan lockdown is a cause of concern for Indian students who are still there. The city and surroundings have about 700 Indian students, majority of them studying medicine.

The WHO on Tuesday announced the new name of the virus: Covid-19.\nPeople have been quick to spread hoaxes and misinformation, conspiracy theories and "cures" via social media without checking the authenticity of these messages.\nFact-checking organisations such as Africa Check and PolitiFact have been battling to keep up with quashing these messages, which in almost all cases turn out to be false.\nHere are some of the more recent fake claims about the most recent novel coronavirus:\n- \xa0Dettol surface cleanser can kill the 2019 coronavirus\nAccording to Africa Check, a photo doing the rounds on WhatsApp shows the label on a bottle of Dettol anti-bacterial surface cleanser.\n"The label says the cleanser is suitable for kitchen sinks, baths, taps, fridges and bins. It also says the liquid has been proven to kill bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella, as well as viruses such as coronavirus," Africa Check says on its website\xa0as well as its weekly podcast, What\'s Crap on WhatsApp?\n"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n"Previously, specific Dettol products have shown to be effective against certain strains of coronavirus. They include the Dettol disinfectant spray, liquid, surface cleanser and wipes.\n"But the coronavirus spreading at the moment, known as the 2019 \'novel\' coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has not yet been tested against Dettol products," says Africa Check.\n"Once health authorities make the strain available," Dettol will test its product range against it, the company notes on its website.\n- A university in Ghana has developed a coronavirus vaccine\nAgain, this is a hoax, says Africa Check.\nGhana\'s Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has not\xa0successfully created and tested a coronavirus vaccine, as claimed on the website News 7PM.\nThe claim was published on January 27 and has since been shared on Facebook and other websites.\nOn the same day the article appeared, the university issued a statement that reports of a vaccine were false, reported Africa Check.\n"The attention of management of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, has been drawn to the… headline circulating on social media on Monday, 27 January 2020," it read.\nThe statement is signed by Dr Daniel Bekoe, the university\'s relations officer.\n"A quick check with the dean of the faculty of pharmacy, Prof Berko Panyin Anto, on the above news reveals that no such discovery has occurred.\n"Again, we wish to state that the person alleged to have supervised the purported project (Professor Dr Israel Nluki) has no affiliations with KNUST.

'888888,0,Beijing, February 7 - Russia News Agency. Hubei Province has been the center of the epidemic since the outbreak of coronavirus, As a result, Russian ambassador to China Andrei Denisov told Russian reporters Friday that the harsh measures taken there to curb the spread of the disease are entirely reasonable.\nI would like to remind you that Hubei is indeed a polluted area and the center of the epidemic, so those very strict measures are very close to the military status, "Under the current situation, the measures taken by the Chinese government in Hubei Province and Wuhan city are undoubtedly reasonable."\nSince the outbreak of the coronavirus on January 23, Wuhan has been isolated from the rest of the world, and the traffic in the city has been interrupted, including subway, bus, ferry, etc, Buses and water transport were not allowed to enter the city, and take-off from airports and railway stations were cancelled, The city and state authorities suggested that there was no particular reason not to go or leave the city. Similar measures have been taken in several other cities in Hubei Province.\nChinese authorities informed the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019 that an unknown outbreak of pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, central China\nAbout Experts found the pathogen of the disease - Colorado virus 2019 ncov. The number of new coronavirus infections in China has reached 636, with more than 311000 infected.\n'
"888888,0,The Coronavirus spreads again more rapidly after the increase of new diseases had decreased slightly two days in a row. Throughout China, 34.546 infections have been confirmed. According to the National Health Commission, this is 3.399 more than a day before. The number of deaths increased by 86 to 722.\n24.953 confirmed infections with the pathogen 2019-nCoV and 81 new fatalities are now reported from the central Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus originally broke out in the Wuhan metropolis.\nIn China, the first foreign casualties have also been confirmed. As the US Embassy in Beijing reported on Saturday, a 60-year-old US citizen infected with the virus arrived in Wuhan on the 6th. February for life. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. According to this, it was a man in his sixties who was suspected of being infected with the virus. The patient suffered from severe pneumonia.\nChinese state television reports that a second new hospital has been opened for coronary cases. The first doctors\nand nursing teams have already arrived, on Saturday the first\nPatients are admitted to the 1.500-bed clinic. I\nOn Monday, a new hospital was opened for the isolation of coronary patients. The construction of the 60.000 square meter large building with 30 intensive care stations had eight days.\nIt was built by 7.000 specialists from containers.\nOutside mainland China, there are more than two dozen cases over 270, of which 14 in Germany. Another case of infection, the 12th, has been detected in Bavaria. The Bavarian Ministry of Health informs us. This is the wife of a man who works for the car supplier Webasto and was tested positive for the virus last week\nYeah. The patient is now being medically monitored like her husband and treated in isolation in a Munich clinic, it was said. Further details were not provided by the Ministry.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. Am 21\nYeah. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite.\nYeah. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nIn France, according to the government, five British citizens have been diagnosed with coronary infection. They would have stayed in the same accommodation in the French Alps as another Brit who had arrived from Singapore and had been diagnosed shortly before, says Minister of Health Agnes Buzyn. Among the newly infected, there was also a child. The group had been admitted to a hospital in the region in good health.\nIn the meantime, the Federal Government is having other Germans and their relatives brought back from Wuhan. About twenty people are expected at Tegel Airport on Sunday, the Berlin Senate Health Administration announced. After their arrival, it was planned to accommodate the Germans cautiously for 14 days in isolation on the premises of the DRK clinics in Berlin-Copenhagen. The city was well prepared, said Health Senator Dilek Kalayci. An official physician will receive the people in the military part of Tegel Airport, after which they will be tested for the virus. Results are expected on Monday afternoon.\nBecause of the new lung disease, the German army had already brought back Germans and their relatives from the town of Wuhan, which was heavily affected by the Coronavirus, in early February. Around 120 passengers of the flight have been quarantined since their return to a barracks in the Palatinate Germersheim. Two passengers had detected the virus.\nIn Hong Kong, however, the quarantine measures began: since Friday, all mainland Chinese immigrants have been carefully quarantined. 161 People have been affected so far, almost all are Hong Kong people, said Prime Minister Carrie Lam\nYeah. 148 People would have to remain quarantined in their homes and apartments, eleven would be in hotels and two in extra camps. There will be controls and anyone who violates the quarantine order will have to expect a prison sentence of up to six months and a fine.\nMeanwhile, Chinese scientists suspect that the new virus could also be transmitted via faeces. Some patients in a hospital in Wuhan would have had diarrhoea and nausea before the onset of fever symptoms and difficulty breathing, according to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The main route of transmission of the virus continues to be a drop infection via the cough of a patient.\nIn ten percent of 138 patients, the disease course started with diarrhoea and nausea, researchers write. They indicated that in the early cases of the first disease in Wuhan in December they focused mainly on respiratory symptoms. Symptoms associated with the digestive tract may have been overlooked.\nKnowledge of an infectious pathway through faeces is not entirely surprising to science, as the Sars virus also partially transmitted during the epidemic in the early 2000s. Sars is caused by coronary viruses as well as the novel disease.\nRead all about the new Coronavirus on our topic page.\n"

'888888,0,HOUSTON:\xa0Authorities in Texas are investigating a second suspected case on US soil of a deadly Chinese virus, namely a college student who had recently returned from the city at the heart of the outbreak, officials said on Thursday (Jan 23). \n Brazos County, just northwest of Houston, "is investigating a suspected case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)," its health authority wrote in a statement on Facebook. \n "The patient travelled from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated," it added. \n The patient\'s age is somewhere between 20 and 30 and they returned to the United States, where they are attending Texas A&M University, days before health screenings began at airports on Jan\xa015, local health official Eric Wilke told reporters. \n "The person presented to an area emergency department yesterday mostly out of concern, not out of symptoms," said Wilke, adding that they were now being kept isolated at home while testing was performed, with the result likely to arrive over the next day or two. \n The patient had "mild upper respiratory symptoms" including cough and congestion and appeared to be improving. Such symptoms are common in the middle of winter flu season, but the patient was being screened further on the basis of their travel history. \n A blood sample has been sent to the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, which should arrive late Thursday or early Friday, with a result expected within 24 hours after that. \n If the case is confirmed, the patient would be the second person to be infected with the pathogen on US soil after a man in his 30s near Seattle reported himself to authorities on Jan\xa019. \n That man, a US resident who also recently travelled to Wuhan, is said to be recovering well and is due to be released from hospital soon. \n CDC officials had already warned that there would be more cases in the US given the frequency of international travel. \n All air traffic from Wuhan is currently being funnelled through five airports where health officials have been deployed to carry out screening with questionnaires and temperature checks. \n The new respiratory virus has claimed 18 lives since emerging from a seafood and animal market in Wuhan and infected hundreds more. \n China has locked down some 20 million people at the epicenter of the outbreak, but the World Health Organisation said on Thursday the disease did not yet constitute a global health emergency. \n But it has generated alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n '
'888888,0,SINGAPORE — ComfortDelGro cabbies and Grab private-hire drivers will be receiving more help from their respective companies to mitigate falling fares due to the Covid-19 outbreak. \n This is separate from the S$77 million package that the Government introduced last week to help embattled taxi and private-hire drivers. \n ComfortDelGro Taxi said on Thursday (Feb 20) it will be providing cabbies with rental rebates until the end of April 2020, which will cost the company S$10 million. \n “We have been monitoring the situation very closely and have received feedback from our cabbies who have been asking for help,” said Mr Ang Wei Neng, the chief executive of ComfortDelGro Taxi, in a press release. \n From Feb 21 until the end of March 2020, a daily rental rebate of S$16.50 will be given to each taxi, amounting to S$660 for the period. \n This will be followed by a daily S$10 rebate for the entire month of April. \n The help package announced last week will see drivers receiving up to S$20 per vehicle per day for three months, contributed equally by the Government and operators. \n For ComfortDelGro cabbies, the new rebates mean that they will get a daily rental reduction of S$36.50 till the end of March, S$30 till the end of April and S$20 till May 13. \n The extra financial assistance comes amid falling demand for taxi services due to the Covid-19 outbreak. \n With tourist arrivals plummeting and an increasing number of companies allowing their staff to work from home to reduce the risk of infection, cabbies have seen their income drop between 20 per cent and 30 per cent. \n “We felt that we needed to do more. Hopefully this latest package will help our cabbies ride through the tough times,” said Mr Ang. \n “We will continue to watch the situation closely and do more if needed.” \n GRAB DOLES OUT ITS OWN INCENTIVES \n On the same day, ride-hailing company Grab also announced its plan to assist its drivers. \n It is part of the Special Relief Fund that was announced last week. \n Eligible drivers will receive up to S$85 per week to supplement their fare earnings between March 2 and May 30. \n This is in addition to the Government’s support of S$70 per week. \n In total, those who are eligible for the Special Relief Fund will receive up to S$155 per week, or up to about S$2,000 for the entire period, on top of their fare earnings. \n “We have been working hard to minimise the impact of the Covid-19 situation on their livelihoods in the past weeks,” said Mr Andrew Chan, Grab Singapore’s head of transport. \n Grab is devoting a total of over S$17 million towards safeguarding its drivers’ well-being and livelihoods, the company said. \n Grab is also providing additional income support and rental waivers for drivers who may be placed under quarantine, or has been given leave of absence or hospitalised. \n Drivers also get free insurance that covers them in the event that they are diagnosed with Covid-19. \n AID FOR AVIATION SECTOR \n Separately, Changi Airport Group (CAG) has also announced details of its assistance packages to help beleaguered firms. \n All airlines that operate flights between mainland China and Singapore will get “landing credits”, CAG said in a statement. \n Carriers like Singapore Airlines that continue to operate scheduled passenger flights between mainland China and Singapore during the outbreak period will get a 100 per cent landing charge rebate for these flights. \n Singapore carriers operating scheduled flights will also get rebates on parking and landing charges, as well as regulatory fees. \n Meanwhile, retail, food and beverage, and service operators at Changi Airport will receive a 50 per cent rebate on their basic rentals for six months from February. \n This is in addition to an automatic rental offset tied to passenger movements at Changi Airport. \n Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that the S$20 rebate for ComfortDelGro cabbies will last until the end of May. This is incorrect. The rebate ends on May 13. We are sorry for the error. \n '
'888888,0,Singapore\'s Lianhe Zaobao signature Yu Zeyuan commented: "most people did not think a few days ago that the Chinese New Year\'s coronavirus (commonly known as Wuhan pneumonia) will be shrouded in the rat\'s Spring Festival. In order to prevent further spread of the epidemic, from January 23, Wuhan City, Hubei Province and surrounding cities such as Ezhou City, Xiantao City, Qianjiang City, Huanggang City, Jingmen City, etc. announced to suspend the operation of urban transportation vehicles, and closed the airport, railway station, highway and other access channels, which is also known as "Fengcheng". City closures and strict prevention and control measures not only make the festival atmosphere dignified, but also bring many inconveniences to people\'s lives. Although the Spring Festival Gala programs of CCTV and other provinces and cities are still singing, people in reality are praying and blessing peace, Xin Qiji, Huo Qubing, Kang Youwei and other historical celebrities have become hot words for new year\'s Eve. However, few people complain that these prevention and control measures are too harsh; on the contrary, the public is more critical of Wuhan city and Hubei Province for failing to strictly control the epidemic in the first time. "\n"More than 5 million people have left Wuhan because of the Spring Festival and the epidemic," Zhou Xianwang, mayor of Wuhan, said at a press conference on the evening of the second day of the new year. The news caused a great shock. Where have all about 5000000 people gone? How many of them are carriers of the new coronavirus? How many human infections do they cause? These questions are very worrying indeed. " "From the initial situation, Wuhan failed to seal the new coronavirus within the minimum range at the first time. Frankly speaking, our first battle was bad. When we find out a disease, we can\'t find out which disease we used to be familiar with. It\'s unique without any record. Secondly, modern medicine has no medicine that can effectively fight against it. There is no way to take it. At this time, we should attach great importance to it and take the most resolute isolation treatment measures. However, Wuhan\'s actual response measures were obviously slow, without comprehensive isolation treatment and blocking all potential channels of infection, so that the virus spread to the whole country. This is another painful lesson. "\n"Wuhan is the transportation hub of the mainland. Ships in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, national high-speed trains and long-distance buses across the province are bound to pass through Wuhan," said an editorial signed by Lu Feng in Hong Kong\'s apple daily. Millions of people flow in and out of Wuhan every day. When a new coronavirus appears in Wuhan and can be passed on from person to person, other cities as far as Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing will soon have cases of infection\n。 But the governments of these cities are as good as nothing. Even when there are confirmed cases in Thailand and Japan, other provinces and cities in the mainland still haven\'t reported any suspected cases, let alone confirmed cases. In terms of the number and distance of people flow, the number of people flow from Wuhan to Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen must be dozens of times more than that to Japan and Thailand. How can it be that there have been several confirmed cases in foreign countries, while the mainland provinces and cities keep zero infection instead! In addition to the domestic clowns don\'t want to be passed on, in addition to the provincial and municipal governments pretending to be ignorant, what is the explanation? "\nThe editorial system of the Chinese World Journal said: "there is a huge lack of system from top to bottom. On the evening of 20, Xi Jinping delivered a new coronavirus speech in CCTV, requiring all local governments to do well in epidemic prevention and control, and maintain the overall social stability. Before and after his speech, great changes took place in the whole Chinese officialdom; after his speech, Wuhan and all parts of the country announced the number of new virus infections, which increased rapidly every day, shocking the world. But the figures released every day are in sharp contrast to the downplay and concealment of the epidemic by local officials before Xi\'s speech. " "Why is there such a huge gap before and after the speech? Because the central authorities have strict control and carry out the system from top to bottom, any major event must be reported at all levels. The lower officials have no decision-making power. They must report to the higher authorities for approval. The Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau has no right to dare to announce the epidemic situation. They must report to the provincial government. The governor and the provincial Party Secretary will report to the central authorities again and report to Xi Jinping\'s confidant at last. The confidant took many factors into consideration, figured out what he wanted to do, decided how to report to the study, he did not like to listen to the reports, he only wanted to listen to the top down system and the reporting process at all levels. It was one month after the outbreak of the epidemic that he only reported to Xi Jinping. The delay in decision-making led to the rapid spread of the epidemic\n'

'888888,0,But what did China do? Hua Chunying said that China, in a responsible manner, "has informed the US of the epidemic information and prevention and control measures 30 times since January 3. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention of the two countries have communicated with each other for many times on the epidemic situation.\nWhat caused netizens\' outrage was that the pneumonia in Wuhan became more and more severe, which caused a national panic. The key problem was that the public knew too late. At the beginning, the authorities did not report the epidemic to the society in time, instead, they suppressed eight doctors who dared to speak, and ordered some doctors to sign documents such as letters of repentance.\nOn Monday, for the first time, many Chinese heard from a spokesman of the Chinese foreign ministry. Since January 3, when the vast majority of Chinese people were still in the dark, China has begun to report the epidemic information to the United States, a total of 30 times. Generally speaking, Chinese people know about the situation, about after academician Zhong Nanshan revealed the message of Wuhan pneumonia on January 20. But the leaders of Hubei and Wuhan authorities were still in "group worship" on January 21 to watch art performances. Wuhan people and even the whole of China were not frightened until Wuhan was closed on the 23rd. That is to say, until the outbreak in Wuhan completely out of control!\nAt present, it is recognized that the earliest time to detect the epidemic is December 8. Even if the Beijing authorities can report the epidemic to the American public on January 3, the epidemic will not spread to the later stage. Wuhan city will not suddenly announce the closure of the city late on the 23rd night, which is the result of everyone\'s surprise and panic.\nSome netizens said: "I told the Americans on January 3, but I didn\'t tell us the people of Hubei. I can\'t believe it if it\'s not officially announced by myself.".\nAnother netizen commented: the Chinese official said that since the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, 30 times of China\'s epidemic situation had been reported to the U.S., "people\'s wrath! While catching the doctors who published the true information of the virus, they kept reporting to the U.S. while not telling the truth! They kept hiding the key points of the people for 20 days. What kind of regime is this? They regard the people as grass mustard and ruminant dogs!"\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist, commented: has the foreign ministry missed the point? I know everything from top to bottom, but I have to hide the Chinese people. How can I hate them to do this\n。\nCompared with Wuhan pneumonia, influenza is said to be ignorant\nA spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry criticized the United States for not helping China in real terms. It cited the example of the US influenza to compare with the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed in China. It said that "the 2019-2020 influenza season in the United States has infected 19 million people and at least ten thousand people have died."\nBut experts believe that the flu can not be compared with Wuhan pneumonia or SARS at all. First, the case fatality rate is not in an order of magnitude. The case fatality rate of SARS is 10%, and that of Wuhan pneumonia is 3%. However, according to the statement that more than 10 million people in the United States are infected with influenza and nearly 10000 people died, the case fatality rate is only 0.05%. The severity varies, and many flu strains have vaccines.\nHua Chunying is here to talk about the U.S. flu, deliberately ignoring the situation in China. In fact, according to the report of the lancet quoted by the Southern Metropolis Daily on September 21 last year, 88000 people die of influenza every year in China, far more than the official data.\nChina treats us and Russia differently\nHua Chunying\'s purpose in taking this example is to show that the US side is not enough. According to Hua Chunying\'s statement, China\'s accusation against the United States is mainly that the United States "made a special response to the Chinese epidemic and took excessive measures, which obviously ran counter to the WHO recommendations".\nTo prevent the outbreak, Russia, which is close to China, recently blocked the 4250 km border between Russia and China, cut off the railway lines between the two countries, restricted flights, restricted Chinese tourists and suspended the issuance of visas to Chinese workers. What\'s more, Russian Prime Minister announced on Monday that he would take severe measures to deport Russian patients infected with the new coronavirus, which is also considered to be aimed at the Chinese.\nInternet users commented on Russia\'s move that "only the powerful people with centralized power can take such anti humanitarian measures to seal up cities and expel foreigners".\nBut China does not say a word about this extreme measure.\n'

There were also only three new cases outside Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, the lowest since the commission began tracking daily cases on Jan. 20.\nA total of 2,870 people have died from the outbreak in mainland China and 79,824 have been infected by the virus.\nChinese officials have reiterated that efforts to curb the outbreak are achieving positive results, with the daily new cases being reported trending lower in recent weeks.\nTo cushion the economic impact of the epidemic, China has ordered districts to be classified into “high-risk”, “medium-risk” and “low-risk”, with the latter expected to end traffic curbs and let everyone resume work.\nOn Saturday, Hubei said 11 of its 103 counties had reported no new cases for at least 14 days, meeting “low-risk” criteria. But as many as 58 of its counties are still deemed “high-risk”.\nChina needs to take a long-term view of the outbreak and plug loopholes in its laws and emergency response mechanisms, President Xi Jinping said in speeches published in the Communist Party’s theoretical journal, Qiushi (Seeking Truth), on Sunday.\nChina must set up an emergency reserve and supply system to ensure vital materials are deployed at critical times, he added.\nAs coronavirus cases spread overseas, Beijing is starting to raise its guard to avoid a resurgence of the outbreak through travelers from other countries.\nMore than 50 countries have reported cases with Mexico and San Marino the latest additions. In a bulletin issued Saturday, the World Health Organization said there were 6,009 cases outside China, an increase of 1,318 from the previous day.\nChina has refrained from blanket travel bans, but some local governments, such as in Beijing, have ordered self-quarantine for travelers from countries where the virus has spread.\nBeijing on Sunday reported two new cases: both are Chinese nationals who recently returned from Iran, where the coronavirus cases have multiplied quickly.\nChina will take steps to bring back citizens from high-risk countries if necessary, foreign ministry official Cui Aimin told reporters on Sunday. He said Beijing has arranged 10 flights to bring home 1,314 so far, but did not name any countries.\n'

'888888,0,CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday alerted Americans to begin preparing for the spread of coronavirus in the United States after infections surfaced in several more countries.\nThe announcement signaled a change in tone for the Atlanta-based U.S. health agency, which had largely been focused on efforts to stop the virus from entering the country and quarantining individuals traveling from China.\n“The data over the past week about the spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and expectation that we are going to have community spread here,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the CDC’s head of respiratory diseases, told reporters on a conference call.\nWhat is not known, she said, is when it will arrive and how severe a U.S. outbreak might be. “Disruption to everyday life might be severe” and businesses, schools and families should begin having discussions about the possible impact from the spread of the virus, Messonnier cautioned.\nIn a teleconference later on Tuesday, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said that while the immediate risk in the United States was low, the current global situation suggested a pandemic was likely.\n“It’s not a question of if. It’s a question of when and how many people will be infected,” Schuchat said.\nIn San Francisco, California’s fourth-largest city, officials declared a local emergency, despite having no coronavirus cases, in an effort to raise public awareness of the virus’ risks and boost preparedness.\nSeparately, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told a Senate subcommittee there will likely be more cases in the United States, and he asked lawmakers to approve $2.5 billion in funding to fight the outbreak after proposing cuts to the department’s budget.\n“While the immediate risk to individual members of the American public remains low, there is now community transmission in a number of countries, including outside of Asia, which is deeply concerning,” Azar said, adding that recent outbreaks in Iran and Italy were particularly worrying.\nBelieved to have originated from illegal wildlife sold in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected some 80,000 people and killed close to 2,700 in China.\nAlthough the World Health Organization says the epidemic has peaked in China, coronavirus cases have surfaced in about 30 other countries, with some three dozen deaths reported, according to a Reuters tally.\nGrowing outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea have raised concerns that coronavirus will surface in other nations and worsen in those that have already reported infections, further denting a global economy that had already been hit by a dependence on China.\nGlobal and U.S. stock markets fell sharply again on Tuesday, as investors feared the epidemic would further damage an already slowing world economy.\nThe White House’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the U.S. economy would be able to ride out any disruption from the global spread of coronavirus, adding that he did not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to blunt the disease’s economic impact.\nU.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, however, said Republican President Donald Trump and his administration had been caught “flat-footed” and lacked a comprehensive plan to deal with the coronavirus. He called for at least $3.1 billion in additional funding to fight it.\n“The Trump administration has shown towering and dangerous incompetence when it comes to the coronavirus,” said Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat. “Mr. President, you need to get your act together now. This is a crisis.”\nTrump defended his administration’s response. “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world,” Trump said on Twitter.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it would be at least a year before a coronavirus vaccine could be made available to the public.\nBut Fauci said testing Gilead Sciences’ (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir for potential treatment of coronavirus could be done in a “reasonable amount of time.”\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that Iran may have covered up information about the spread of coronavirus there, and he accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of media and medical professionals.\n“The United States is deeply concerned by information indicating the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,” Pompeo told reporters as Iran’s coronavirus death toll rose to 16.\n“All nations, including Iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,” Pompeo said.\nHis remarks, coming less than two months after a short-lived U.S.-Iranian military clash and the signing of a U.S.-China trade deal, could inflame tensions with Tehran and Beijing.\nBeijing last week revoked the credentials of three Wall Street Journal correspondents over a column China said was racist. The United States has said it was considering a range of responses to their expulsion.\n“Expelling our journalists exposes once again the government’s issue that led to SARS and now the coronavirus: namely censorship. It can have deadly consequences,” Pompeo said, referring to the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also emerged from China.\n“If China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge” of coronavirus, he added.\nDespite the coronavirus epidemic, Pompeo said the United States still planned to host a special meeting with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Las Vegas in March.\n'

'888888,0,The spread of covid-19 once again challenges the unity of Europe. Members of the most affected communities, such as Italy and Spain, have to wait for help from Beijing, not Brussels.\nWithout China, Europe cannot protect itself from the corona disaster. In any case, the president of Serbia, Alexander vuccic, is convinced of this. He believes that the unity of the whole Europe is on paper, but at a critical moment, real aid can only come from Beijing. This was announced by the president of the Republic after the declaration of a state of emergency.\nTell me who your friend is\n"We cannot import medical equipment from European Union countries," Ursula von der lain, President of the European Commission, said recently\nBrussels does ban the provision of medical equipment to non EU members to protect its resources in the event of a pandemic. Serbia is currently only a candidate country and therefore does not qualify for assistance.\n"It\'s the right decision because it\'s the device we need for our health," he wrote on his twitter\nOn the one-on-one issue, Serbia seeks China\'s assistancAbout Recently, countries have stepped up cooperation, so Belgrade is often criticized in Brussels.\n"I wrote a letter to President Xi, in which for the first time he officially referred to him as not only a dear friend, but also a brother, not only my personal friend, but also a friend and brother of the country." -Vuccic stressed. He asked China to provide all necessary help to fight the Colorado virus - "even send us doctors because our doctors are exhausted."\nEveryone for himself\nHowever, practice shows that Brussels cannot help not only its neighbours, but also EU members. Last month, when covid-19 spread rapidly in Italy, Rome sought EU assistance through the emergency coordination centre. " We have asked for medical equipment, and the European Commission has sent this call to all States parties, Mauricio Massari, permanent representative of Italy to the European Union, said. But it doesn\'t work. "\nAt that time, no EU country provided assistance to Italy. This is a real tragedy for a country where, as of 19 March, the total number of people infected with coronavirus has exceeded 35000 and the number of deaths has reached nearly 3000. Italian doctors have to work day and night in the face of a continuous shortage of equipment and materialAbout In many other countries in the European Union, the pollution situation is relatively calm, and these countries themselves have received Brussels\'s assistance many times. Especially Eastern European countries. But no country is in a hurry to help its most affected neighbours. On March 13 alone, Italian media reported that Germany intended to "send millions of masks to Italy". This is the only assistance Rome has received from its EU colleagues in the fight against covid-19.\nIn Italy\'s view, Europe once again left on its own in a serious crisis, as in the euro crisis after 2008. Then, in the refugee crisis that began in 2015, and now in overcoming the virus crisis in 2020, experts pointed out in the article that, "International policy and society".\nItaly, after all, has support. At midnight on March 12, a Chinese plane landed in Rome. There were nine medical experts and 31 tons of medical supplies on board, including special care facilities. Personal protective equipment and antiviral drugs. At about the same time, a Chinese truck carrying 230 boxes of medical equipment arrived in Italy. In a telephone conversation with Italian foreign minister Luigi de Mayo, his colleague Wang Guangya promised to send more money to Rome than he didAbout However, even if the help is two days after the call.\nChina emergency rescue\nIt turns out that in a pandemic in Europe, China wants more than Serbia or Italy. The foreign minister of the Kingdom has promised medical assistance to Spain, the second EU contaminated country. A cargo plane from Shanghai landed at Zaragoza airport on Tuesday, delivering 500000 medical masks to the UK. Another $300000 Belgium received masks from Chinese charities set up by Alibaba. Xinhua "released a picture of a container with the slogan" act as one, in French, Flemish and Chinese. ".\nAnd Poland will get $10000 from China Tests for coronavirus and protective clothing for doctors. France has also received assistance from Beijing, which has declared the epidemic a third level.\nOn Wednesday, a Chinese plane carrying anti-virus equipment landed in France. On the plane, there are about one million masks and protective gloves. Another plane will arrive from China on Thursday, "French Foreign Minister Jean Yves ledrian said on bfmtv television. He stressed that the cooperation between France and China in disease prevention and control is successful. " We used to work together to protect ChinAbout Now China responds to our actions with a gesture of solidarity, which we appreciate. " In addition, China is committed to simplifying the procedures for the supply of drugs to the EU through commercial channels.\nChina\'s assistance is not limited to European countries. The government and non-governmental organizations provided doctors and medicines to Cambodia, Iran, Iraq, the Philippines and other countries. For example, billionaire Jackie Ma donated 1000000 medical masks and hundreds of thousands of tests to the United States. In addition, Amnesty International announced that it would send 20000 "Afghan refugees". Test package, 100000 sets (thousands of US dollars) UNCTAD also provided technical assistance to African countries.\nNew solidarity\nThe EU has always maintained that it is not just an economic or political union, but a community of ideas and values. But the story of covid-19 makes it clear that these values are not based on helping each other. After the end of the crisis with the Colorado virus, Europe\'s coordinated policies need to be reassessed. Otherwise, the new challenges will continue to threaten the unity of the alliance.\nThe dependence of EU Member States on China\'s aid not only reflects the difficulties within Europe. Particularly unfavourable in the context of the crisis is the reaction of Brussels, the main ally of the United StateAbout When Beijing sends aid and experts to the European Union, trap closes the border to keep Europeans out of its country.\nBut China has successfully demonstrated to the EU who their true and reliable partners are. This is a major achievement of our foreign policy. Especially in recent years, the West has demonized Beijing more and more. The Chinese government has played an important role in helping the EU, even in the World Health Organization. Her director, teros Adana gugliese, called it "a model of solidarity between China and Italy.". This will help China more effectively implement its infrastructure plan within the EU, especially the development project "one belt one road". Premier Li Keqiang expressed confidence in a telephone conversation with Ursula The bilateral relations between China and the EU in the process of jointly fighting against pneumonia will be further strengthened. He added that China intends to strengthen cooperation with European countries in the economic field and continue to strengthen investment ties.\nIn this case, some experts believe that China is actively involved in the fight against the "soft power" epidemic. About\n"The Chinese government is trying to extend its power beyond the border and establish China as a world leader, doing what the U.S. government has done for nearly a century, and "The distribution of medical assistance is part of this task," said Dr. Yang Yang, a researcher at Cornell University, Column of "Chinese Journal of science".\nEven so, it is difficult to argue with China\'s leadership in the fight against the Libyan Arab Emirates. For the first time in 24 hours since the outbreak of Colorado virus in China, no cases have been found nationwide, according to China\'s National Health Commission. Doctors deal only with intruders.\nDmitry beliaye'

'888888,0,When the severe acute respiratory (Sars) epidemic ended in 2003, many people in China thought that the government had learned its lesson. \n Sars was the most serious epidemic the country encountered in the reform era, killing 349 people in China. \n The government was roundly criticised for its cover-ups in the early phases of the epidemic, leading to some frantic bureaucratic reshuffles, greater transparency and an expensive control and prevention system for infectious diseases. \n In March 2019, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Gao Fu confidently predicted that China would never again suffer from another Sars-like epidemic. \n Mr Gao is facing a storm of anger for this prediction since the outbreak in December 2019 of new coronavirus Covid-19, which has caused infections and deaths than Sars. \n As of March 7, according to the World Health Organization, Covid-19 has caused 3,073 deaths and infected 80,813 people in China, with hundreds of thousands more under medical observation. \n A medical and humanitarian tragedy has wreaked havoc in Wuhan city and Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic. \n A widely circulated social-media article describes 11 striking mistakes China has repeated this time around. \n The most grievous failings are the government cover-ups and censorship in the early phases of the epidemic which cost the country a precious three weeks in January to fight the virus. \n The most notorious cover-up surrounded Dr Li Wenliang, the now renowned whistle-blower who drew attention to early cases of Covid-19 infection. \n The police admonished him for warning people about the virus on social media and he later died from the infection himself. \n As news of his death began to circulate online on the evening of Feb 6 Feb, there was an outpouring of mourning and anger — too much for the censors to manage. \n Dr Li is already a martyr in the eyes of his mourners. But will the present crisis tragically embodied by his death spur China to learn any real lessons? \n Leaning from history is one of the most difficult skills for humankind to master. \n German philosopher Hegel once cynically remarked that “the only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history”. \n Twentieth-century American philosopher George Santayana offered a dark warning that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”. \n The value of historical learning is just as venerated in the Chinese tradition. The great 11th-century classic work of Chinese historiography Comprehensive Mirror to Aid Governance by Zi Zhi Tong Jian trawls the entirety of Chinese history up to that point for lessons in politics and governance. \n Courageous Chinese intellectuals are signing online letters calling for the authorities to respect freedom of speech, supposedly guaranteed by the country’s constitution. \n They believe that if freedom of speech as an individual right were protected, voices like Dr Li’s would have been heard more widely and effectively, perhaps forestalling the spread. If Dr Li’s death led to real freedom of speech in China, that would be a lesson well learned. \n But there is no sign as yet of such learning taking place. No sooner had demands for freedom of expression gained traction than they too fell victim to censors. \n Information control is hardening, not loosening. Truthful depictions of the tolls of the crisis in Wuhan are condemned as rumours and swiftly deleted. \n This happened to Fang Fang, a resident of Wuhan and professional writer whose first-hand blogs of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in her city have gripped millions of readers. \n The length to which the censors have gone to eliminate dissent is extraordinary. On Feb 22, authorities killed an article run by the official Xinhua News Agency for its assertion that “the sky is not going to fall upon the telling of truth”. \n A more promising avenue for learning is governance reform. This is where most Chinese discussions on managing the epidemic are centred. \n Various experts are weighing in on the need for institutional reform. Unlike Western commentaries which tend to blame the authoritarian system of President Xi Jinping, Chinese scholars raise a multitude of questions beyond politics. \n These include concerns about state–society relations, centre–local relations and the role of social organisations (including non-governmental organisations) and professional groups. \n While the rigidity of the Chinese system and the consequent governance failure are part of their criticisms, their comments are more nuanced and fine-tuned. \n Some of these views may reach the very top of the Chinese system, but it is unclear how the leadership will learn from this crisis. \n There are likely to be plenty of technical fixes, such as those recently announced by President Xi. \n But will the learning be so deep as to inaugurate systemic governance reforms and ensure long-term progress? \n As China continues its fight against Covid-19, the best hope is that the country can learn real lessons from this crisis and prove Hegel wrong.

'888888,0,SHANGHAI, March 17 (Reuters) - The rest of the world should learn from China and follow the principles of early detection, early quarantine and early treatment in order to halt the global spread of the coronavirus, the official China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday.\nThough the coronavirus was first discovered last year in the city of Wuhan, where officials initially tried to cover up the outbreak, China has sought to emphasise the positive role it has played in controlling the global spread of the disease.\nWith the number of new domestic cases dwindling, China has now turned its attention to controlling new infections coming into the country from overseas, where the pandemic continues to spread.\nChina Daily said Singapore, Japan and South Korea had all “based their responses on the experience and lessons drawn from China’s successful battle with the virus”, and China was now “proactively sharing” its best practices.\nBut not all countries are paying attention, increasing the possibility that the epidemic will get worse, the newspaper said.\n“(D)espite the unmistakable seriousness of the situation, some countries have tried to play down the risks, and the measures they have taken are not only insufficient to control the pandemic at home, but also not enough to prevent themselves from being the source of virus transmission to other countries,” it said.\nIt said “the drastically worsening situations” in some countries showed the importance of targeted measures to improve quarantine and treatment, and they should also strengthen communication and cooperation to better coordinate their efforts.\nChinese President Xi Jinping told United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week that China’s efforts to control the outbreak had given the world “precious time” to formulate their own responses.\nChina and the United States have been in a war of words about the pandemic, with many senior U.S. government officials, including President Donald Trump, continuing to refer to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus”.\nTop Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday that attempts by U.S. politicians to denigrate China’s efforts to curb the coronavirus would not succeed, and could lead to retaliation.

'888888,0,Anxiety is creeping up as the virus which originated in Wuhan spreads around the world, showing no sign as yet of abating. \n Singapore is at code orange in its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition, a crisis management system drafted and refined after Singapore\'s experience of tackling the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003. \n It was at yellow for days before being raised to orange on Friday evening, after a few local cases emerged without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. \n Will it move to red, which would mean the virus is severe and spreading widely? \n From what is known publicly, the coronavirus appears to be more infectious than Sars, which hit Singapore in 2003 from March to May, infecting 238 and killing 33. \n Sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide over several months, and killed about 774. \n However, the coronavirus appears less deadly, with a mortality rate of about 2 per cent, compared with Sars\' 9.6 per cent. \n The Middle East respiratory syndrome virus in 2012 infected about 2,500 people worldwide but was deadlier, with a fatality rate of 34 per cent. \n With the coronavirus, as of yesterday, more than 34,000 have been infected since December, and more than 700 have died in China. \n In Singapore, there are 40 infected persons as of yesterday. \n Outside of Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, the mortality rate is only 0.2 per cent so far, while seasonal influenza has a death rate of 0.1 per cent. This makes the new virus much closer to influenza than Sars. \n Sars was spread by people after they developed symptoms like fever; 2019-nCoV, as the new virus is officially known, appears to be sneakier, and can spread from an infected person who shows no symptoms. \n This makes the coronavirus harder to detect and easier to spread. The odds of it spiralling out of control within the community are thus higher than with Sars\n. \n However, initial reports suggest that it does not make people as sick as Sars did. Some doctors are already predicting that this coronavirus may be more like influenza - many people could get infected with mild sickness; a small proportion (now 15 per cent) will get seriously sick but will recover; and a tiny fraction (now 2 per cent) may die. \n In May 2009, the H1N1 outbreak from the United States surged into Singapore. By the time it came under control in February 2010, 415,000 people here had been infected, and 420,000 had been vaccinated. \n In the end, 18 people here died of the H1N1 virus, which remains the dominant flu strain globally and in Singapore. It is highly infectious, but people have come to terms with living with it, as it has a low fatality rate of 0.02 per cent. \n Will the coronavirus turn out to be a highly infectious non-event? Or a fast-spreading virus that kills a large number in its wake? \n So far, several experts have predicted it will be the former. \n Meanwhile, China is patenting a drug found to be highly effective in treating the disease. Many labs around the world are also vying to be the first to develop a vaccine. \n Singaporeans should educate and update themselves on the virus so that they can make rational, sensible choices for themselves and their families. \n In Singapore, it is clear that political leaders are trying to prepare Singaporeans for the long haul. No one can predict for sure how this virus outbreak will pan out. But the experience of Sars gives some pointers. \n I am the author of a book on Sars. Titled A Defining Moment: How Singapore Beat Sars, it was published in 2004, and it details Singapore\'s whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach to battling the virus. (The book is out of print, but can be borrowed from the National Library.) \n Drawing from what we went through with Sars, we can better prepare ourselves for the long battle against the coronavirus\n. \n One key takeaway from that experience is that when there is wide community spread, the battle against the virus will be as much about mindsets as it is about medicine. \n The psychological aspect came to the fore over the weekend, as many people in Singapore, young and old, stripped supermarket shelves of essentials like noodles, rice and even toilet paper, in a frenzy of stockpiling. This was despite assurances from government leaders and retailers that there are stocks aplenty in warehouses. \n Singapore is a small, close-knit society, and prone to the herd mentality and mass behaviour. \n Social psychology tells us that in times of anxiety, people tend to conform and follow what others are doing. ("My neighbours are stocking up on food; they know something I don\'t, so I am going to do the same.") \n They also start to worry for themselves and their loved ones. ("Everyone else is stocking up; there won\'t be any left for me and my family; I am going out to grab my share.") \n The best way to stop such thinking is to be rational. ("How many packs of rice do I need? Are rice imports going to stop? Will there be rice stocks next week?") \n And then be deliberately pro-social and think of others. ("Do I really need all these alcohol swabs now? What if I buy the last pack of swabs and deprive a sick person who needs it for his daily injection?") \n Individual actions have collective impact. We are all in this virus outbreak together, and we stand or fall together. \n Right now, most of us still go about our daily lives sans mask, gloves or protective clothing, albeit with more attention to hand washing with soap and water, using hand sanitiser and avoiding touching our faces - infection control tips 101. \n But the mood can shift quickly, and we can become a city ruled by fear of strangers and public spaces. \n For example, about 30,000 workers from China have yet to return to Singapore from their Chinese New Year leave\n. There is a risk of infections going up when they return. \n As concerns about community spread widen, more people can be expected to take precautions to protect their loved ones and themselves, by donning protective gear or avoiding crowded spaces. \n With Sars, once the virus spread, people started fearing being around others, not knowing who might be infected. \n They then reacted by shunning those at risk. Many also stayed home, away from shops and eateries, causing businesses to suffer. It took concerted action to shift Singaporeans\' mindsets. \n The Sars experience reminds us that the battle against the virus is fought on two fronts: medical and psychological. \n The medical battle has to do with screening, public hygiene, infection control, diagnosis, treatment of patients, and the race to develop quicker diagnostic tools, better treatment protocols or a vaccine. \n The psychological war is about overcoming fear, prejudice and paranoia. \n From Sars, we know there are three fronts in the psychological battle. \n We must guard against ostracising healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the virus. \n As the virus spreads widely, more people will be infected and need care. This means healthcare workers will be at greater risk. \n During Sars, some Singaporeans reacted by shunning them. This is already happening again. Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam noted in a Facebook post on Friday that he had heard anecdotally about cases of abuse directed at healthcare workers. \n Nurses have taken to Facebook to share anecdotes of how they were ostracised on the MRT and scolded for wearing their uniforms onto the train as fellow travellers feared they were spreading germs. \n This prompted commenters to express support for the nurses, with one post saying: "If you think the nurses and doctors carry lots of germs or if you think that we are dirty, please get your family to nurse you when you are hospitalised\n." \n A young nurse I featured in the Sars book described how, after working hard all day to treat patients at "Sars central" in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), she would find herself shunned on the MRT because of her nurse\'s uniform; neighbours refused to share a lift with her, or shut their windows as she walked past their flats. \n She said with a frown: "It made me really angry. Here we were, trying our best to fight for our patients. If we were not there in the Sars wards, who would be there for them?" \n Others complained that buses and cabs, and even pizza delivery staff, refused to call at TTSH stops. \n The issue was made public by ministers, who urged Singaporeans to change their mindsets. \n Within days, people responded. About 500,000 peach ribbons were made and worn by members of the public to support healthcare workers. TTSH received sachets of herbal lozenges for their staff; anonymous donors sent 60 crates of Fuji apples and 1,000 stalks of gerberas. A fund to salute healthcare workers, called The Courage Fund, raised $28.5 million, and fund administrators had to ask the public to stop giving to it. \n The change motivated healthcare workers and created a more positive atmosphere nationwide. \n This time round, I hope Singaporeans will avoid the shunning and abusive stage and go straight to the stage of appreciating our front-line soldiers in the fight against the virus. \n Of those who died during Sars, about 40 per cent were healthcare workers. They put their lives on the line to care for those infected. They are heroes. They deserve our support and appreciation, not our fear and discrimination. \n Words, thoughtful acts, practical or heartfelt tokens and social media tributes can all make a difference in rallying our healthcare troops. \n The second front in the psychological war is in business. \n As the virus spreads and fear rises, the temptation to hunker down and stay home will prove irresistible. But this will affect businesses badly\n. A shutdown will only harm our own society. \n During Sars, Singaporeans went into panic lockdown mode for a few weeks. The mood seemed darkest in late March and early April, four weeks into the outbreak. \n In April came news that the virus had spread to the Singapore General Hospital, and then beyond hospitals, to a wholesale market. \n But the mood suddenly shifted in the second half of April, and people started coming out to shop. \n Clothing retailer Zara\'s opening on April 23 at Liat Towers attracted hundreds. Best Denki\'s $99 offer of a bar fridge at its new Bishan Junction 8 outlet drew a queue of 200 by opening time. Concerts went ahead. Pubs and nightspots reported a surge in business. \n "It was almost as though the Sars-induced fear had a life of its own - its own incubation period, and its own life cycle. It was as though, after being cooped up for weeks, Singaporeans decided enough was enough and ventured out," I wrote in the book. \n What shifted the mood were deliberate campaigns to boost consumer confidence, bolstered by savvy sales promotions (like the $99 fridge). \n One important initiative was the Cool Singapore programme to provide a Sars-free corridor for tourists and shoppers by ensuring that places like the airport, taxis, hotels, shopping malls and restaurants were Sars-free. \n This was done by introducing regular temperature checks and screening measures at these places. Establishments that met criteria for such screening were audited and certified fever-free to assure shoppers. \n The programme was effective, as no case of Sars surfaced at these establishments, since staff with fever were quickly identified and isolated. It also sent a message to the world that Singapore had Sars under control. \n If Sars was any guide, people will hunker down first, then bounce back to business as usual if they feel safe and if deals are attractive enough\n. Reassurances of safety should thus be matched by concrete action like a programme to audit and certify retail joints. \n The third front in the psychological battle against the virus lies in our own hearts and mindsets. \n It is too easy to blame the victim and lash out with anti-China or anti-Chinese sentiments, as is happening worldwide. In the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, Denmark and a host of other countries, some people and media reports are targeting people from China, people who are ethnic Chinese or people who look East Asian for abuse because of the virus. \n In Singapore, where the majority population is ethnic Chinese, we must not succumb to such racism or xenophobia. We must remember that foreigners are not the culprits; indeed, about one-third of our healthcare workforce, who are risking their lives to fight the virus, are foreign. \n China, meanwhile, is putting up a valiant fight to contain the virus, after an initial state of denial. As many have noted, locking down Wuhan and its surrounds to contain the virus was tantamount to sacrificing a province to save the rest of China and the world. \n After interviewing scores of people for the Sars book, including patients, nurses, doctors, hospital chiefs, civil servants and government ministers, I came away convinced that the much-criticised Singapore nanny state is impressive in action. \n Government authorities nagged about hygiene, cajoled shoppers onto the streets, and enforced quarantine orders. \n The state and its apparatus of community organisations, unions, business groups, religious groups, media organisations and grassroots bodies worked together to trace contacts and deliver timely information, thermometers and food to the quarantined and consolation to the isolated. \n Each night, a press conference helmed by ministers debunked rumours, keeping the information flow open and smooth\n. \n Today, 17 years later, the Singapore Government should be better prepared than in 2003 to lead the fight against the new coronavirus. Meanwhile, our healthcare workers are highly trained and brave. \n It remains for us, as individuals, to realise that what we each do makes a huge collective difference. \n Take responsibility for personal hygiene. Wash hands. Avoid touching your face. Observe leave of absence and quarantine rules. Mask up if unwell and seek medical attention. \n Act responsibly and avoid panic behaviour like stockpiling food, masks or protective equipment. Doing so increases the chance of shortages for people who genuinely need the items. \n Do not shun or shame but be kind to all, including the infected, the quarantined, healthcare workers and those from China. \n Most of all, do not give in to paranoia or fear. Keep calm and carry on. Because we are in it together.\n'
'888888,1,LONDON/BEIJING - HIV patients in China risk running out of life-saving AIDS drugs because quarantines and lockdowns aimed at containing the coronavirus disease outbreak mean they cannot replenish vital medicine stocks, United Nations AIDS agency said on Wednesday.  \n UNAIDS said it had surveyed more than 1,000 people with HIV in China and found that the outbreak of the coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, is having a "major impact" on their lives.  \n The outbreak so far infected more than 74,000 in China, and killed 2,004 of them. Outside China, five deaths and 827 cases have been reported so far.  \n Nearly a third of the HIV positive people surveyed by UNAIDS said lockdowns and restrictions on movement in China meant they were at risk of running out of their HIV treatment in the coming days.  \n Of these, almost half - or 48.6% - said they did not know where to collect their next antiretroviral therapy refill from.  \n "People living with HIV must continue to get the HIV medicines they need to keep them alive," UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said in a statement. "We must ensure that everyone who needs HIV treatment gets it, no matter where they are."  \n UNAIDS says that according to Chinese government sources there were an estimated 1.25 million people with HIV in China at the end of 2018.  \n One HIV-positive volunteer AIDS campaigner in China told Reuters he has set up a group chat that includes more than 100 HIV patients, mostly in Hubei province - epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak - where he is helping patients to share limited stocks of medicines between them.  \n Some HIV patients are scared of letting other people know why they are desperate to get out of the cities.  \n "(Patients are) very panicked, very panicked, and in the group chat I have to comfort them constantly," said the campaigner, who did not want to give his name. "For patients, medicine is important, treatment is important. This could be as important as front-line relief supplies."  \n Adding to the problem of potential shortages is an emerging practice of people not infeGcted with HIV appealing to patients with the AIDS-causing virus to share their medicine as potential experimental treatment against the new coronavirus.  \n Although there is no evidence from clinical trials, China’s National Health Commission said the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir could be tried in COVID-19 patients.  \n That triggered a rush for drugs such as Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drugmaker AbbVie\'s off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir.  \n UNAIDS said lockdowns in various cities have also meant that people with HIV who had travelled away from their home towns have not been able to return home and access HIV services, including treatment, from their usual providers.

'888888,0,SINGAPORE - Singapore\'s\xa0central bank said on Wednesday (Feb 5) that its current exchange-rate band has enough room to accommodate an easing of the local\xa0currency, even as monetary policy stance remains unchanged. \n The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) was responding to media queries about its monetary\xa0policy stance, given that traders are betting that central banks will loosen the policy to support the economy due to the coronavirus outbreak. \n The Bank of Thailand cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low on Wednesday as the coronavirus spread, which\xa0originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, put even more pressure on the struggling economy.\xa0 \n The Singapore dollar slid to a four-month low after the MAS statement on Wednesday, trading down 0.7 per cent to 1.3812 to the US dollar as of 1:30pm from Tuesday’s close. It earlier fell as much as 1 per cent to 1.3853. \n The MAS said that the Singdollar has been fluctuating near the upper bound of the policy band since its last review in\xa0October, when it reduced slightly the Singdollar appreciation rate, the first easing since April 2016. \n “There is therefore sufficient room in the band... to ease in line with any weakness in the Singapore economy in the coming months,” the MAS said. \n A weaker currency, corresponding to policy easing, makes imports more expensive in Singdollar terms, while making Singapore exports more competitive. \n The Singdollar is weighed against a basket of currencies, and it is allowed to fluctuate within an unspecified band, unlike most central banks that use interest rates to manage\xa0their currencies. The MAS regulates the Singdollar by buying or selling the currency when it goes out of the band.\xa0 \n The MAS added that it is “monitoring economic developments closely” and that the next half-yearly monetary policy review “remains as scheduled” in April this year\n. \n DBS Bank foreign exchange strategist Philip Wee said: “The MAS statement tells us that there will be no urgency for an inter-meeting easing in the Singdollar policy before the next scheduled policy review.” \n He notes that the appreciation of the Singdollar “has held in the stronger half of the policy band throughout the United States-China trade war”. \n “Singapore averted a technical recession because the impact from the trade war was not broad-based and confined mostly to trade and manufacturing,” he added. \n “Given the potential negative spillover from the coronavirus into domestic demand and services... it is not unreasonable for the (Singapore) currency to reposition at a more neutral level, currently just below the mid-point of the policy band,” said Mr Wee. \n He predicts that a further deterioration in the coronavirus outbreak would keep the Singdollar in the lower half of the band - between $1.376 to $1.403 against the US dollar.\xa0 \n The bank is keeping to its Singdollar forecast of $1.40 against the greenback by March. \n Maybank foreign exchange research head Saktiandi Supaat said: “The severity of the outbreak and its impact on the local economy, especially the tourism industry and sectors such as manufacturing tied to Chinese demand, will likely come into policy consideration (for the upcoming review).” \n He noted that potential measures targeted at the tourism and consumer sectors, as announced by the Government might also help allay market concerns. \n He added: “But our baseline view is still that the outbreak would be contained at some point,” he added.\xa0 \n CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said that the virus outbreak has made it clear that Singapore is in for a tough first quarter, but the economic forecast remains unchanged so far. \n “We are not in that period of great uncertainty yet,” he said, adding that economic indicators such as growth and inflation have not began flashing warning signs\n.\xa0 \n Correction: The headline of an earlier version of the article said there is "sufficient room" for monetary policy to ease. That is incorrect.\xa0 It should be "sufficient room" for the Singapore dollar to ease within MAS\' current policy band. We are sorry for the error.\n'

'888888,0,BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - As Argentina was scrambling to introduce emergency measures to insulate its ailing economy from the coronavirus last week, the Chinese ambassador paid a visit to the home of President Alberto Fernandez to discuss an offer.\nAt the meeting in the wealthy Olivos suburb of Buenos Aires, ambassador Zou Xiaoli laid out how the Asian giant was ready to help Argentina face the pandemic: donating masks, gloves, thermometers and protective suits.\nThe donations, welcomed by Fernandez’s government, show how China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is jostling for influence against the United States.\nFrom Argentina to Mexico, Brazil to Peru, Latin American nations have accepted offers of support from China as the number of coronavirus cases across the region has climbed, amid growing fears about the preparedness of their healthcare systems.\nThere have been nearly 500,000 confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, and over 20,000 deaths.\nAlthough South America has so far not been as hard hit as other parts of the world, experts fear that may change as winter arrives in the southern hemisphere.\n“Some countries in the region have reached out to China asking for help,” a Chinese official in Buenos Aires, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. “We will share with them our experience in combating COVID-19 and offer sanitary materials within our capacity.”\nAs trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have simmered in recent years, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Latin American nations that they should be wary of becoming too economically reliant on China - to little avail.\nIn Argentina, the region’s third-largest economy, China has made steady in-roads, from solar power investments to the construction of a new space monitoring station. It has supplied over $17 billion of financing since 2007, Inter-American Dialogue data shows. China has also become the top consumer of Argentine soybeans and beef.\nAs the coronavirus spread in China, Argentina’s new left-leaning leader Fernandez - who took office in December - exchanged correspondence with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nIn letters seen by Reuters, Fernandez offered solidarity to China in February as the virus raged from the outbreak center of Wuhan. In March, Xi replied that the situation in China was improving and he called for a deepening of ties between the two nations.\nDays later, the Chinese embassy announced its donations, posting pictures on Twitter of large trucks carrying a mobile hospital that was set up within a military base near the Argentine capital.\n“China will continue to help in all possible channels. Long live friendship!” the embassy said on Twitter.\nThe help came at a difficult time for Argentina, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis and re-negotiating $110 billion in foreign debt with creditors, including the International Monetary Fund.\n“This is part of the link we have with China, which is a solid relationship of mutual respect and ties that go beyond strong trade,” a spokesman for Argentina’s foreign ministry told Reuters, when asked about the donations.\nChina’s aid to Latin America reflects a broader global trend, as Beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. Instead, China wants to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic, experts say.\nLuo Zhaohui, a vice minister at China’s foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that the country would “ride out the storm with people from other countries, strengthen cooperation and strive to win the last victory in the fight against the virus.”\nWhile Trump has been criticized by opponents for branding the pandemic ‘the Chinese virus,’ China has won praise among Latin American governments that have accepted its help. The Chinese government said it has supplied test kits, protective suits and other forms of medical aid to more than 80 countries and international organizations.\n“It’s remarkable and a credit, in a way, to China’s own commanding control of information that it’s been able to re-envision itself as a leader in the fight against coronavirus globally,” said Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue.\nMyers said the recent re-start of Chinese industry, as cases have subsided, has enabled the country to be a provider of key products as the rest of the world’s production slows.\n“This will create opportunities for China in the coming years,” she said.\nThe United States, meanwhile, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus, with the World Health Organization warning on Tuesday that the country could become a new epicenter of the crisis.\nBefore the epidemic hit hardest, Washington in February pledged $100 million towards international efforts in combating COVID-19, including for developing nations. A regional breakdown of that funding was not immediately available.\nIn Latin America, China’s hands-on approach has been well received.\nChile, which has among the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the region, has sought advice from Chinese health officials to guide its response and is sending an air force plane to China to pick up donated supplies, including tests and respiratory equipment, Chile’s health minister said.\nIn Mexico, officials have said they are awaiting 300 ventilators from China, crucial yet scarce equipment in treating patients, while in Panama, government health officials heralded a video conference with Chinese experts to work on strategy, something China has done with more than 100 countries.\nIn Venezuela, the government of President Nicolas Maduro said China would send protective gear for health professionals and coronavirus test kits. The country has also opened talks with China over possible financial support.\n“Thank you China for cooperation and solidarity with Ecuador!” the country’s Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner wrote on Twitter, itemizing help from China that he said included 40,000 surgical masks, infrared thermometers, and protective suits.\nIn Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has moved quickly to heal a diplomatic rift with China and Chinese officials have said Beijing would assist with medical supplies and technical assistance.\nChinese firms, including Alibaba (BABA.N), Huawei, COFCO, China Communications Construction and the Bank of China have pledged donations around the region.\nBack in Argentina, Washington is keen to show that it also wants to help.\n“We plan this week to make funds available to Argentine authorities to combat coronavirus,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires told Reuters, adding the country was “looking at the possibility of additional donations.”\n'

'888888,0,WINNIPEG, Manitoba - Canada will not allow anyone displaying symptoms of the COVID-19 respiratory illness to board domestic flights or inter-city passenger trains, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday, the latest travel restriction aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak.  \n Trudeau\'s government has long urged Canadians feeling ill to stay at home, but he told reporters at his daily press conference outside his residence that Transport Canada had now formalized travel rules as COVID-19 cases steadily rise.  \n Trudeau had been in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the virus. In a statement on Saturday, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said she had "received the all clear from my physician and Ottawa Public Health."  \n Canada\'s domestic travel restrictions will take effect on Monday at noon EDT.  \n Asked how screening would be different, Trudeau said the government was giving new tools to airlines and railways. Transport Canada later said airline and rail company staff would ask health questions of passengers and look for visible symptoms.  \n Even enhanced screening offers "no guarantee" that sick people will not board, as they can hide symptoms, Howard Njoo, Canada\'s deputy chief public health officer, said in a separate press conference.  \n Canada has confirmed 5,153 cases of coronavirus, and 55 deaths, health officials said. While case numbers are climbing, the rate of growth in British Columbia, the Pacific Coast province where community transmission was first reported, seems to be slowing, Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said.  \n "There are signs of hope," she told reporters in Ottawa.  \n In the province of Quebec, however, the number of cases jumped by 24% in the past day to nearly 2,500, more than double any other province. Four additional deaths raised Quebec\'s death toll to 22.  \n New police checkpoints were set to begin restricting non-essential traffic to eight Quebec regions on Saturday, Quebec Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault.  \n Ontario banned public events and gatherings of more than five people on Saturday.  \n Air Canada, the country\'s biggest airline, said it would operate a special flight returning Canadians from Algeria on Tuesday, with additional flights scheduled from Peru and Ecuador.  \n China\'s embassy in Ottawa tweeted that the Bank of China had on Friday donated medical supplies to Canada, including thousands of masks, goggles and gloves.  \n Trudeau has faced criticism at home for sending a shipment of protective equipment to China in February, before COVID-19 cases spiked in Canada.

'888888,0,LONDON - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:  \n  \n * Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.  \n * Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.  \n * COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.  \n * A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.  \n * They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.  \n * Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.  \n * The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was "too early" to speak of a pandemic.  \n * Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.  \n * Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with "crown"-like spikes.  \n * Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.  \n * Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a "recombinant" virus strain.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON — The United States now has more Covid-19 infections than any other country, and a record number of newly unemployed people, as the coronavirus crisis deepens around the world. \n Hours after his nation\xa0reached the grim milestone, US President Donald Trump spoke by phone to China\'s Xi Jinping, after weeks of bickering and finger pointing over a disease researchers say could kill at least 1.8 million people by the end of the year. \n "Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China," Mr Trump tweeted. \n "China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!" \n The warm words\xa0— which were not quite echoed in the Chinese state media readout of the call\xa0— came after a few weeks in which the White House had repeatedly referred to "the Chinese coronavirus", angering Beijing. \n China, which appears to have got on top of its own outbreak, readied to bar entry to foreigners as it frets over a surge in imported cases, illustrating the difficulty of containing a virus in an interconnected world. \n Wuhan, the city where the illness first emerged late last year, was\xa0— from midnight\xa0— to ease severe movement restrictions in place for two months. \n That initial lockdown has now been aped around the world, with three billion people told to stay indoors. \n Healthcare systems in even the most developed nations are being stretched to breaking point with dire warnings they could soon be overwhelmed. \n More than 530,000 people globally have been sickened by the disease. \n A tally by Johns Hopkins University showed that by around 5pm SGT Friday (March 27), there were almost 86,000 known infections in the US. That figure is higher than both China and hard-hit Italy, which accounts for a third of the 24,000 deaths worldwide. \n GRIM PREDICTIONS \n Even with lockdowns implemented around the world, researchers at Imperial College London said Thursday the global death toll could be staggering. \n Their model shows 1.86 million people could die, with nearly 470 million infected this year.\xa0 \n Failure to act swiftly in imposing lockdowns and strict social distancing could make those numbers far higher, they warned. \n "Our analysis highlights the challenging decisions faced by all governments in the coming weeks and months, but demonstrates the extent to which rapid, decisive and collective action now could save millions of lives," the researchers said. \n As fears mount over a global recession that could even dwarf the Great Depression of the 1930s, leaders from the Group of 20 major economies\xa0held crisis talks by video link on Thursday. \n They pledged a "united front" to fight the outbreak\xa0— along with an enormous financial rescue package. \n "The virus respects no borders," the leaders said in a statement. \n "We are injecting over US$5 trillion (S$7.17 trillion) into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic." \n They also pledged "robust" support for developing nations, where experts fear the coronavirus could wreak havoc. \n PAINFUL CHOICES \n Medical systems in even the most developed nations are straining under the weight of new patients. \n In New York, where tens of thousands are ill, Governor Andrew Cuomo warned there were simply not enough hospital beds. \n "Almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current healthcare system," he said. \n For those fighting on the frontlines, the pressure was showing. \n "To watch somebody in their thirties die, it\'s hard," said one respiratory therapist in the city who requested anonymity. "You can\'t have visitors. They\'re in the room by themselves on a ventilator. It\'s very depressing." \n In Europe, medics were already having to make choices. \n "If I\'ve got five patients and only one bed, I have to choose who gets it," Dr Sara Chinchilla, a pediatrician at a hospital near Madrid, told AFP. \n "People are dying who could be saved but there\'s no space in intensive care." \n ECONOMIC DEVASTATION \n The pandemic has already become catastrophic for the global economy. \n In the United States, the world\'s largest economy, the Labor Department reported that 3.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week\xa0— by far the highest number ever recorded. \n Job losses have swept across sectors from food services to retail to transportation, as nearly half of the country has closed non-essential businesses. \n "It is staggering. We are only seeing the initial numbers; they will get worse, unfortunately," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work. \n Stock markets remained volatile, with Asian bourses in the green Friday after a third straight day of rises on Wall Street, while Europe started the day down. \n Traders have taken heart from the passage through the Senate of a $2 trillion stimulus bill\xa0— the largest in US history, which will support American businesses and provide cash payouts averaging US$3,400 for a family of four. \n The bill goes before the\xa0House of Representatives on Friday.

'888888,0,SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said it will take down misinformation about China’s fast-spreading coronavirus, in a rare departure from its usual approach to dubious health content that is presenting a fresh challenge for social media companies.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe. Hoaxes have spread widely online, promoted by conspiracy theorists and exacerbated by a dearth of information from the cordoned-off zone around China’s central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began.\nNearly 12,000 people have been infected in China, according to local health authorities, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions.\nFacebook said in a blog post that it would remove content about the virus “with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,” saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to “physical harm.”\nThe move is unusually aggressive for the world’s biggest social network, which generally limits the distribution of content containing health misinformation to its 2.9 billion monthly users through restrictions on search results and advertising, but allows the original posts to stay up.\nIt also puts it at odds with other major U.S.-based social networks. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users and Twitter (TWTR.N) and Reddit, which have hundreds of millions of users, confirmed they do not consider inaccurate information about health to be a violation of their policies.\nThose companies, like Facebook in other cases, rely on techniques such as elevating medical information from authoritative public health sources and warning users about content that has been debunked.\nTikTok, owned by China’s Bytedance, and Pinterest Inc (PINS\n.N) do ban health misinformation and are actively removing false coronavirus content, they told Reuters.\nFact-checking initiative PolitiFact said misinformation about the virus online included hoaxes about its source, its spread, and how to treat it, as well as false conspiracies about its connection to biological warfare and the Chinese government.\nRumors about the coronavirus have also spread widely on Chinese social networks, which are usually quick to remove sensitive content but have in recent days allowed an unusual level of public criticism over the government’s handling of the crisis.\nInformation in China is tightly controlled, and Chinese laws dictate that rumor-mongers can face years in prison. In the early days of the outbreak, Chinese state media reported that police in Wuhan had detained eight people for spreading rumors about a “local outbreak of unidentifiable pneumonia.”\nSuspicion also lingers over accusations that Beijing initially covered up the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.\nA spokeswoman for Tencent Holdings Inc’s (0700.HK) Chinese messaging app WeChat, which has 1.15 billion monthly users, told Reuters the company was removing posts containing coronavirus-related misinformation.\nThe U.S. tech industry’s mostly hands-off approach has angered critics who say social media companies have failed to curb the spread of medical inaccuracies that pose major global health threats.\nIn particular, misinformation about vaccination has proliferated on social media in many countries in recent years, including during major vaccination campaigns to prevent polio in Pakistan and to immunize against yellow fever in South America.\nFacebook, under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy and content practices, has previously removed vaccine misinformation in Samoa, where a measles outbreak killed dozens late last year\n.\nThe spread of illness there was so severe that the company classified anti-vaccination content a risk of physical harm, a spokeswoman told Reuters, calling the move an “extreme action.”\nThe coronavirus and Samoa decisions indicate Facebook is expanding its definition of “physical harm” to include misinformation contributing to the rapid spread of illness.\nThe company did not say whether it had acted in a similar way in other cases.\nIt removed misinformation about polio vaccines in Pakistan, but the imminent harm in that case involved risks of violence against the health workers carrying out the immunization campaigns, the spokeswoman said.\n'
'888888,0,Amid the rapid spread of coronavirus cases around the globe, researchers have found that diarrhea was a prominent symptom among up to half of patients with Covid-19 during the outbreak in Wuhan, China.\nThe study, published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology, conducted by the researchers from the Wuhan Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19.\nAccording to the researchers, nearly half of Covid-19 patients enrolled in the study conducted in the Hubei province of China presented digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea and anorexia, and cited it as their chief complaint.\n"Doctors should recognise that digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea, may be a presenting feature of Covid-19, and that the index of suspicion may need to be raised earlier in at-risk patients presenting with digestive symptoms rather than waiting for respiratory symptoms to emerge," the researchers said.\nPatients involved in the study presented to three hospitals from January 18 to February 28. All patients were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for clinical characteristics, laboratory data, and treatment. Data were followed up until March 5.\nOverall, data from 204 patients were analysed for the current study, according to the researchers.\nThe average age was 54.9 years old. In total, 48.5 per cent presented to the hospital with digestive symptoms as their chief complaint.\nThe study also revealed that patients with digestive symptoms had a longer gap between the onset of symptoms and hospital admission than patients presenting only respiratory symptoms and were less likely to be cured and discharged than those without digestive symptoms.\nPatients who experienced digestive symptoms had a variety of manifestations, including anorexia (83.8 per cent), diarrhea (29.3 per cent), vomiting (0.08 per cent), and abdominal pain (0.4 per cent), the study said.\nAccording to the researchers, as the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced.\n'

'888888,1,Experts say the number of people infected with Wuhan virus will exceed 250000 within 14 days, VOA reported.\nAccording to the report, research experts predict that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus in Wuhan will exceed 250000 within 14 days, and the virus will break out in large cities such as beishangguang.\nAfter the outbreak of Wuhan epidemic, the University of Glasgow Centre for virus Research) and four infectious disease biologists from the University of Florida in the United States closely tracked the epidemic situation, and analyzed the epidemic situation and spread using professional models and existing data. On January 23, the Research Report "2019 new coronavirus: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic prediction" was released.\nAccording to the report, the basic reproductive number of new coronavirus (????? 0) is significantly greater than one, currently between 3.6 and 4. This shows that the control rate of virus transmission must be between 72% and 75% in order to stop the increase of virus infection; the report estimates that only 5.1% of new coronavirus infection in Wuhan area has been found at present, and there are a large number of undetected virus infections in urban communities.\n"If there is no change in control or transmission, we expect further outbreaks in other cities in China, and the virus will continue to be exported to overseas regions more rapidly," the report quoted the report as saying. Our model predicts that in the next 14 days (February 4, 2020), Wuhan will have more than 250000 virus infected people. Other cities where we expect the largest outbreaks in China are Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Chengdu. We also expect that by February 4, 2020, the countries or special administrative regions most likely to import virus infection through air travel will be Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. ".\nAccording to the report, the measures taken by Hubei Province to close the city were analyzed, and it was found that these measures were difficult to effectively control the spread of the virus. "Our model shows that travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan are unlikely to effectively stop the spread of the virus across China; by February 4, if travel is effectively reduced by 99%, the scale of the epidemic outside Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9%," the report said\n。\nAccording to the Central News Agency today, more than 40000 people in Wuhan were infected with pneumonia at Hong Kong University Medical College, which declined in the middle of the year.\nAccording to the media report, Liang Zhuowei, Dean of the school of medicine of University of Hong Kong, said today that according to the research model, the current outbreak of the new coronavirus is doubling every 6.2 days. It is estimated that 44 thousand people have been infected in Wuhan. The overall epidemic will be "peaked" in 4 and May, and will gradually decrease in 6 and July.\nAccording to the report of Hongkong radio and Xingdao daily, a press conference was held on the afternoon of May 27 to explain the latest epidemic situation of new-type pneumonia. Liang Zhuowei made the above estimate at the meeting. Liang Zhuowei, Dean of the medical school of the University of Hong Kong, said that as of the first day of the new year (25th), it is estimated that there should be no less than 25000 people diagnosed in Wuhan. In addition, there are still cases in the incubation period and without disease, and it is expected that 44000 people have been infected in Wuhan. The basic reproduction rate of the virus is 2.13, which means that the epidemic will double every 6.2 days.\nAccording to Liang Zhuowei, Wuhan is the main transportation hub in Central China. It is estimated that some of the infected people went to other provinces and cities by means of transportation as early as the first day of the new year. At least 18 cases have entered Qingdao, and at most 318 cases have entered Chongqing. He believes that the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan will continue to rise in the future, and he dare not say that the early customs clearance measures have no effect, but as some cases have been exported to other provinces and cities earlier, the epidemic situation in relevant regions will change greatly, and the confirmed cases will continue to appear in the next few weeks.\nLiang predicted that the epidemic would peak in April and may in Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Among them, Chongqing has the most frequent traffic links with Wuhan, with the largest number of people entering and leaving the country. It will reach the peak one to two weeks earlier than other provinces and cities, and the epidemic will slowly decline in June and July.\nAccording to Liang Zhuowei, Dean of the medical school of the University of Hong Kong, the results will be sent to the World Health Organization (who), China National Center for Disease Control and the Hong Kong SAR government for reference.\n'

'888888,0,Moscow, 21 January. /tass/ The outbreak of a previously unknown coronavirus that appeared in China late last year may have been linked to infection in bats and other wildlife. Georgi bashekin, chief of the molecular evolution section of the information transmission Research Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences, introduced this situation.\nViruses are most like pathogens extracted from bats. It can be cautiously assumed that the transmission of animals to humans was carried out by hand winged mammals or some related intermediate link, Bazekin explained that, like other corona\nThe Chinese authorities (31 December 2019) reported to the World Health Organization (who) that an unknown outbreak of viral pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, central China. On January 7, Chinese experts discovered a disease pathogen, corona virus 2019 ncov.\nThe number of new cases of pneumonia in China has risen to 291, the National Health Commission reported on January 21. Three other Asian countries - Japan, South Korea and Thailand - reported separate 2019 ncov cases. So far, six residents in Wuhan have died of the disease, Chinese media reported\nAbout\n"This time, our Chinese colleagues worked very well and soon got data on the genetic structure of the virus. These sequences are public. The comparison shows that they are very similar to SARS, SARS virus, Issued in the people\'s Republic of China and neighboring countries in 2002. It\'s important to understand that it\'s not the same virus, but it\'s very close to it. "\nNew threats\nAs bathkin points out, the new virus belongs to the same group as the well-known SARS and mers, that is, the pathogen of SARS and Middle East fever. In the past decade, these two viruses have claimed hundreds of lives in the Middle East and East Asia and have repeatedly caused epidemics, Spread through camels and poultry.\nThe pathogen of all three diseases is the so-called coronavirus. Their infection causes similar symptoms: fever, cough, respiratory problems, and persistent phlegm. The incubation period was 12 days, and then the fever started immediately. In general, about half of patients die from malnutrition, complications or related infections.\nWe cannot rule out that the virus is not transmitted to humans through bats, but through other ways.\nAbout On the other hand, there is evidence that it was produced by pigs or other pets, and there is no new virus for the first time in the seafood market. We can only guess how it happened. "\nHe said the data available to scientists do not indicate when a vaccine for the disease will be developed. At the same time, it can stop the spread of viral pneumonia in China. In East Asia, it\'s the lunar new year, which epidemiologists are worried about, During this period, a large number of residents from China and neighboring countries traveled to other cities and countries.\n"According to current very rough estimates, the highest number of infected people is about 1700, while the number of inpatients is much smaller. It can only be said now that the virus can be passed from person to person, and how sustainable its transmission is - it is not clear yet. Transfer to Russia cannot be ruled out in principle. In the era of SARS, we have had one case of infection. "\nAt the same time, basekin said he believed that simple ways to control infection included thermal imagers at airports and other places where people gathered, It helps to control the outbreak of pneumonia and prevent it from becoming a bigger epidemic.\nAbout Scientists hope that China and other countries can avoid taking more stringent measures in response to SARS.\n'

Less sharply, production may also be affected temporarily by holiday extensions and possible measures to contain the virus. The spread of the coronavirus has led companies to limit travel to China, which will affect the hotel, catering and transport,"DBRS says.\nCancelling flights to and from China and limiting travel could lead to a reduction in the consumption of petroleum products as a whole and thus lower the price of crude oil.

All of these patients received the same treatment and care, which enabled us to understand the impact of cardiovascular disease on the development of covid-19.\nThese observations suggest that carriers of these problems have a higher virus infection rate than other patients. In particular, they have had symptoms of the disease before, ten times more than the most extreme form of pneumonia. Although these problems affect about 5% of other patients.\nOverall, these differences lead to an average of 4.5 times more deaths from coronavirus infection in patients with chronic heart and vascular disease. Compared with other viral vectors. Overall, about half of the first patients died of infection, while only 4% of the others died of the new coronavirus（\nWhy? Scientists can't say for the momenAbout However, they believe that the virus can interact directly with cardiac muscle cells because there is an ACE2 receptor on its surface.

The second suspicious case, which had been referred to the University Hospital Centre of San Juan in Porto, it also had a negative result, informed the DGS already this Tuesday, a few minutes after midnight.\nCases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in more than twenty countries. Even if the vast majority of cases are limited to China, there is still concern that they may spread further around the world. In order to assess the risk of importing cases to other countries, a team from the Humboldt University of Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute, both in Germany, used a computational model, considering the distribution of confirmed cases in China and the 4000 airport air transport network and more than 50.000 air routes. Airport closures due to the epidemic have already been included in the model.\nIt was concluded that Thailand (in addition to China) is the country most likely to have people arriving from one of the airports analysed with coronavirus. This list follows Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Cambodia. The first European country on this list is Germany, which is in 18th placeYeah. Although Angola is on the list of 13 African countries with top priority for the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the fight against the new coronavirus, it does not include the top-10 of African countries with the highest risk of importation in this model. This top is headed by Ethiopia, followed by Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritius, Reunion, Nigeria and Tunisia. Overall, according to the model, Angola is in 115th place.\n"Portugal has a very low risk of import," says Public Dirk Brockmann of Humboldt University. "It is in 61.th position with a relative import risk of 0,01%, which is about 20 times smaller than the risk of Germany." Nevertheless, while Germany has a risk of 0,2%, Thailand has 2,2%. Dirk Brockmann points out that the purpose of this model is to give an overview of the current situation and be a risk analysis tool that can be used by policy makers and public health authorities. In addition to providing country-specific alerts, the model provides data for specific airports.\nAlthough we\'ve given so much to talk about, we still don\'t know enough about the new coronavirus. Efforts have not been lacking and scientists around the world have been paying attention to the virus. Among the latest news is the publication of the complete biomolecular code of the virus.\nSamples of the new coronavirus have been processed in laboratories around the world and raw information about the genetic code has been sent to the repository of the United States National Health Institutions. From there, a team from the University of California in Santa Cruz (USA) collected information from 29.903 nucleotides, adenine, timine, cytosine and guanine, the basic chemical elements that make up the DNA molecule, represented by letters A, T, C and G, and made it available in the public database Genome Browser BrowserYeah.\n"By providing data on coronavirus in the Browser Genome at the University of California in Santa Cruz, this allows investigators to observe the structure of the virus and, more importantly, investigate how they can attack it," stated Hiram Clawson, a researcher at that university.\nThe way this coronavirus is transmitted has been another major issue. CoronVirus is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected secretions and aerosols in therapeutic procedures that produce them, DGS states. But how long does it persist on surfaces and how can it be inactivated? Two professors from the Greifswald University Hospital in Germany tried to answer these questions.\nTo find answers, they analyzed studies on coronavirus SARS and MERS. It was found that these viruses could persist on surfaces and remain infectious at room temperature on average between four and five days. "Low temperatures and high humidity in the air further increase your life span", says Gunter Kampf in a statement from his institution.\nAs for the inactivation of the various coronaviruses in tests with disinfectant solutions, agents with ethanol, commonly oxygenated water or sodium hypochlorite were found to be effective against coronavirus. If these agents were applied at appropriate concentrations, they would reduce the pathogenic particles from one million to 100 in about one minute. For researchers, these results may be extrapolated to the new coronavirus. "We analyzed different coronavirus and the results were similar", says Eike Steinmann.\nThis Tuesday and Wednesday, scientists, public health agency professionals, health ministers and research backers will be meeting in Geneva (Switzerland) to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and coronavirus vaccineYeah. In this meeting organized by the WHO in conjunction with the Global Research Collaboration for the Preparation of Infectious Diseases, we will discuss the origin of the virus, identify knowledge gaps or medical products that should be necessary to minimise the impact of the epidemic. "The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus," says the WHO in communication.\nAn international mission led by the WHO also arrived in China this Monday to investigate the epidemic. Epidemiologists on this mission are trying to better understand how the transmission between people takes place, how the virus spreads in hospitals or why some people are dying.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThis Monday was also marked by the visit of the President of China, Xi Jinping, to various sites in Beijing, notably a community centre, a hospital or disease control centre. Xi Jinping was always seen with a mask and his temperature was measured. At Ditan Hospital, where coronavirus-infected patients are being treated, Xi Jinping even took part in a video conference with health professionals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, which the Chinese President has not yet visited.\nThis is considered a rare public appearance of Xi Jinping during the epidemic and occurred days after the death of doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to warn colleagues about the virus and ended up being punished for spreading rumors. The visit also took place on the day when many Chinese return to work after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year vacation. Therefore, the WHO has already stressed that the number of cases outside China may be just "the tip of an iceberg"'

'888888,1,A black swan wanders through Asia and its global impact has yet to be determined. Wuhan coronavirus is a textbook example of unexpected event that affects the health and the economy. Protein consumption in emerging countries has soared as the economy and living standards have risen. Interaction between virus also animal and human diseases. known risks, but unfortunately increasingly common. which it can be curbed, but there is also a risk of it becoming a global pandemic. Previous experience was more like that of the Sars virus in 2002-2003. They have since improved prevention mechanisms and response to health alerts across Asia. In countries like South Korea, I have seen personally a few days, although the incidence is almost nil, public messaging networks and sanitary measures are considerable ago.\nWhat is now handled is an important uncertainty already has a significant negative economic impact. To date, the consequences of these events have not spread beyond a few months. Not a big relief, in any case, because if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic, the effects can be serious in a moment of true decay. The strength of a weak global economy in 2020 goes through the evolution of the Chinese economy and the coronavirus does not help. The first reflections and appreciated. They have come for the price of crude. The fall in demand among other issues by lower industrial activity and land and air traffic in China reduced the price of a barrel Brent 6% only last week.\nValue indices and stock market volatility have not yet reacted to these fears appreciably. But in the forums market analysis the risk of contagion is in every mouth. If this and other dangers such as geopolitical tensions with Iran are not reflected more in the markets it is because they are more aware of the central banks. Lax monetary policy seems to have undermined the ability to emit warning signals.\nIf you get to a pandemic, experience dictates that could be affected values \u200b\u200bemerging companies, with falls of up to 20%. SARS life took 800 people and had an estimated cost of $ 50,000 million. Already more than 40 million Chinese citizens isolated but some analysts fear that this circle of protection has been late. It has rekindled the debate in the medical community about whether the massive use of antibiotics in farm animals is having a negative effect on immunity levels in humans. In favor of avoiding pandemic plays extension improved prevention mechanisms. In contrast, this virus takes five days to express their symptoms and no hypothesis about its origin, but not yet official confirmation.'

'888888,0,As coronavirus infections spike across South-east Asia, Myanmar and Laos have conspicuously logged zero patients - despite the fact that both share a sizeable border with China, where the out-break originated. \n Both countries say all the people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have tested negative so far. But limited access to testing equipment and reagents means that they have conducted only about 300 tests for a combined population of 60 million. \n The official explanation has not assuaged public concern in Myanmar, where at least four patients with symptoms indicative of Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, have died in quarantine. Some panic buying of necessities has occurred in Yangon and Mandalay. \n Both Laos and Myanmar have locked down their land borders, closed schools and put hospitals on standby. \n "We know that our country could have Covid-19 any time," Dr Khin Khin Gyi, spokesman for Myanmar\'s Health Ministry, told The Straits Times. "We have checked the people who came though the airports. We have checked the people who came through the border points... We have not found it so far, but we are preparing for it." \n In Laos, Dr Reiko Tsuyuoka, the World Health Organisation\'s (WHO) health emergencies programme lead in the country, said: "If and when Covid-19 arrives in Lao PDR, I expect we will know about it quickly." Laos is officially known as the Lao People\'s Democratic Republic. \n With the help of the WHO and partners, Laos\' Health Ministry has developed "a strong system for detecting and responding to health threats", she told ST. "It has good laboratories and a network of well-trained outbreak epidemiologists spread across the country." \n Laos has tested nearly 100 people for Covid-19. "The health authorities here are taking a targeted approach to testing as the country\'s stock of testing reagents is quite limited at this time," Dr Tsuyuoka said. \n The WHO is helping Laos to stockpile protective equipment for health workers, buy additional ventilators and new laboratory equipment, as well as roll out a public awareness campaign. \n Laos has also closed all schools and entertainment venues, as well as designated a 14-day quarantine area for arrivals from high-risk countries, including Laotians returning home for the New Year festival next month, according to the Vientiane Times. The country has also revoked visa exemptions. \n In Myanmar, 175 suspected Covid-19 cases are under investigation as of Thursday night, according to the Myanmar Health Ministry website. Tests on 157 people have turned out negative, and results for another 18 are pending. \n Dr Khin Khin Gyi stressed Myanmar has no confirmation that any deaths were caused by Covid-19. \n She said the ministry is working with civil society and companies to disseminate information quickly, and has also instructed hospitals to designate rooms for patients who might be infected. In Yangon, eight hospitals have already made such preparations. Laboratory testing of samples takes place around the clock, she added. \n The United Nations Children\'s Fund, in a report on Myanmar released on Thursday, said "the government acknowledged challenges in screening and response capacity in non-government-controlled areas which share a porous border with China". \n '

The patient is stable and is being closely monitored."\nThe 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic that has concerned health experts worldover started in China\'s Wuhan city early December last year and has claimed more than 170 lives.\nKerala Health Minister KK Shailaja said 20 samples were sent for tests out of which one was found to be positive for novel coronavirus.\n"The patient had returned from Wuhan in China and is now kept in isolation at General Hospital in Thrissur. She is stable," the minister said, adding that the state government has already set up a control room.\n"We have directed all hospitals, including private ones, to monitor patients coming with similar symptoms (of coronavirus). The health department is all set to isolate patients and start treatment," Shailaja said.\nMeanwhile, responding to the developments, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said, "It is an unfortunate turn of events. One case is positive and we have one more test to do. We are taking adequate measures. We have dealt with an outbreak like this before. We have to take precautionary measures because it spreads from person to person."\nIn Kerala, one person each from Thrissur, Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta and Malappuram and three from Ernakulam district have been kept in isolation wards of various helath centres, news agency PTI reported.\nAs a precautionary measure, health authorities in India have placed many people under medical watch. Various airports in the country have started screening passengers arriving from China for symptoms of coronavirus infection\n.\nNews agency Reuters reported that a senior Indian government official said bringing Indian nationals from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus, was not the best option due to the risk of infection but increased pressure from the citizens, most of them students, and their parents had forced them to keep an aircraft on standby.\nThis week, India readied a state-carrier airplane to travel to Wuhan but was waiting for a nod from Chinese authorities who were trying to sequence the whole evacuation process.\n"Only those nationals who don\'t have the virus will be airlifted, they will be brought into a quarantine facility outside Delhi," the official said, requesting anonymity.\nDemands from South Asian nationals intensified after countries such as the United States and Japan began pulling out their nationals.\nWHAT IS 2019-NOVEL CORONAVIRUS?\nThe 2019-novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV is a new strain of cornoviruses and has not been previously seen in humans. Cornoviruses form a large family of viruses and the illness they cause can range from common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\nThese viruses are zoonotic, which means they are transmitted from animals to humans.\nWhile the exact source (i.e. the animal from which it started) of 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified, other strains of coronoviruses have previously been seen to be transmitted from civet cats to humans (in the case of SARS-CoV) and from dromedary camels to humans (in the case of MERS-CoV).\nThese aren\'t the only form of coronaviruses. There are many that circulate among animals but have not yet infected humans.\nWHAT CAN 2019-nCoV DO?\nSince this is the first time 2019-nCoV is reported to have infected humans, there is limited information on the exact range of illness the virus can cause. Its effects can range from cough and fever to kidney failure and even death\n.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed the following common signs observed in people infected by 2019-novel coronavirus:\nPRECAUTIONS YOU MUST TAKE\nMuch remains to be known about how exactly the 2019-nCoV infection transmits between humans and animals, and the extent of human-to-human transmissions.\nThe WHO has issued an advisory to reduce risk among those travelling from or to the affected regions.\nAs per WHO, you should observe the following precautions:\n(With inputs from agencies.)\n'
'888888,0,For the first time since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, a person outside China has died as a result of a new respiratory disease. Like the\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Sunday that\nPhilippines is a Chinese from Wuhan, where the Coronavirus first appeared in humans in December. Since then, it has spread to nearly thirty countries.\n"This is the first reported\nDeath outside China,"said WHO representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe in\nManila! He added, however, that it should be borne in mind that the man did not\nthe Philippines.\nThe deceased is a 44-year-old male on 25th. In January, the Philippine Ministry of Health announced that he had arrived at the hospital with fever, cough and sore throat. Later, the man was suffering from pneumonia. However, he was in stable condition and signs of recovery\nIt went on. Surprisingly, the\nhis condition in the last 24 hours then again\nHe died in a hospital in Manila.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected\nYeah.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than sars and also the virus flu\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nLike the Philippine\nHealth Minister Francisco Duque said the man had traveled to the country alongside a Chinese woman who had also tested positive for the virus. The woman rests\ncurrently in hospital from the infection.\nShortly before the death, the Philippine government had closed the country\'s border to all foreign immigrants from China. Other countries, including Australia and the USA, have imposed similar entry bans.\nIn the People\'s Republic, the number of infected and fatalities is increasing despite massive security measures. After\nAuthorities have so far reported that 304 patients have died from the virus in China. More than 14.300 people have been infected in the country. Nine cases are known in Germany. Spain also reported that a German tourist was infected by the Coronavirus\nYeah. A passenger on board a German military machine with which more than 100 Germans had returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Saturday is suspected of carrying the virus.\nWuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, is considered to be the center of the expansion and is under quarantine. It is currently believed that the virus of wild animals was transmitted to humans in a market. Because of the rapid spread of the virus, for the first time a city outside the province of Hubei has severely restricted the freedom of movement of its inhabitants. In the nine-million-inhabitant metropolis of Wenzhou on the east coast of China, only one person per household is allowed to go on the street every two days to buy the most necessary for life, local authorities said. The city also closed 46 motorway toll stations.\nThe Chinese government also called on the weekend to postpone weddings and to hold mourning parties in a small framework. Travel in China, however, increased again, because on Monday the New Year holidays extended due to the virus end.\n'

"888888,0,The World Health Organization declared the spread of Coronavirus or COVID-19 as a pandemic. But most people are confused about the difference between a pandemic, an epidemic and an outbreak? The three words are quite different and mixing them would only add to confusion. The main difference between the three is the scale of the spread of the disease.\nSo, to make things easier, we have explained the difference between the words -- pandemic, epidemic and outbreak and how they are used.\nIn this case, the disease spread is on a small scale and unusual. The number of cases is usually small and the area that the disease covers is small as well.\nFor example, a case wherein around 10-20 kids in a class come down with a stomach flu is an outbreak.\nNew diseases give rise to outbreaks as it is immediately noticeable since the symptoms are new.\nAn outbreak usually spurs health agencies into action regarding containing the outbreak.\nIn this case, the disease is on a bigger scale and spreading.\nAn epidemic covers a much larger geographical area than an outbreak.\nWhen the Coronavirus or COVID-19 cases started to come up outside Wuhan in China, it was noted that the Coronavirus outbreak was turning into a Coronavirus epidemic.\nIn this case, the disease is on an international scale and out of control.\nWhen an epidemic spreads to multiple countries, it is considered to be a pandemic. A pandemic is the highest level of global health emergency.\nIn recorded history, WHO has declared only two pandemics -- for influenza in 1918 and for influenza H1N1 in 2009. So, Coronavirus being declared a pandemic is a historic event.\nSometimes, epidemiologists consider a situation to be a pandemic only when the disease affects some new areas and sustains there through local transmission.\nThe term pandemic has a connotation of fear. A pandemic is not easily controllable, often not controllable at all, and health agencies use the term to spread awareness of the seriousness of the disease spread. This word doesn't mean that suddenly any new measures are being taken to combat Coronavirus. It has no legal meaning\n"
'888888,0,The United States is the first infected country where Wuhan pneumonia has spread to the outside world: a Chinese working in Seattle returned to work after visiting his family in Wuhan, and soon had a fever and cough. The health authorities in Seattle released the condition of the Chinese for the first time, treated him effectively, and provided relevant data to China. At present, five patients with Wuhan pneumonia have been found in the United States, all of them Chinese who have been to China. The Institute of allergy and infectious diseases of the National Institutes of health and the Department of medical research of several universities announced the development of a new Wuhan coronavirus vaccine. After three months, the clinical trial will take place in a year. Five major airports in the United States have screened passengers from Wuhan, and the State Council has upgraded the travel warning to Wuhan from level 2 to level 4. The State Council decided to send a transfer flight on January 28 to bring back all American citizens in Wuhan. The mainstream media in the United States put the news of Wuhan pneumonia in an important position to report, and expressed shock and wonder that the Chinese Communist government closed Wuhan, with a population of more than 10 million, and cut off all contact with the outside world. Americans don\'t believe what the Chinese authorities say. There are only 2000 people infected and more than 80 people died in Wuhan. They know that the epidemic in Wuhan is more than several times and dozens of times more serious than that announced by the Chinese authorities. However, the United States did not close its doors to the Chinese like China\'s brother North Korea, but some Chinese public opinions refer to Wuhan pneumonia as a biological and chemical weapon used by the United States to prevent the rise of China\'s great power. In the United States, of course, the most concerned about Wuhan pneumonia is 5 million Chinese in the United States, most of them come from mainland China, and everyone has relatives or friends in China. These days, when they meet each other, they have to exchange their own information, each of which carries terror and death. This spring festival\'s new year\'s Eve meal, because of the concern for domestic relatives and friends, has no taste. Chinese in the United States watch CCTV\'s "Spring Festival Gala" every year. Although the "Spring Festival Gala" is more and more like "chicken ribs", which is tasteless and regrettable to be abandoned, it is always entertainment from the motherland, which is better than nothing. This year, many Chinese in the United States hope CCTV to cancel the "Spring Festival Gala", but on the thirties of this year, they see the "Spring Festival Gala" on TV, which is indeed regardless of the helpless Wuhan people The fear of life and death and the enveloped land of China, singing, dancing, rising, and joyful, are not ashamed to celebrate Xi Jinping\'s new socialist era. This year\'s Spring Festival Gala, in the eyes of many Chinese Americans, is not only "chicken ribs", but also dehumanizing\n。 At present, Chinese from all over the United States are voluntarily donating to buy masks for Wuhan citizens and medical staff. Some people have proposed to buy at least 10 million masks. A Chinese in Los Angeles took a donation to a warehouse store to buy all the masks in the store. The manager asked the reason and gave all the masks to the buyer free of charge. The problem now is that Chinese Americans don\'t know who to give the masks they bought, and there is no official institution in China to accept overseas donations. The United States is looking at Wuhan, not only to help Wuhan find a good medicine against the new coronavirus, but also to continue to provide China with real information about Wuhan pneumonia. Recently, the US online science journal wired published the model inference of authoritative virologists, pointing out that by February 4, Wuhan will have more than 190000 people infected with pneumonia, more in the country, and may become the most serious worldwide infectious disease after the Spanish influenza outbreak in 1918. In order to control the spread of pneumonia in Wuhan, 75% of the infectious sources must be controlled, but it has not been done. Before the closure of the city, there were 150000 people flowing out of Wuhan to the whole country every day, and only Tibet was left in China without any cases of infection. According to the false data provided by the CPC authorities, who concluded that Wuhan pneumonia did not constitute a public health emergency of international concern. One day, who will prove that they helped the Chinese government hide the truth about Wuhan pneumonia from the world. The Communist Party of China conceals the real situation of Wuhan pneumonia, while the United States continues to send real information about Wuhan pneumonia to the world. People can see the comments of Chinese netizens on the Internet: Fortunately, the world is not only China, but also the United States.\n'

'888888,0,BEIJING (Reuters) - The death from coronavirus of a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about the disease triggered a wave of public mourning on Friday and rare expressions of anger against the government online.\nLi Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at a hospital in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak, became one of the most visible figures in the crisis after he revealed he was one of eight people reproached by Wuhan police last month for “spreading rumours” about the coronavirus.\nNews of Li’s death at age 34 became the top-read topic on China’s microblogging site Weibo on Friday, with over 1.5 billion views, and was also heavily discussed in private WeChat messaging groups, where people expressed outrage and sadness.\nThere were also signs that discussions of his death were being censored, especially ones that blamed the government. Topics tagged “the Wuhan government owes Doctor Li Wenliang an apology” and “we want free speech” briefly trended on Weibo late on Thursday, but yielded no search results on Friday.\nA selfie of him lying on a hospital bed earlier this week wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card was being shared widely.\nLi said on Weibo on Feb. 1 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.\nReuters has been unable to reach Li’s family.\n“Light a candle and pay tribute to the hero,” said one Weibo commentator. “You were the beam of light in the night.” An image also posted on Weibo showed a message, “farewell Li Wenliang”, carved into the snow on a riverbank in Beijing.\nLi’s case is a tricky one for China’s leadership after Beijing was accused of covering up the full extent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Beijing has called for transparency in the current crisis, and local officials have come in for public blame over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak\n.\n“Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology. Wuhan and Hubei officials also owe a solemn apology to the people of Hubei and this country,” Hu Xijin, the editor of the ruling Communist Party-backed Global Times tabloid, said in a Weibo post.\nReports of Li’s death surfaced on state media before midnight local time on Thursday in China, were removed, and then reappeared early on Friday.\nThe Wuhan hospital where Li worked said on its Weibo account that he died at 2:58 a.m. local time on Friday.\nChina’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which punishes official corruption, said on Friday it would send investigators to Wuhan to probe “issues raised by the people in connection with Dr. Li Wenliang.” It gave no further details.\n“The CCDI has now sent an investigation team to carry out a full probe in response to public concerns and to allow people to look forward to the revealing of the full truth,” the official People’s Daily wrote in an editorial.\nAt a news conference in Wuhan on Friday, the city’s vice mayor Hu Yabo said he was “deeply grieved” at the death of Li Wenliang and others who have been killed by the virus, and would fully cooperate with the investigation.\nThe World Health Organization said on Twitter that it was “deeply saddened” by news of his death, while China’s National Health Commission and the Wuhan government also issued statements of condolence.\nSome Chinese media outlets described him as a “hero who was willing to speak the truth”, while other commentators posted poems, photos and drawings saluting him.\nOn WeChat, some users posted links to the song from Les Miserables’, “Do You Hear the People Sing?”, which was sung during protest movements in Hong Kong and South Korea. Some people organised an online petition to the State Council making demands such as punishing local Wuhan officials.\nChina has reported more than 630 deaths and 30,000 cases of the coronavirus.\n'

We\'re not even half-way through this," said Joseph Kanter of the Louisiana Department of Health, which has recorded more than 2,700 cases, more than five times what it had a week ago.\nNew Orleans\' sprawling Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, along the Mississippi River, was being converted into a massive hospital as officials prepared for thousands more patients than they could accommodate.\nThe preparations immediately conjured images of another disaster, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the convention center became a squalid shelter of last resort in a city that has braved a string of storm hits, not to mention great fires and a yellow fever epidemic in centuries past.\nAs the new health crisis loomed, economic catastrophe had already arrived in the city, where many already live in poverty and the tourism industry has screeched to a halt.\n"I\'ve never been unemployed. But now, all of a sudden: Wop!" said John Moore, the musician best known as Deacon John, who has no gigs to perform with much of the city shut down.\n"It ain\'t just me. It\'s everybody."

Lawmakers in both parties lined up behind the law to send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system.\nThe US neared 100,000 confirmed cases, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Italy, the US and China account for nearly half the world\'s more than 585,000 infections and more than half of the roughly 26,000 reported virus deaths.\nDr. John Brooks of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans remained "in the acceleration phase" of the pandemic and that all corners of the country were at risk.\n"There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this," he said.\nIn a phone call Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Trump that China "stands ready to provide support within its capacity," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\nTrump, who has repeatedly referred to the outbreak as a "Chinese virus," struck a different tone Friday, tweeting after the call that "China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!" In Europe, Italy recorded its single biggest 24-hour rise in deaths, with 969 more victims, to bring its total number of fatalities to 9,134.\nThe country now has more than 86,000 cases, surpassing China to record the grim distinction of the second-most infections in the world, behind the U.S.\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella called it "a sad page in our history."\nItalian epidemiologists warn that the country\'s number of cases is likely much higher than reported - perhaps by five times - although two weeks into a nationwide lockdown the daily increase seems to be slowing, at least in northern Italy.\n\'\'It is something devastating,\'\' said the Rev. Mario Carminati, whose church in the tiny Lombardy town of Seriate has been used to hold coffins of the dead before they are taken by military convoy for cremation.\nSpain, with the world\'s fourth-biggest number of cases, reported another 7,800 infections for a total of more than 64,000. The country said health workers accounted for about 15 percent of its cases.\nDeaths in Spain climbed past 4,900 - the world\'s second-highest total after Italy.\nIn Britain, Boris Johnson\'s office said the prime minister was tested after showing mild symptoms for the coronavirus. He was self-isolating and continuing to lead Britain\'s response to the pandemic.\n"Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team, to lead the national fightback against coronavirus," Johnson said in a video message, adding that he had a temperature and persistent cough.\n'

This has not been done anywhere in the world because the suitability is not very high, the disease has not spread, and it is easy to spread.\n-Know how covid-2019 came out? Is there a known virus mutation? Is it true that bats are all kinds of crown carriers?\n-New crown light sources have not been fully installed, but bats are considered a potential source of transmissioAbout It is a common fact that viruses can be transmitted from animals to humans or, as we say, can overcome interspecific barriers.\n-What is covid-2019 different from other Colorado States? The WHO says it has never encountered the virus before, and in a sense it is unique. What do you mean?\n-The gene analysis of the new virus showed that its structure was consistent with that of other known coronaviruses, the proportion consistent with SARS virus was 85%, and the proportion consistent with mers virus was 15%. It\'s a combination of genes, it\'s unique.\n-Most of the infected people have mild illness. The elderly are at the greatest risk, while children are vulnerable to infection. What is this about?\n-The fact that children are more susceptible to disease has been established, but there is no clear explanation. It is believed that the adult tissue structure is more suitable for virus reproduction than the child tissue. In addition, the elderly have more related diseases and chronic diseases than children, which may complicate the occurrence of diseases. This is also true of other infectious diseases, such as influenza.\n-Should people who are afraid of being infected with coronavirus take some kind of medicine to improve their immunity?\n-It\'s best to ask a clinician or an infected person about this problemAbout However, as far as I know, who has not yet recommended such preventive measures based on the experience of countries with high HIV prevalence. Yes, there are some drugs that can be used for treatment, but there is no point in using them for prevention.\nTell me about typical symptoms. Can a person carry a virus without showing it?\n-Main symptoms - temperature rise, cough, dyspnea, dyspnea. Before symptoms appear, how many diseases a person can infect, and whether he can infect as many diseases without symptoms, remains to be studied.\nWhat is the mechanism of virus transmission? For example, can patients take the same bus or subway car to infect? Or it should be closer contact)（\n-As with influenza, the main route of infection is air-water droplets. In other words, it can be transmitted in public transportation. Of course, close contact with the patient will help the infectioAbout\nIs it reasonable to wear a mask on the street? Or should they just wear in a closed space?\n-As mentioned before, the main route of transmission is air droplet. The mask can prevent the invasion of large droplets and aerosols, Formed when the patient sneezes and coughs. Therefore, it is recommended to put on the mask to the sick people first, so as to prevent them from infecting the people around them, that is, those who take care of the patients. Close contact with the sick)（\nAs for other healthy people, the world health organization does not recommend that they wear masks, which may create the illusion of full protection and divert people\'s attention. Take other necessary and effective measures. This includes carefully washing hands and keeping a distance (1,5-2m) from anyone who has signs of illness after leaving home and contacting the outside world 2. Avoid visiting densely populated areas without urgent need and take other simple precautions.\nIn addition, the mask should be replaced every two hours, because it will soon get wet, lose efficiency, dyspnea, cause irritation, and cause a certain degree of discomfort. This is because the mask is easy to get wet and uncomfortable. Make people feel worse.\nTherefore, it is generally not recommended to wear masks for healthy people. But every specific situation must also be taken into accountAbout If, for example, you take a bus or a plane, that is to say You\'re a long-term traveler, and in a limited space, sitting next to you coughing and coughing people, Sneezing should be done with a handkerchief, napkin or, in extreme cases, with an elbow, but not in the palm of your hand It makes sense, of course, to put on a mask.\n-Can coronaviruses be tested before the first symptoms of the disease occur, for example, to avoid transmission to family or friends?\n-In Belarus, autopsies were carried out in China, Iran, Italy and the Republic of Korea over the past 14 days. Who is in close contact with patients with coronavirus infection diagnosed. Others can only be tested in the laboratory with epidemiological and clinical evidence and under the guidance of doctors.\nHowever, we are now seeing a seasonal rise in acute respiratory infections and influenza. While these infections are being monitored, patients with severe respiratory diseases are being examined every year, including the tests we are now doing in ColoradoAbout\n-What kind of diagnosis is in your center? Do I understand correctly that the biomaterials of a potentially contaminated person are studied by several laboratories at the same time? Or is all the material coming into RNA as a lead agency?\n-Materials were studied in one laboratory, but in some cases, such as in quarantine of personnel, they were examined in two independent laboratories to improve reliability. In addition, if the result is positive, test the sample with a set of reagents from another manufacturer.\n-Previously, at a press conference, the national director of Health reported that the results of the coronavirus study obtained by the Belarusian laboratory would be sent to the WHO reference laboratory. What is the purpose of this?\n-There are three types of our centers: domestic production and foreign centers from Russia and the World Health Organization.\nThese diagnostic packages are designed on the basis of modern molecular and biological methods in accordance with who protocols that meet the best international standards. These kits are currently being used around the world.\nSome Republic reference centres and reference laboratories, including the national influenza centre, operate nationwideAbout The regulations of these centres stipulate that biological samples should be exchanged frequently and sent to the WHO reference laboratory, the infection analysis laboratory. This is the daily activity of any reference laboratory.\n-Do I correctly recognize that covid-2019 includes domestic test systems?\n-As soon as the virus spread in China, we started to study this problem. Who places a specific nucleotide sequence on a general visit, This enables us to synthesize so-called raw materials into real-time PDA detection. All countries with relevant laboratories can produce and use a set of reagents. Belarus has no problems in this regard. Our technology is very developed, with high-quality staff. So, since January, we have had our own diagnostic package. The drugs have not yet been registered because registration takes a long time.\nComparing all the samples at home and abroad, we can see their uniqueness. However, the positive results of the Colorado virus were reviewed in all three test systems. So far, there are no differences, which shows that they are exactly the same. In general, we have done a lot of research - more than 5000About\nWe have the technology, we can solve any infection. In Ebola, by the way, we have registered our own research. Check for students from countries where the virus has spread. Fortunately, nothing was planted on our territory at that time.\n-Is there any other diagnostic drug for coronavirus in Belarus?\nYes, we have such drugs, especially a set of coronary gene reagents, "PCR mode for detecting genetic material of respiratory coronavirus 229E, nl63, betacov 1, hku1. People in clinical materials. That is, technology)（\nThe development of new products and the expansion of production scale depend on the specific situation. Most importantly, we have, develop and support these technologies, and we can produce any new drug to diagnose any infection, no matter what exotic it is.\n-Do experts in your center often study biomaterials of patients who may have other particularly dangerous infectious diseases?\n-Today\'s world is more transparent than ever, and it\'s impossible to rule out new exotic infections, including particularly dangerous oneAbout Therefore, we prepare and regularly investigate the disease.\n-In your opinion, what measures need to be taken to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus?\n-Necessary measures have been taken. All of these are based on international experience, which has been tested many times and proved to be effective in dealing with various biological threats（\nAs for the propagation probability of covid-2019, it is. But I believe that the activities of the Ministry of health and other agencies in our country today will help to prevent the large-scale spread of the virus. We have good epidemiological supervision and health services have been strengthened. We track all those who are infected, all those who are in contact, and we are proactive. The World Health Organization also appreciates Belarus\'s efforts.\n-Will the vaccine being developed become a panacea for coronavirus?\n-My personal view as a microbiologist is that the virus will spread faster in countries than it can develop an effective vaccine. I believe that diseases will happen naturally, such as SARS, mers, etc. However, vaccines must be developed for the futureAbout If it is developed before the next possible coronavirus epidemic, it can be modified to improve the impact of the immune system.\n-What can we predict? In China, when the situation is stable, will covid-2019 continue to spread in China?\nThe prediction of each virus strain is unique. Therefore, even the epidemiologists with world reputation can not answer this question fully and reliably.\nIf we take a look at how this has developed in countries that have become popular before, such as China or Italy, it is predictable. Within one or two months, the incidence will be stable to some extent. So if we have some kind of growth, then in a fairly short period of time, the situation will decline. Although we now have a single case of Colorado virus.\nOf course, there may be different developments, but there are good reasons to say that, like China, we will not have large-scale disease transmission. Climate and population density are affected by various factors. Before we didn\'t know what SARS and mers were, we were worried about the possible spread of the disease. However, the incidence lasted only a few months. Therefore, it is assumed that the incidence of coronary artery disease and all acute respiratory diseases will decrease in Russia by May JuneAbout\nSvetlana vasilievskaya,\nBeta'
"888888,0,If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\nThis was what legendary Chinese strategist Sun Tzu said in his the Art of War in the times when Gautam Buddha was preaching good ways of life in India.\nNow replace the word 'enemy' in the opening paragraph with novel coronavirus and read the three sentences again. This new enemy has emerged from China and brought the whole world to its knees. It needs to be fought with full might.\nThis fact cannot be overstated that the world - as individuals, agencies and the governments - needs to have full clarity about novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, a disease that turns certain existing ailments into killer ones.\nNovel coronavirus itself is not a new virus. It is believed to have been living peacefully in its host, bats, the mammal cousins of humans. Some time in November last year, this novel coronavirus - now officially named SARS-CoV-2 or sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 - made the journey from bats through some intermediary animal to humans in Chinese business hub of Wuhan.\nNow, novel coronavirus is a human virus. And, it is a new virus for human body. The novel coronavirus being new means the body does not know the mechanism how to fight this unknown enemy. It also means there is no readily available medicine to nutralise novel coronavirus in human body.\nMedical science, the unique power of well-being, is using all its skills and might to come out with a solution. Now, there is at least some understanding about how this new virus behaves.\nAccording to a newly published paper, the novel coronavirus lives longer on some surfaces such as plastic and steel more than other, say cardboard or copper. Knowing stability of novel coronavirus is important to understand its virility or its ability to infect a healthy person.\nBut on a copper surface, no viable novel coronavirus could be found during the study after four hours. This means copper utensils and door knobs are safer than those made up of plastic or steel.\nOn cardboards used for packaging most of the items we order online, the novel coronavirus does not stay viable for more than 24 hours. This means your online orders in most cases are safe unless the delivery boy had the infection and sneezed on it.\nSome other studies have found that novel coronavirus remains suspended in air in the form of droplets - called aerosols -- formed through sneezing and coughing. The usual time of suspension is about 30 minutes. But they can stay suspended for up to two hours. Gravity brings them down and the chances of the novel coronavirus trapped inside those droplets entering a human's respiratory tract get reduced to minimum this way.\nHowever, in some cases, the novel coronavirus containing aerosols have travelled up to the ventilator of isolation wards of the Covid-19 patients. This is against the hitherto held view that novel coronavirus does not travel through air.\nTo believe that novel coronavirus does not travel through air and start falling could be misleading. This puts health workers at greater risk if they are attending to novel coronavirus patients.\nThis also means healthy people visiting hospitals without adequate protective gear are at the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus and become a vector of Covid-19 even if they don't immediately show symptoms.\nTo put it in simpler words, it is important to remember that touch is not the only way to get infected by novel coronavirus. Since people cannot stay long without breathing, visiting such places where novel coronavirus laden aerosols are suspended, falling or travelling in air can make a healthy person a Covid-19 patient.\nThe good part is that the scientists working on the novel coronavirus have found that the contagion in such aerosols loses its ability to infect very fast. And, even a 10-minute time lag reduces the chances of spread significantly.\nAvoiding this enemy is the key. With Scientists working to know novel coronavirus more and more every day, this knowledge is the weapon to protect oneself and let the virus die its own death.\n"

'888888,0,SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian airlines face “drastic” cuts in their planned growth because of the coronavirus crisis, an industry group warned, adding gloom to an already depleted Singapore Airshow as more companies scaled back plans on Monday.\nThe Singapore Airshow from Feb. 11 to 16 is proceeding, but the exhibition center is pockmarked with empty spaces that would have held displays from Chinese companies and others skipping the show because of the epidemic, which has killed more than 900 people.\nMore than 70 exhibitors, including major U.S. defense firms Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co have pulled out over concerns related to the new coronavirus.\nFew deals are expected at the biennial event, where the epidemic has triggered new safety measures and cast a shadow over airline profits and demand for airplanes.\nBefore the coronavirus hit, the International Air Transport Association had expected passenger numbers to rise by 4% in 2020 and cargo traffic to be 2% higher.\n“All bets are off in terms of traffic forecasts for this year,” Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines, said in an interview.\n“If you look at the schedule cuts and the actual operations they have been cut by 50%, 60%, 70% within China. It is pretty drastic,” he said.\nThe Pentagon reduced the size of its delegation to the air show, which had been set to include its chief weapons buyer, U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Ellen Lord, Reuters reported on Friday.\nSingapore on Friday raised its alert level for the coronavirus outbreak to orange, the same level reached during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS) pandemic, sparking panic buying at supermarkets across the island.\nThere are 43 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Singapore\n. The orange alert level advises organizers to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events and recommends precautions such as temperature screening and more frequent cleaning of common areas for those that do proceed.\nHealth experts, however, said they were concerned that temperature screening might not be effective, given reports the coronavirus could be spread by people without symptoms.\n“Temperature screening is okay to pick up people already sick - and those people should not be coming to the show anyway - but doesn’t pick up people incubating the virus,” said John McBride, an infectious disease physician and professor at Australia’s James Cook University.\nSIA Engineering Company Ltd and GE Aviation on Monday said they had postponed plans to hold a groundbreaking ceremony for a new engine overhaul facility in Singapore on Tuesday until further notice because of the raised alert level.\nSaudi Arabia’s General Authority for Military Industries withdrew from the show late Sunday, citing concerns associated with the coronavirus.\nThe air show’s organizers said on Sunday they were expecting more than 930 companies from 45 countries and 45,000 trade attendees - down from the 54,000 at the last show in 2018. They also plan to limit public attendance.\nThe lobbies of major hotels, usually bustling with attendees, were noticeably quiet.\nA spokeswoman for the organizers on Monday declined to provide an update on numbers and why the air show was going ahead when many smaller associated events and briefings were being canceled over coronavirus concerns.\nCancelling the show would lead to refunds running into the tens of millions of dollars, a source at one of the exhibitors told Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nOrganiser Experia Events, partly owned by ST Engineering and government agencies, charges at least S$1,550 per square meter for space in the show’s exhibition hall, according to its website\n.\nThat would equate to more than S$3 million  ($2.16 million) for ST Engineering’s booth, the show’s largest at more than 2,000 square meters.

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — The Government has not waived or reduced foreign worker levies to cushion the impact of\xa0the Covid-19 outbreak because\xa0it wants to focus on preserving\xa0jobs for Singaporeans and to encourage\xa0restructuring, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo told Parliament on Wednesday (Feb 26). \n Ms Teo spoke after two labour Members of Parliament (MPs) made speeches calling for foreign worker levy cuts, similar to those implemented during\xa0the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak. \n The MPs are Mr Seah Kian Peng of\xa0Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency (GRC)\xa0and Nominated MP Arasu Duraisamy, who is a member of the National Trades Union Congress’ central committee. \n Nominated MP Douglas Foo, president of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation, said that business operators are\xa0hoping\xa0for the Government to “extend a further helping hand” by suspending or waiving levy collection for existing work permit holders during this uncertain period. \n Ms Teo, however, said that the Government’s priority\xa0in supporting businesses is\xa0to “preserve local employment”, adding that a levy waiver or a cut “will not benefit the many employers who only have local employees”. \n Waiving or cutting levies will\xa0also “blunt the motivation” among businesses to restructure, improve job quality and become leaner in manpower, she pointed out. “We would not have seen how industries can rise to the occasion.” \n Ms Teo cited the example of the hotel industry that\xa0has shown resolve and creativity in overcoming their manpower constraints. \n For instance, housekeepers at Copthorne King hotel on Havelock Road no longer waste time knocking on doors to figure out which room should be cleaned and are now notified through a mobile application, which\xa0is linked to an in-room control unit that also turns off electrical power when guests have left. \n And Andaz Hotel in the Beach Road area no longer has a team of confectioners in its kitchen and instead keeps its customers happy with supplies from Tiong Bahru Bakery and cleverly brands this as part of the heritage experience for guests, she pointed out. \n “As much as we want to help businesses, measures to deal with the short-term fallout should not negate longer-term efforts for companies to become less reliant on foreign manpower for growth,” Ms Teo said. \n “Levy waivers or reductions would\xa0run counter to both objectives.” \n The tourism, food-and-beverage and retail\xa0sectors, for example, have been hit hard\xa0by the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Ms Teo reminded the House of the Budget this year where\xa060 per cent of the S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package\xa0would go to the Jobs Support Scheme and enhanced Wage Credit Scheme, which would benefit firms with Singaporean\xa0staff members. \n On the upside, she noted that the Government has not raised levies this time round. They had stayed the same since 2017 for the construction sector, and since 2016 or earlier for other sectors. \n The levy rates for workers in the marine shipyard and process sectors were supposed to go up\xa0by between S$50 and S$150 in 2018 and 2019, but those increases\xa0were deferred. \n The levy rate for the basic tier of S-Pass holders is at S$330, while the levy rate for other S-Pass holders is S$650. Levy rates for work permit holders are between S$250 and S$950. \n While there is no change to these levy rates, Ms Teo said that the Government had acted to waive levies for employers whose foreign workers are required to serve quarantine, leave of absence or stay-home notices after they have recently travelled to China. \n ALTERNATIVES TO NO-PAY LEAVE AND LAYOFFS \n Ms Teo said that companies with excess employees should consider other options instead of getting their workers to go on no-pay leave or laying them off. \n She highlighted that the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment recommends redeploying the workers to other work areas, giving them shorter work weeks, implementing job-sharing, or introducing adjustments to certain wage components. \n “These options would at least maintain most, if not all, of the workers’ past incomes,” she said. \n For employers with excess foreign workers, the Singapore Business Federation will administer a temporary scheme to help transfer the workers to employers with manpower shortages, she said. \n This will help employers whose workers from China\xa0have not obtained approval to return to Singapore and employers who cannot hire new\xa0workers ho are Chinese\xa0nationals due to suspended approvals. \n Ms Teo said that\xa0companies are already proactively considering such sensible measures that do not just cut costs but save jobs and she is heartened by their efforts. \n Some are asking their workers to clear their annual leave or time off, and others are exploring shorter work weeks while getting\xa0their workers to for for training to for upskill themselves. \n The disease outbreak has\xa0sparked a “viral interest” among workers in using technology for alternative work arrangements, she said. \n Even mature workers who were struggling to pick up digital tools had found ways to work virtually “almost overnight”, she noted. \n '
'888888,0,(Reuters) - A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health issues became the United States’ first fatality from the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday, as the Trump administration stepped up efforts to combat the spread of the global outbreak.\nThe patient, who was chronically ill prior to contracting COVID-19, died at EvergreenHealth Hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department’s communicable disease unit.\nThe state has recorded two other “presumptive” coronavirus cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, he said.\n“At this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that’s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,” Duchin said.\nThe two cases at the Kirkland facility were a health care worker in her 40s who is in satisfactory condition, and a woman in her 70s who lived there and is in serious condition.\n“It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,” the state’s governor, Jay Inslee, said in a statement. “We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.”\nThe first U.S. coronavirus death capped a week of stock market upheaval and escalating concern among state and federal health officials as the virus has spread across 46 countries and infected more than 60 people in the United States.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said lawmakers would take up a coronavirus spending bill next week “to advance a strong emergency funding supplemental package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis”.\nMost of the U.S. cases have occurred in travelers who were repatriated from China, where the virus originated.\nBut public health officials have also identified coronavirus cases in California, Washington and Oregon with no direct ties to the virus’ source in China, signaling a turning point in strategies needed to contain the disease in the United States.\nU.S. health authorities say it means the respiratory disease that has infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,800 in China is no longer an imported phenomenon but has taken up residence in the United States.\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here\n“We still judge the general risk to the American public to be low and that includes residents of long-term care facilities,” Nancy Messonier, head of the Immunization and Respiratory Disease division at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told reporters in a call on Saturday.\nMessonnier said the agency would send teams to support investigations in California and Washington into how patients contracted the virus and help trace who else may have been exposed.\nReuters graphics on the new coronavirus: here\nPERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted just 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the supposed epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nHealth officials said the advent of locally transmitted infections means authorities need to expand their focus from detecting a relatively limited number of cases, identifying close contacts and isolating them, to one that also emphasizes greater prevention among the public at large.\nIn particular, individuals should be more vigilant about basic hygiene measures, such as washing hands often, avoiding touching their faces, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home from school or work whenever ill, health officials say.\nCoronavirus is spread primarily through tiny droplets coughed or sneezed directly from an infected person into the face of someone nearby, as opposed to the more contagious “airborne” transmission of a virus like measles, which can remain suspended in enclosed spaces and be breathed in hours after being exhaled by sick individuals, experts say.\nCoronavirus can also survive on surfaces, such as handrails and door knobs, for “a very long period of time,” and be picked up by hand that way, though the virus is “very susceptible” to cleaning products, Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said on Friday in Santa Clara County.\nStill, “It’s mostly a person-to-person transmission that we are concerned about for our communities,” he added.\nFor the online coverage of the coronavirus outbreak click, here\n'

'888888,0,SINGAPORE (Reuters) - PetroChina, China’s second-biggest state refiner, plans to reduce its crude throughput by 320,000 barrels per day (bpd) this month versus its original plan as the Wuhan virus hits fuel demand, a company official told Reuters on Monday.\nPetroChina’s planned February cut is equivalent to about 10% of the refiner’s average production rate of around 3.32 million bpd. This would bring total production scalebacks by state refiners, include Sinopec Corp and China National Offshore Oil Company, to around 940,000 bpd for this month.\nThe cuts from PetroChina are likely to be deepened to 377,000 bpd in March, said the senior company official with direct knowledge of the matter. He declined to be named as he’s not authorized to speak to the press.\nReuters reported last week that Sinopec Corp, Asia’s largest refiner, is cutting its throughput this month by 600,000 bpd, or 12% of its average crude runs, its deepest reduction in over a decade. Independent Chinese refiners in Shandong, meanwhile, have slashed output to below half their capacity.\n“The production cuts are mostly on refineries in northeast and north China, where demand is hit harder than in the western parts of the country,” said the PetroChina official.\nPetroChina started the production cuts at the beginning of the month, but deepened them on Monday, the official said.\nPetroChina did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nPetroChina is talking with its key long-term suppliers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates about possibly deferring cargo loadings or trimming loading volumes, the official said, without giving further details.\n“We’re monitoring the market on a daily basis.

It is not known how the man in his 50s was infected.\nAmid fears of a widespread outbreak, Attorney-General Christian Porter said Australia will expand the use of a rarely used law that would either designate some places as out of bounds or place the patient in home detention.\n“Under the biosecurity act, you could have the prevention of movement from persons in and out of particular places,” Porter told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n“You might have a major sporting event where people would be in very, very close proximity to each other and... it might be determined that the risk of transmission at a venue like that was too high.”\nThe law, enacted in 2015, has rarely been used outside Australia’s agricultural sector.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison last week said a pandemic was likely and Australia has moved to try and prevent the virus from reaching its shores.\nSince Feb. 1 Australia has stopped any foreigner from entering directly from China - its largest trading partner. The move has prevented thousands of students and tourists from entering Australia.\nSome Chinese students have traveled to a third country for two weeks, the incubation period for the coronavirus, which satisfies Australia’s quarantine restrictions.\nOne Chinese student who spent two weeks in Dubai was on Tuesday confirmed as Australia’s 34th case of coronavirus.\nAustralia has had one death, a 78-year-old man who was a former passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which was quarantined in Japan.\nKeen to temper fears, Morrison urged Australians to remain calm as some rushed to shops to stock up on supplies in case of a pandemic or restrictions of movement.\nMorrison said he has spoken with Australia’s two largest retailers, Coles (COL.AX) and Woolworths (WOW.AX).\n“They would send the same message I am sending you today.

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — As food and beverage (F&B) businesses take a hit due to the Covid-19 outbreak in Singapore, Jewel Changi Airport is now offering a 50 per cent rebate on rent for its F&B tenants for the months of February and March.\xa0 \n The Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) revealed this during a press conference on Thursday (Feb 13) and calls for other landlords to follow suit to help them ride through this crisis.\xa0 \n Jewel, a retail and leisure complex, opened less than a year ago. \n On Monday and Tuesday, the association sent out letters to 24 landlords — some of them major mall developers such as CapitaLand and Asia Malls — requesting that they offer rental rebates of up to 50 per cent for the months of February, March and April.\xa0 \n RAS has more than 450 members representing close to 700 brands that operate more than 4,000 outlets. \n Based on a snap poll the association conducted among its members from Monday to Thursday, 57 per cent of the 302 respondents said that they expect revenue to drop by more than half over the next three months.\xa0 \n Close to 60 per cent said that they are not prepared or equipped to deal with the abrupt nature of the virus outbreak.\xa0 \n Respondents also said that measures to address wage and rental costs were their top two areas of concern. \n The novel coronavirus, now known officially as Covid-19, originated in Wuhan of China’s Hubei province, and has now spread to 28 countries, including Singapore.\xa0 \n On Thursday, the Ministry of Health announced eight new people who were infected with Covid-10, bringing the total number of diagnosed cases to 58, the highest number in the world outside of China.\xa0 \n RAS’ president Vincent Tan said that the F&B sector has reported a 50 to 80 per cent decline in business since the virus outbreak, with more shoppers staying home and avoiding malls or other crowded places.\xa0 \n “If we don’t do something to help the industry, there will be a big collapse,” he said.\xa0 \n LANDLORDS NEED TO BE ‘SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE’\xa0 \n As rent makes up a high proportion of operational costs for restauranteurs, RAS is calling on landlords to be “socially responsible”.\xa0 \n Mr Andrew Tjioe, president adviser of the association and also chief executive officer of Tung Lok Group, said that they are trying to avoid a situation where they have to ask their employees to go on unpaid leave.\xa0 \n “I think we really want to avoid this. This is the time that landlords and tenants have to be in good partnership and landlords have to do the social responsible thing to help us protect jobs,” Mr Tjioe said.\xa0 \n “You can see how our landlords are performing financially, and there is an imbalance of distribution of income. It’s a very, very heavy burden on F&B operators,” he added, saying that both landlords and tenants need each other to survive.\xa0 \n The association said that restaurants are starting to engage fewer part-time workers and some have even started asking full-time staff members to go on unpaid leave.\xa0 \n While there are no closures yet, Mr Tan said that many restaurants are now quite empty as shoppers avoid malls.\xa0 \n Referring to how the sector suffered back in 2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) disease struck, Mr Tan recalled that business bounced back only six months after the outbreak ended.\xa0 \n “So we need to help (restaurants) these three to six months. Let us overcome the situation. We are not asking for long-term rental rebates. We are asking for help to ride through this very difficult time,” Mr Tan said.\xa0\xa0 \n  The Restaurant Association of Singapore told reporters at a press conference that it is appealing to landlords and the Ministry of Trade and Industry for support to tide through the slump during the Covid-19 outbreak. Photo: Janice Lim/TODAY \n In Hong Kong, reports have emerged that landlords of major malls are cutting rents for the month of February by as much as 60 per cent to help tenants through the coronavirus outbreak.\xa0 \n When asked whether RAS have received any response from any of the 24 landlords, the association said that some have replied by saying that they wish to understand the situation more and speak to the individual tenants directly.\xa0 \n While RAS recognises that landlords are trying to help tenants by bringing in more shoppers, such as CapitaLand launching a S$10 million marketing campaign, Mr Tan said that these efforts do not help them immediately.\xa0 \n A rental rebate would have a direct impact on the bottomline of the restaurants, he added.\xa0 \n ‘HAEMORRHAGING FROM ARTERIES’ \n As for the likely impact if landlords do not agree to reduce rents, Mr Andrew Kwan, vice-president of the association, said that restaurant closures would be likely because it is “just untenable”.\xa0 \n “It’s not something where you can kind of wait it out over a few months without any sort of assistance. \n “I liken this to a patient that is haemorrhaging from the arteries. We don’t have time to say that, ‘Let’s assess and let’s decide what’s the next measure’, and then slowly stop the bleeding. It’s something that is happening very rapidly,” Mr Kwan said.\xa0 \n During this period, some F&B outlets have reported an increase in food delivery orders, but the association said that this increase is not enough to cover the drastic drop in business at the physical outlets.\xa0 \n RAS has also written a letter last Sunday to Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, asking for help in these areas. \n First, it hopes that the Government can help reduce labour costs by temporarily waiving foreign worker levies and providing wage credits.\xa0 \n Second, it is appealing to government agencies such as the Housing and Development Board, National Parks Board, Singapore Tourism Board and industrial estate developer JTC to get them to offer rental rebates to their tenants as well.\xa0 \n '

'888888,0,TAIPEI - Taiwan\'s foreign minister on Saturday accused giant neighbour China of waging cyber "war" on the island to disrupt its fight against the coronavirus by using fake news, as the island Beijing claims as its own reported a jump in new cases  \n The coronavirus outbreak has strained already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing, with Taiwan especially angry at China\'s efforts to block its participation at the World Health Organization (WHO).  \n China says Taiwan is merely one of its provinces with no right to membership of the WHO. Taiwan has called China "vile" for not allowing it real time information about the virus from the WHO. China says Taiwan gets the information it needs.  \n This week Taiwan\'s government reported an increase in fake online reports about the virus on the island, and blamed China\'s "internet army" for being behind the misinformation. China has not responded to the allegations.  \n Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter that Chinese officials claim to care about the health of the Taiwanese "as if we\'re blood relatives".  \n He added: "But while #Taiwan is dealing with #COVID19 originating from #Wuhan, their cyber warriors are waging war to disrupt our efforts. So this is epidemic fighting with Chinese characteristics. I\'m speechless."  \n The fake reports, which Taiwan\'s government has quickly and strongly refuted, include claims that the island is covering up the true number of cases and that members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party get priority for face masks.  \n Taiwan says it will punish people who spread the rumours. The island has long claimed China is intentionally using fake news to undermine its democracy and people\'s faith in the government. China has previously denied the accusations.  \n Adding to the tensions, China has in recent weeks been flying fighter jets and bombers close to the island. Taiwan\'s Defence Ministry reported another case on Friday.  \n While Taiwan moved early to suspend travel links with China to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and has reported far fewer cases than China, its number of patients has continued to grow.  \n On Saturday, Taiwan reported five new cases of infection, including four people who had contact with another infected patient in a hospital and one person returning from a trip to Egypt and Dubai, bringing Taiwan\'s total to 39.  \n Taiwan has reported one death from the coronavirus, while nine patients have recovered and been released from hospital.  \n China, where the outbreak began, has reported more than 79,000 infections and over 2,800 deaths.

'888888,0,HOUSTON (AFP) - Authorities in Texas are investigating a second suspected case on US soil of a deadly Chinese virus, namely a college student who had recently returned from the city at the heart of the outbreak, officials said on Thursday (Jan 23). \n Brazos County, just north-west of Houston, "is investigating a suspected case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)," its health authority wrote in a statement on Facebook. \n "The patient travelled from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated," it added. \n The patient\'s age is somewhere between 20 and 30 and they returned to the United States, where they are attending Texas A&M University, days before health screenings began at airports on Jan 15, local health official Eric Wilke told reporters. \n "The person presented to an area emergency department yesterday mostly out of concern, not out of symptoms," said Wilke, adding that they were now being kept isolated at home while testing was performed, with the result likely to arrive over the next day or two. \n The patient had "mild upper respiratory symptoms" including cough and congestion and appeared to be improving. \n Such symptoms are common in the middle of winter flu season, but the patient was being screened further on the basis of their travel history. \n A blood sample has been sent to the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, which should arrive late on Thursday or early Friday, with a result expected within 24 hours after that. \n If the case is confirmed, the patient would be the second person to be infected with the pathogen on US soil after a man in his 30s near Seattle reported himself to authorities on Jan 19. \n That man, a US resident who also recently travelled to Wuhan, is said to be recovering well and is due to be released from hospital soon\n. \n CDC officials had already warned that there would be more cases in the US given the frequency of international travel. \n All air traffic from Wuhan is currently being funnelled through five airports where health officials have been deployed to carry out screening with questionnaires and temperature checks. \n The new respiratory virus has claimed 18 lives since emerging from a seafood and animal market in Wuhan and infected hundreds more. \n China has locked down some 20 million people at the epicenter of the outbreak, but the World Health Organisation said on Thursday the disease did not yet constitute a global health emergency. \n But it has generated alarm because of its similarity to Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.\n'

Most patients who have died are above 60 and had pre-existing conditions, according to reports from local authorities.\nThe coronavirus can be passed between humans through close contact, Chinese medical experts say.\nThe novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak may reach its peak in one week or around 10 days, Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said.\n"It is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be large-scale increases," Zhong told state-run Xinhua news agency.\nZhong is the head of a national team of experts set up for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering\n.\n"There are two keys to tackling the epidemic: early detection and early isolation. They are the most primitive and most effective methods," he said.\nZhong said fever and weakness were the typical symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection found in the majority of patients.\nTen to 14 days is a sound period for isolation and observation. When the incubation period ends, those who fall sick will get timely treatment and those who do not will be just fine, he said.\nHe suggested that hospitals be staffed with not only infectious disease specialists, but also specialists in treating severe cases to better save patients.\nEpidemiologically, the novel coronavirus is homologous to the virus discovered in a type of bat in 2017, said Zhong, adding that the 2019-nCoV probably has an intermediate host that may be a certain kind of wild animal.\n"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak lasted about six months, but I don\'t believe the novel coronavirus outbreak would last that long," said Zhong.\nThe country has taken a series of powerful measures, especially early detection and early isolation.\n"We have sufficient confidence in preventing a major outbreak or a recurrence as long as the two measures are in place, although we still need to conduct much scientific research," he said.\nNoting that the key for Wuhan is how to reduce infections inside hospitals, Zhong said he supported the construction of makeshift hospitals in the city to control the infectious disease.\nThe activation of top-level public health emergency response was aimed at reducing the chance of infection, he said, adding that the vaccine development may need three to four months or even longer.\n"Now scientists are speeding up research of neutralizing antibodies of the virus, but it takes time. With help from across the country, Wuhan, a heroic city, will pull through," Zhong said.\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called the coronavirus a "demon" which should be brought under control\n.\nChina has ramped up efforts to contain the virus. The country has extended the New Year Festival holidays till February 2 to prevent reverse migration of millions of migrants works to return to their work from holidays.\nUniversities, primary and middle schools and kindergartens across the country will postpone the opening of the spring semester until further notice.\nThe government is focussing efforts to prevent mass gatherings and mass travel to ensure the virus is not spread fast.\nBeijing has also launched temperature detection at 55 subway stations, including stops at railway stations and Beijing airport.

'888888,0,KIRKLAND, Wash. - Doug Briggs put on a surgical gown, blue gloves and a powered respirator with a hood. He headed into the hospital room to see his mother - to tell her goodbye.  \n Briggs took his phone, sealed in a Ziplock bag, into the hospital room and cued up his mother\'s favourite songs. He put it next to her ear and noticed her wiggle, ever so slightly, to the music.  \n "She knew I was there," Briggs recalled, smiling.  \n Between songs by Barbara Streisand and the Beatles, Briggs conference-called his aunts to let them speak to their sister one last time. "I love you, and I\'m sorry I\'m not there with you. I hope the medicine they\'re giving you is making you more comfortable," said Meri Dreyfuss, one of her sisters.  \n Somewhere between "Stand by Me" and "Here, There, and Everywhere," Barbara Dreyfuss passed away – her hand in her son\'s, clad in latex. It would be two days before doctors confirmed that she had succumbed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.  \n Dreyfuss, 75, was the eighth U.S. patient to die in a pandemic that has now killed more than 1,200 nationally and nearly 25,000 worldwide. She was among three dozen deaths linked to the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, the site of one of the first and deadliest U.S. outbreaks. (For interactive graphics tracking coronavirus in the United States and worldwide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0 and https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr )  \n Dreyfuss\'s final hours illustrate the heartrending choices now facing families who are forced to strike a balance between staying safe and comforting their sick or dying loved ones. Some have been cut off from all contact with parents or spouses who die in isolation, while others have strained to provide comfort or to say their final goodbyes through windows or over the phone.  \n Just three days before his mother died, Briggs had been making weekend plans with her. Now, in his grief, he found himself glued to news reports and frustrated by the mixed messages and slow response from local, state and federal officials.  \n "You find out all these things, of what they knew when," Briggs said.  \n Officials from Life Care Centers of America have said the facility responded the best it could to one of the worst crises ever to hit an eldercare facility, with many staffers stretched to the brink as others were sidelined with symptoms of the virus. As the first U.S. site hit with a major outbreak, the centre had few protocols for a response and little help from the outside amid national shortages of test kits and other supplies.  \n   \n \'NOT FEELING TOO GOOD\'  \n A flower child of the 1960\'s, Dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. After marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women\'s studies at Cal State Long Beach, where she marched for women\'s equality and abortion rights.  \n Furious over President Gerald Ford\'s pardoning of former president Richard Nixon in 1974, Dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to Ford. "Today is my son\'s 9th birthday," she wrote of a young Briggs. "I do not feel like celebrating."  \n By the time she arrived at the Life Care Center in May 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. Fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.  \n When her son visited on Feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favourites, including diet A&W root beer. She awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.  \n "Hi Doug," she said. "I\'m not feeling too good."  \n Still, Dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. The mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging China.  \n In hindsight, Briggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. His mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.  \n At the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.  \n   \n \'A TINY FOOTNOTE\'  \n Two days later, Briggs dropped by to see his mom. She felt congested, and staff were going to X-ray her lungs for fluid. Briggs, 54, still saw no red flags, and continued to discuss weekend plans with his mother.  \n "I hope we can finally watch that new Mr. Rogers movie," she told him, referring to the film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood.  \n Briggs hugged his mom before she was wheeled to the imaging room and drove for a quick meal. Soon after, he received a call from the nursing home. His mother was experiencing respiratory failure. She was on her way to the hospital. Doug rushed to nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. By then, she was unresponsive.  \n At the time, there were 59 U.S. cases of coronavirus, a number that has since soared to more than 85,000.  \n After hearing of her sister\'s sudden hospitalisation, Meri Dreyfuss remembered an earlier voicemail from Barbara: her distant voice, groaning for 30 seconds. When she had first heard it, she assumed Dreyfuss had called by accident, but now she realized her sister was in pain. "It haunts me that I didn\'t pick up the phone," she said.  \n Briggs spent close to 10 hours the next day in his mom\'s hospital room. He wore a medical mask and anxiously watched her vital signs – especially the line tracking her oxygen saturation.  \n On his way out the door, a doctor took him aside to say they were testing her for the coronavirus. He remembered the difficulty reconciling the outbreak taking place on television - far away, in China - with what was happening in his mother\'s hospital room.  \n In the Bay Area, Meri and Hillary Dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on Feb. 28 when Briggs telephoned. After the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.  \n "I realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn\'t see her," said the middle sister, Hillary. "And now, it seemed that we shouldn\'t be seeing Doug, either."  \n They cancelled their flights. On Saturday, Feb. 29, Briggs learned his mother\'s condition was deteriorating. Tough decisions loomed. Briggs and his aunts decided to prioritise making her comfortable over keeping her alive. Doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.  \n She died the next day.  \n Having emerged from a two-week quarantine, Briggs will soon retrieve his mother\'s cremated remains. The family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.  \n "All the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis," said Hillary Dreyfuss. "It\'s almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what\'s going on." REUTERS \n '

The spring session of the trade fair was due to begin on April 15.\nThe NPC gathering is crucial this year, as it is set to ratify China’s first-ever civil code, a key milestone in President Xi Jinping’s legal reform effort.\nThe NPC is also widely expected to discuss the months-long protests in Hong Kong, and to announce the annual economic growth target along with China’s defense budget.\nUnder China’s constitution, a full plenary session of the NPC must be held every year.\nChucheng Feng, a partner at Plenum, an independent research firm in Hong Kong, put the chance of a delay at just 10% because of the meeting’s political importance.\n“However, as the epidemic extends into February, the gathering of China’s entire political elite in a confined Great Hall of the People for over a week looks quite dangerous,” he said.\nChina’s legislative meeting happens around the same time as the meeting of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country’s top political consultative body, which has another over 2,100 members. Together, the gatherings are known as the “Two Sessions”.\nThe provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan have already postponed their provincial annual legislative meetings due to the outbreak.\n'

'888888,0,SHANGHAI (AFP) - The food market where China\'s deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed nine people and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals - severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat - setting the Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China\'s Internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game - 112 items in all. \n "Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door," said the price list for the vendor, "Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses". \n Dr Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from "wild animals at the seafood market" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licences, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected\n. \n The Beijing News published a photo on Tuesday showing the same vendor\'s now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying that trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries, where they are considered a delicacy - like the civet or some rats or bats - or for purported health benefits that are unproven by science. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Dr Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society\'s Health Programme. \n Dr Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n "Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts," he said. \n "It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases." \n Bats are thought to have spawned Sars, which in 2002 to 2003 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n Sars was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following Sars, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to Sars, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world.\n'

This paper is entitled "detection of coved-19 in children in early January 2020 in Wuhan, China". The study includes 366 hospitalized children (aged 16 and under) from January 7 to January 15, 2020. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tongji Hospital.\nAmong 366 children, the most common pathogens are influenza A virus (23 cases, 6.3%) and influenza B virus (20 cases, 5.5%). A novel coronavirus was detected in 1.6% of 6 patients. The onset date of novel coronavirus pneumonia between 6 and January 2, 2020 was between January 2, 2020 and January 8th, and the patients were hospitalized between January 7th and January 13th.\nAccording to novel coronavirus news network, the report showed that the infection of children in early stage of the outbreak of new coronavirus, causing moderate to severe respiratory diseases, was related to the admission of a ICU (intensive treatment unit) of a patient, but the source of infection was not yet determined. NEJM ICU reported. Neither the patients nor their families had direct contact with the South China seafood wholesale market or with each other. The results show that sars-cov-2 infection in children occurs early in the epidemic.\nThe news did not specify the time when the above-mentioned paper was submitted or published'

A new type of coronavirus disease (covid-19). This is the local information resource report of South China Sea King.\nAccording to his information, from Friday, tourists will be able to visit some famous places again, such as "ends of the earth" Park, Nanshan Park and wurizhou island. The task of the tourism facilities authority is to provide a high level of service under strict sanitary conditions. The staff of parks and other tourist facilities shall regularly disinfect the site and take all necessary preventive measures. In all tourist facilities, whether staff or vacationers, they must wear protective masks and have a temperature check at the entrance. Tourists are encouraged to stay away from each other for at least one meter.\nSince January 25, due to the eruption of the new canaverus volcano, all tourist attractions in and around the city of Sania have been closed. The authorities were forced to take these coercive measures to prevent the spread of the virus.\nAbout\nAt the end of December 2019, Wuhan City, China recorded the outbreak caused by the new coronavirus. The World Health Organization recognizes this as an international emergency and calls it a pandemic. Outside China, outbreaks have been found in 25 countries, including Russia. According to the latest data, the death toll in China is 2236, and about 1830 people have recovered. It is estimated that more than 150 million people were infected with HIV between 2000 and 2001.\nIn Hainan, there are 168 cases of coronavirus infection.\n'
'888888,0,Singapore, a tiny city-state of less than 6 million people, had one of the earliest and biggest clusters of cases of the coronavirus in early February, before it began its rapid, inexorable expansion around the globe.\nWithin weeks, the country\'s tally of infections with the highly contagious virus that causes COVID-19 was overtaken by skyrocketing caseloads in South Korea, several European countries and the U.S.\nSome strategies are proving more effective than others in containing the pandemic: pro-active efforts to track down and isolate the infected, access to basic, affordable public health care, and clear, reassuring messaging from leaders. East Asia\'s experience with the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China, has likewise helped.\nSince testing rates vary widely, it\'s hard to know for sure. But Singapore appears to be among the handful of places that tick all those boxes, though recent spikes in new cases show that any lapses can have dire consequences.\nSingapore\'s first case, confirmed on Jan. 23, was a 66-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease was first detected in late December.\nBy mid-February, the number of recovered patients in the Southeast Asian city-state was outpacing new ones. That changed in early March after 47 cases were tracked to a Feb. 15 dinner gathering. As of Wednesday, Singapore had 266 confirmed cases and no deaths from the virus.\nAs new infections increased, the government tightened quarantine controls.\nTaiwan, a self-governed island off the coast of mainland China, has confirmed just 77 cases and one death. Most recent cases were residents returning from overseas travel.\nHong Kong has reported 167 cases and four deaths. Its leader, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday warned against all outbound travel and said any people arriving from outside greater China will face 14-day home quarantines or medical surveillance.\nOf the 13 cases found in the tiny gambling enclave of Macao, 10 have recovered. Casinos have been closed for weeks to battle the outbreak.\nCambodia, which has confirmed a dozen cases, last weekend moved to stop foreigners traveling from France, the U.S., Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran after several new cases were found among travelers.\nThailand, likewise, appears to have kept cases under control with aggressive public health campaigns intended to minimize infections, though new cases jumped recently as stepped-up testing found clusters linked to a boxing tournament and an evening gathering at a bar. So far, 177 cases have been confirmed among 70 million Thais, even though it\'s a top destination for travelers, especially from China.\nAssuming the numbers reported to the World Health Organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: Singapore, New Zealand, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia. Some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: Russia, Indonesia, Vietnam.\nFor Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the experience of battling the 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say.\n"Almost everyone played ball and followed accordingly," said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Singapore\'s Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. "SARS was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool."\nAfter the SARS outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in Singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. It set up "fever centers" to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, Leong said. So when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, Singapore was ready to act, he said.\nFrom Feb. 1, Singapore blocked entry and transit for new visitors who had traveled to mainland China within 14 days. These restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea.\nWhen the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in China surged, the government raised its alert to "orange," the second-highest level, on Feb. 7. The Singapore Air Show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from China from attending. Good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended.\nThe National Public Health Laboratory, set up after SARS, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed COVID-19 test kits.\nRapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and ATM records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former director of WHO\'s research policy and cooperation department.\nOnce a COVID-19 case is confirmed, Singapore embarks on "diligent contract tracing," said Pangestu. It ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. Worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. Schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess.\nSo far, 5,700 people have been quarantined.\nIn Thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said Thanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department of the Health Ministry. "We must go see them ourselves. This is an old public health way. We do our best," he said.\nIt has mostly worked. But newly confirmed clusters show one dinner, one boxing match or one religious gathering can undo weeks of work.\nInitially, Germany was thought to have done relatively well at slowing the spread, but infections there have jumped to 9,360.\nIn South Korea, where more than 270,000 people have been tested, newly discovered cases are dropping sharply, but clusters are still popping up, at a call center, at a church.\nThis week, Malaysia has reported a surge in cases linked to a religious gathering in its capital last week. Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia also have confirmed new cases linked to that gathering.\nIt\'s unclear if the strategies used in an authoritarian society like Singapore would work in bigger countries whose citizens expect greater personal freedoms: In March, a Chinese couple was charged under Singapore\'s Infectious Diseases Act for misinforming health officials and obstructing contact tracing. If convicted, they may be imprisoned or fined.\nBut as virus controls expand to unprecedented levels in many other countries, the policies are looking prescient.\nSingapore is a small island with strong public trust in the government, "a strong healthcare system, excellent information systems and plenty of money," said Pangestu. "Many other countries, especially developing ones, do not have these capacities or characteristics."\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, lauded for adopting a calming, clear approach early on, said in a televised talk last week that the situation was under control but the government was planning ahead, trying to free up hospital beds to be prepared for any surge in cases.\nSingaporeans "feel we are all in this together," Lee said, "and we don\'t leave anyone behind."\n'

'888888,0,Letters and parcels from China? Can be received without driving. Vaccines for pneumonia? Don\'t help with the new Coronavirus. Should I eat garlic? It\'s healthy, but there\'s no evidence that it\'s protecting it from the pathogen.\nThese questions and answers come from the World Health Organisation (WHO) website. Under a heading called myth busters, the WHO tries to fight myths. The United Nations authority is thus trying to counter the rumours about the new Coronavirus. Because rumors, misinformation and conspiracy theories spread faster than the virus itself.\nAt the end of 2019, a new virus broke out in China, 2019nCoV, closely related to the deadly Sars virus. Meanwhile, thousands of people have been infected, hundreds have died, and many countries have long reported cases. Because the pathogen was unknown last year and the consequences of the outbreak are not yet predictable, there is a great need for knowledge: Google Trends is showing a rapid increase in the corona virus in January. A demand that remains undiscovered: more than 15 million tweets about the Coronavirus have been posted on Twitter in the last four weeks, and new news and assessments are appearing daily in the media. There are so many contributions that the WHO writes about an information epidemic, an abundance of information, correct but also wrong.\nIn general, it is necessary to distinguish between uncertain information, news ripped out of context or false news and conspiracy theories. For example, the story of a couple of parents who allegedly left their two sick children at the airport is circulating online. There\'s no proof of that. Just like a video that spreads in alarmist tones alleged facts about the virus\nYeah. The claims in it are partly exaggerated, partly unfounded, partly incorrect, as the Correctiv portal has researched. But there are conspiracy theories. It is said that the outbreak was based on a plot by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. That\'s not true either.\nNow you may find this information harmless. In part, however, the false information circulating around the new Coronavirus is harmful, even life-threatening. About when they advertise supposed remedies or treatments. For example, the Indian Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Natural Medicine recommends homeopathic treatment of coronary lung disease. The effect of homeopathy beyond the placebo effect has not been demonstrated. And there\'s a rumor on Facebook that it cures a coronavirus infection by drinking a chemical solution called MMS. This is not only wrong, but even life-threatening when used. Facebook, usually not known for its intensive handling of false content, has now announced to remove corresponding posts from its platform. Twitter not only wants to delete misleading posts, but only to find credible information when searching for the Coronavirus, it says in a blog post.\nThe media dynamics that can be observed at the moment are not new. It resembles other news stories, whether terrorist attack or plane crash: first something bad happens, then information spreads in the social media in minutes, and finally media reports. People read posts or articles, look for more information, for certainty. But because there is still little certainty, there is room for rumors, false information and even conspiracy theories.\nYeah. The effect is reinforced by the fact that the level of knowledge around the centre of the news, in this case the corona virus disease, can constantly change and what seems certain today could be refuted tomorrow.\nNicole Kramer works as a professor of social psychology at the University of Duisburg-Essen and researches, among other things, on Fake News. She sees several reasons for spreading false and uncertain information: "There is still a lot of uncertainty about the Coronavirus," she says, "and because the outbreak is threatening to become a pandemic, and so everyone in Germany could eventually be in danger of getting infected, the need for information was particularly great. People sent information they see too quickly, Kramer says, often without having read the message accurately. Images with particularly frightening motives, such as pictures from overcrowded hospital halls, on which patients lie on the floor, fired this: "Some texts will certainly be passed on because the power of the images is so strong," says Kr am er. We are all responsible for spreading false information." It is less relevant who puts the wrong message into the world, but who disseminates it. And these are mostly people, not bots,"says Kramer.\nBut, of course, misinformation is not only unwittingly disseminated. There are also actors who purposefully disseminate the information, Kramer says. These could be laymen who simply want attention, but also state actors who want to create unrest.\nAdditionally, especially on health issues, much reliance is placed on the experience of others, communications scientist Markus Schafer of the University of Mainz told ZDF. Together with colleagues, he has investigated how Internet users learn about health\nYeah. According to this, almost every second respondent (46 percent) claims to be informed about health issues in personal conversations with family, friends and colleagues. 39 percent use the Internet, in the age group from 18 to 29 there were even 46 percent (journal for online consulting and computer-mediated communication: Shepherd et al., 2019). Only health issues are often very complex." That is why misinformation in this area spreads so well,"says Schafer. Medicine is not an exact science. In medical practice, scientific knowledge and experience come together. There is sometimes more room for rumours than for scientific questions.\nThe impact of such false information is not only problematic in the short term, but also in the long term. In psychology, one speaks of the misinformation effect: if one reads incorrect information directly after an event, it can lead to one noticing it, even if one should actually know that it is not true (for example Loftus, 2005)." This is normal in evolutionary psychology,"says social psychologist Kramer. At first we believed what we saw and did not immediately doubt everything. The problem was that misinformation would be as well received as facts. The wrong information could hardly be overwritten. Therefore, even if people have read a correction, they may remember the wrong information.\nIt becomes even more difficult when the false information you read fits into your own worldview. Because we all tend to believe what we want to believe. In psychology, it\'s called confirmation bias. In the case of the Coronavirus, this is good to observe: anyone who wants to believe that the world is in the midst of a pandemic will find and share information that suits them. If you want to believe the pathogen is harmless, find the opposite information\nYeah. It is still unclear how deadly the virus really is, and whether the outbreak will take on a global scale.\nSo how do you make sure that what you read is actually true?" Those who see a text online should not just share it, but read it all,"says social psychologist Kramer. It also helps to keep an eye on the sources. Is a contribution based on scientific knowledge? Can you check what\'s in there? Does anyone just quote from other media? What is the original source? Is there even one? This may sound trivial, but can effectively help identify misinformation. According to Kramer, the media, too, would be responsible for correcting reports if they originally contained false information.\nExperts are already calling for a global media strategy for future outbreaks of disease." We need effective media observers to monitor how outbreaks of disease are reported,"writes Ilona Kickbusch, professor of global health in Geneva, and Gabriel Leung, Dean of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, in a paper for the British Medical Journal. In the future, the WHO should not only contact social media, but also work with well-known fact-tellers. It is also possible to find out whether information would be withheld or whether critical journalists and journalists would be silenced.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires\nYeah. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person\nYeah. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nRead more about the outbreak of the new Coronavirus here.\n'

'888888,0,(Reuters) - A study looking at 10 Chinese children who were infected with the novel coronavirus has uncovered evidence that COVID-19, the respiratory disease it causes, can appear as a less-serious infection, illustrating how difficult the infection can be to detect based only on symptoms.\nThe study led by Chinese researchers, published on Friday in the journal Nature Medicine, found that one of the children showed no symptoms at all and the rest had mild symptoms.\nThe researchers also found that the virus itself can continue to appear in fecal samples long after nose and throat swabs no longer show evidence of an infection. Rectal swab testing may be a more effective way to determine how long to quarantine children, the researchers said.\nThe only reason the 10 children - six boys and four girls ranging in age from two months to 15 years - were tested at a hospital in the city of Guangzhou was because they were family members of COVID-19 patients or had close contact with people diagnosed with the disease, not because medical care had been sought for them, the researchers said.\nFive of the children had a cough, four had a sore throat, three had diarrhea and two had nasal congestion and runny nose, symptoms that the researchers said could can make COVID-19 look like other illnesses.\n“Mild and atypical presentations of the infection in children may make it difficult to detect,” according to the study, whose lead author was Dr. Yi Xu of Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center in Guangzhou.\nIn all, 745 children deemed as “highly suspected” of being infected were screened between Jan. 22 and Feb. 20. Of that group, 1.3% were found to be infected.\nThe low ratio follows the pattern described by researchers in another study published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine in which a separate team of Chinese doctors reporting out of the city of Wuhan found that only 1.6% of respiratory infections among hospitalized children were COVID-19. The outbreak emerged last December in Wuhan and the virus has since spread to various parts of the world.\nIn this latest study, seven of the 10 children had a fever, although it was never higher than 39 degrees C (102.2 F).\nNone had the pneumonia that has made the disease deadly in some adults, although CT scans showed that five of the 10 children had isolated or multiple patchy “ground-glass” patches, usually in the outer lung fields.\nThe headache, muscle aches, nausea, lethargy, labored breathing, vomiting and disorientation that can be seen in adults who have COVID-19 were all absent in this small group of infected children, the researchers said.\nThe researchers cautioned that although the virus was persistently found in the rectal swabs of eight of the 10 children even after it had vanished from nose and throat swabs, it was not clear if the virus particles present in the feces were infectious.\n'

'888888,0,According to the Central News Agency\'s report today, Xi Jinping stressed that he was personally responsible for the supreme responsibility of Wuhan pneumonia. After the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Chinese President Xi Jinping said publicly on the 28 day of the epidemic that he had been personally conducting and deploying himself in the prevention and control of pneumonia in Wuhan. Chinese national media CCTV App reported last night that when Chinese President Xi Jinping met with WHO (WHO) secretary general Tan Adhanom (Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus), he stressed that in the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic situation, "I have personally commanded and personally deployed".\nAccording to Xi Jinping, the Chinese people are fighting a serious struggle against the epidemic. The safety and health of the people are always the first priority. Epidemic prevention and control is the most important work at present. He also said that as long as we have firm confidence, work together in the same boat, make scientific prevention and control, and make precise measures, we will definitely overcome the epidemic.\nCentral News Agency said that after the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, Xi Jinping made the third public speech on the epidemic. At the beginning of the outbreak, even though confirmed or suspected cases have emerged in neighboring countries, China has no other reports except for Wuhan. It was not until January 20th that Xi Jinping first opened up the epidemic. He said that great importance must be attached to the epidemic situation, the large-scale and intensive flow of people during the Spring Festival and the prevention and control of the epidemic. Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels are required to "put people\'s life safety and physical health first", do a good job in prevention and control, timely release epidemic information, strengthen public opinion guidance, and resolutely maintain overall social stability. Since then, there has been a surge in the number of confirmed cases reported from all over the country.\nOn the 25 day, Xi Jinping held a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPC on the first day of the lunar new year. He admitted in the meeting that the epidemic was in a "serious situation of accelerating the spread. We must strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee" and announced the establishment of a leading group for epidemic work in the meeting. However, the leader of the CPC Central Committee to tackle the new type of coronavirus infection pneumonia leading group is not headed by Xi Jinping, but is Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council of China. This attracted comments from the outside world such as "throwing the pot" and "insufficient hierarchy".\nAccording to the report, when looking back at SARS in 2003, Wu Yi, then Vice Premier of the State Council, was the leader of the "national leading group for the prevention and control of SARS"\n。 In contrast, Li Keqiang served as the leader of the prime minister, and the level was not low; and Xi Jinping\'s "personal command and personal deployment" speech also seemed to emphasize that he had the highest power and responsibility in the epidemic prevention and control.\n'
'888888,0,SINGAPORE — A 45-year-old Singapore permanent resident (PR), who had travelled to China recently, lost his residency status for breaching his stay-home notice and has also been barred from re-entering Singapore. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), which did not name the man, said in a statement on Wednesday (Feb 26) that he was served with the stay-home notice when he arrived at Changi Airport on Feb 20 as he had travelled to China in the past 14 days. \n Although the man was briefed on the requirements of the notice, the ICA said he failed to respond to phone calls and was not at his declared place of residence when ICA officers conducted enforcement checks. \n The ICA added that its officers at the airport detected the man attempting to leave Singapore on Feb 23.\xa0 \n “He was warned that he had breached the requirements of his stay-home notice and could face penalties but he insisted on departing Singapore,” said the ICA. \n Due to the man’s wilful breach of his stay-home notice, the ICA said it was rejecting his application for the renewal of his re-entry permit which allows a person to retain his or her PR status while outside of Singapore.\xa0 \n This means that the man has lost his PR status and will be barred from re-entering Singapore, said the ICA.\xa0 \n The stay-home notice was implemented as a precautionary measure to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of Covid-19 and it was put into effect on Feb 18. \n Under this notice, all Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning from China are required to stay at home for 14 days.\xa0 \n The Ministry of Health (MOH) said in an earlier statement that those who flout the stay-home notice may face penalties and be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act. For instance, foreign workers may have their work pass privileges revoked and be repatriated, while employers may have their work pass privileges withdrawn. \n Students who flout the notice may face disciplinary action from their institutions, while PRs, long-term visit pass\xa0and dependant’s pass holders may have their re-entry permit and their respective passes revoked or validity shortened.\xa0 \n The announcement by the ICA follows a similar announcement by the MOH on Wednesday, which saw a married foreign couple being served charges under the Infectious Diseases Act for giving false information while under Covid-19 quarantine order. \n The couple will be charged in court on Friday. \n '
'888888,0,The death toll in China\'s novel coronavirus virus has gone up to nine with the confirmed infection cases sharply rising to 440, the health authorities said on Wednesday, warning that the disease could spread further in the ongoing Chinese holiday season during which millions travel at home and abroad.\n\nThe coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed people in China is a novel strain and not seen before.\nCommon symptoms of the novel coronavirus strain include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, according to the WHO.\nThe Chinese health authorities announced on Wednesday that 440 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) had been reported in 13 provincial-level regions in the country by the end of Tuesday.\nThe cases had resulted in nine deaths, all in central China\'s Hubei Province, Li Bin, deputy director of the National Health Commission told at a press conference in Beijing on Wednesday.\nAltogether 149 new confirmed cases were reported on Tuesday, Li added.\nLi said China was now at the "most critical stage" of prevention and control following confirmation that that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place.\nThe official said there was evidence that the disease was "mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract".\nOverseas, one case has been confirmed in Japan, three in Thailand, and one in Korea. The first case of the virus has now been reported in US with official confirmation that a person arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.\nThe patient was hospitalised on Sunday, after arriving in Seattle from Wuhan on January 15, officials at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said\n.\nLi said the figures from the commission show a total of 2,197 close contacts have been traced. A total of 1,394 are under medical observation while 765 people have been discharged.\nAll of the deaths were reported in central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared in the city of Wuhan.\nChina yet to confirm the exact source of the virus.\n"Though the transmission route of the virus is yet to be fully understood, there is a possibility of virus mutation and a risk of further spread of the epidemic," Li said.\nThe warning comes as millions of people across China are travelling within the country and abroad for the Lunar New Year week-long holiday.\nThe holiday season began on January 10 and would last for 40 days.\nOfficially, China will declare week-long holiday from January 24.\nThe Wuhan Health Commission said it would authorise medical institutions to quarantine all patients and people in close contact with them as a prevention and control measure, Li said.\nOn Tuesday, the National Health Commission upgraded the coronavirus to a Class B infectious disease, but said it would use the stricter control measures for a Class A disease to handle the outbreak, meaning any infection nationwide must be reported within two hours and monitored.\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization, which is holding an emergency meeting on Wednesday, will consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus -- as it did with swine flu and Ebola.\nSuch a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a coordinated international response in view of fears that millions of Chinese are travelling at home and abroad for the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival holidays starting from January 24.\nThe week-long festival triggers biggest mass migration, clogging road, rail and air networks every year.\nIndia has already issued a travel warning.\nSeveral countries started screening travellers coming from China, especially from Wuhan to detect symptoms like fever\n.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed on Monday about Chinese official\'s attendance at the emergency meeting of the International Health Regulation called by the WHO.\n'
'888888,0,(Reuters) - Threatened by a new virus outbreak, many Chinese have been turning to an online plague simulation game and a disaster movie called “The Flu” as part of coping mechanisms.\nThe new flu-like coronavirus has killed nine people and infected more than 400 in an outbreak originating from the central city of Wuhan, spreading fear of contagion globally and rattling financial markets.\n“Plague Inc.”, a strategy simulation app by UK-based Ndemic creations, was by Wednesday the top-paid game on the iOS operating system on China’s Apple Store. It allows users to create and evolve a pathogen to destroy the world.\n“The best way to conquer fear is to confront fear,” said one commentator on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.\n“Isn’t this actually joining the evil force if you cannot beat the evil force?” joked another.\nSouth Korean disaster flick “The Flu” was the most searched-for movie on Chinese media review and social networking site Douban on Wednesday. A documentary on the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak topped TV searches.\nFurthermore, 11 out of 14 top-ranked articles on content platform Toutiao were related to pneumonia, as were over half of the 50 most-read topics on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.\nThe virus outbreak has coincided with China’s Lunar New Year celebrations this weekend when millions travel at home and abroad for holidays and family reunions.\nBut the usual bonanza for the tourism and consumer industries may be hit as some people were cancelling trips and avoiding public areas like cinemas and shopping centers.\nBlockbuster movies set to premiere over the holiday have seen sales momentum waning. In Wuhan, moviegoers who had pre-paid were offered refunds, according to ticket-booking platforms Maoyan (1896.HK) and Taopiaopiao.\n“It’s understandable the virus could prevent people from coming to cinemas,” lamented one manager at a Beijing cinema, who asked not to be named\n.

'888888,0,(Reuters) - Another group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from the epicenter of China’s fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak were placed under quarantine at two military bases in California on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the disease rose to 12.\nThe travelers aboard two State Department-chartered cargo jets were met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening, and are to remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.\nFive of the passengers arrived exhibiting possible symptoms, two of them children, and were immediately hospitalized, along with the mother of one of the youngsters, the CDC said.\nThe latest evacuees, together with 195 Americans flown out of Wuhan, China, a week ago by the U.S. government, bring to 540 the number people subject so far to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years. Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\nThe two planes in Wednesday’s airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, arriving with 167 passenger. Of that group, three adults and a child “were determined to have a fever or a cough that warranted them being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,” the CDC said. The rest were placed under quarantine at two housing sites on base.\n“Because these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,” said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n“We are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,” Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\nHe stressed that the CDC’s strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n“If there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that’s not happening,” Braden said. “So right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.”\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and “doing well,” the state health agency said in a statement.\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said. Just two confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases were transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both between spouses.\nThe protocols in place at Travis and Miramar were previously instituted at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles, where the first group of Americans airlifted from Wuhan landed last Wednesday and are midway through their quarantine.\nThe CDC said the government expects to fly additional groups of Americans and their families from China to other U.S. military bases designated for quarantine in Texas and Nebraska.\nAs part of a U.S. public health emergency declared on Jan. 31 in response to the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently visited China.\nThe CDC also has ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited Wuhan or anywhere else in China’s Hubei Province during the past 14 days. Americans who traveled elsewhere in mainland China are subject to two weeks of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China will be directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers will be screened by the CDC.\nThe State Department also has issued a “Do Not Travel” advisory warning U.S. citizens against visits to China.\n'
'888888,0,\nLaver Cup organisers say the exhibition event will go ahead in September as planned despite the French Open moving to the same dates as the implications of the French Tennis Federation (FFT)\'s shock gambit began to reverberate on Wednesday.\nIn a move that stunned the tennis world, French Open organisers on Tuesday postponed the claycourt Grand Slam at Roland Garros from May until late September because of the coronavirus pandemic.The switch has placed the tournament a week after the US Open final and results in clashes with ATP tournaments in Metz, St. Petersburg, Chengdu, Sofia and Zhuhai as well as WTA events in Guangzhou, Seoul, Tokyo and Wuhan.It also clashes with the September 25-27 Laver Cup, an exhibition event co-created by Roger Federer which has always featured the Swiss great and one of Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic.Laver Cup organisers said they were surprised by the move to switch Roland Garros to September 20-October 4 due to the coronavirus."This announcement came as a surprise to us and our partners -- Tennis Australia, the USTA and the ATP. It raises many questions and we are assessing the situation," they said in a statement ."At this time, we want our fans, sponsors, broadcasters, staff, volunteers, players and the great city of Boston to know that we intend to hold Laver Cup 2020 as currently scheduled."The men\'s ATP Tour, women\'s WTA Tour and International Tennis Federation have yet to respond publicly to the move but players around the world have hit out at the lack of communication from the game\'s governing bodies.Canadian Vasek Pospisil, a member of the ATP\'s Players Council, slammed the FFT decision as "selfish" and "arrogant" while some women\'s tour players posted memes on social media to voice their ire.The United States Tennis Association (USTA) earlier released a statement which said there were no plans to alter the schedule for the August 25-September 13 US Open and went on to obliquely criticising unilateral changes to the Grand Slam calendar."At a time when the world is coming together, we recognize that such a decision should not be made unilaterally," it read."Therefore the USTA would only do so in full consultation with the other Grand Slam tournaments, the WTA and ATP, the ITF and our partners, including the Laver Cup."Wimbledon organisers said they are still proceeding on the basis that the grasscourt Grand Slam would start on June 29, while organisers of the Australian Open are continuing to work towards the usual January start for the 2021 edition.Organisers of the Korea Open said they had yet to hear from the WTA about the implications of the French Open move on their tournament, which was scheduled to take place in Seoul from September 21-27."We are still in talks of adjusting the Korea Open tour schedule, but nothing has been decided yet," an official told Reuters. "The schedule would probably change according to amendments in WTA calendar."The China Open in Beijing and Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo did not have any clarity on their events."China Open has not received any notice of schedule adjustment from WTA and ATP, and is currently preparing for the event according to the original schedule," a tournament official said.The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 190,000 and killed more than 7,500 people worldwide.The ATP Tour have announced a six-week suspension, the WTA Tour have cancelled events until May 2, and the ITF has called off all its events including next month\'s new-look Fed Cup finals in Budapest.\n'

Japan said separately on Friday it would step up testing and containment after reporting its first coronavirus death and confirming new cases, including a doctor and a taxi driver.\nJohn Coates said advice the IOC had received “externally” from the WHO was that “there is no case for any contingency plans of cancelling the Games or moving the Games.”\nThe spreading outbreak, whose epicentre is the Chinese city of Wuhan, has prompted the cancellation of some international sporting events, as well as 2020 Games qualifying competitions for boxing and badminton that were due to take place in China.\nCoates said coordination between the Japan organising committee’s virus task force and other national authorities reinforced the IOC’s confidence that the situation was being properly addressed.\nThat raised expectations that “we’ll be able to ensure that the Games go ahead in a way that’s safe for the athletes and spectators,” Coates told a news conference hosted together with Tokyo 2020 Olympics President Yoshiro Mori.\nMori echoed Coates’ reassurances.\nToshiro Muto, the CEO of the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, said in early February he was “seriously worried” that the virus might impact momentum towards the Games, but pledged the following day the event would go ahead as planned.\nThere have been more than 60,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in mainland China and nearly 450 in 24 other countries and territories, including 33 in Japan and another 218 on a cruise ship quarantined at a Japanese port.\nCoates said he was impressed with how China had been able to monitor its athletes “since day one”, and that most had been preparing for the Games overseas and would therefore not need to be quarantined on arrival in Japan.\n'

'888888,1,BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - Hundreds of people began disembarking a quarantined cruise ship off Japan on Wednesday as the death toll from the new coronavirus in mainland China passed 2,000 and the number of new cases in the country fell for a second straight day.\nAround 500 passengers were due to disembark the virus-hit Diamond Princess docked at Yokohama near Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK said, ending an ordeal that began when the ship was quarantined on Feb. 3 after a former passenger was diagnosed with the virus in Hong Kong.\nThere were also more promising signs out of China, where the National Health Commission reported the lowest daily rise in new infections since Jan. 29, or 1,749 new confirmed cases. Hubei province - the epicenter of the outbreak - reported the lowest number of new infections since Feb. 11.\nThe latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 and the total death toll to 2,004, three quarters of which have occurred in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan. Six people have died outside mainland China, including a new fatality announced on Wednesday in Hong Kong.\nThe biggest concentration of infections outside of China was aboard the Carnival Corp-owned Diamond Princess, with more than 540 people infected out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board when the quarantine was imposed.\nThe United States has already flown back over 300 American evacuees from the ship and other countries are queuing up to collect their citizens, including an Australian flight due to arrive in Japan later on Wednesday.\n“We were lucky. We booked a room with a balcony and a lounge area, but after being confined to this cabin – I am very keen to get off this ship,” Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters.\nOnly passengers who had tested negative for the virus and did not show symptoms during quarantine period would be allowed to leave the ship. Those who tested negative but were in cabins with infected people would remain on board for additional quarantine, Japanese officials said.\nJapanese officials defended the decision to quarantine the ship and test people on board.\n“Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital,” NHK quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as saying.\nOn top of steps already taken to isolate Hubei, where the flu-like virus originated late last year in a market illegally selling wildlife, state media reported the province was stepping up efforts to track down anyone with fever.\nThe province will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan. 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications at both brick-and-mortar and online drug stores, Xinhua reported.\nSeveral Chinese cities have declared that a shortage in blood supply for clinical use was imminent, state media reported on Tuesday, as travel curbs keep potential donors at home.\nChinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence that strict measures are working to bring the virus under control, but global health officials say it is too early to predict how the epidemic will play out.\nThe number of new cases in mainland China excluding Hubei has now fallen for 15 straight days. The number of new infections ex-Hubei totaled 56 on Feb. 18, down from a peak of 890 on Feb 3.\nThe head of a leading hospital in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to have succumbed to the disease, known as COVID-19.\nThe World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies program chief, Mike Ryan, said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday were monitored.\nRyan also said there were no indications the new coronavirus was infecting people in North Korea. Some South Korean media outlets have reported multiple cases and possible deaths in the secretive North.\nChina’s ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday the economic impact of the disease would be “limited, short-term and manageable”.\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020, despite some economic analysts downgrading their China forecasts.\nEven so, China’s economy was struggling, with many factories closed and others still not at full production after the extended New Year break, disrupting global supply chains and firms like U.S. tech giant Apple and major automakers.\nBritain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.\nData this week from Japan and Singapore indicated those economies are on the brink of recession, while South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his country’s economy is in an emergency situation.\nEconomists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.\nAnalysts at Nomura estimated 70% of workers who went home for holidays have yet to return to cities to work and that the business resumption rate was less than 40%.\nForeign pilots at some Chinese airlines have returned to their home countries and are considering other jobs after being placed on unpaid leave as demand falls, affected flight crew told Reuters.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said they have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.\nIf confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person.\nThe three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.\nA fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said.\nStill, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast.\nThey span nearly 900 miles from California’s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle.\n“What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide.\nEven as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission.\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nThe latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure.\nAround the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled.\nPresident Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged.\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease.\n“This is their new hoax,” Trump said at the event, held a day before the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\nThe U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections.\nA government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official.\nLatest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source.\nFauci warned lawmakers the country lacked enough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities.\n“Our goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,” CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters.\nA vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.\nThe United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak.\nU.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy.\nThe S&P 500 .SPX fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Stocks cut losses right at the end of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.4%.\nTrump this week said the coronavirus risk to Americans remained “very low,” but he has been increasingly alarmed by the reaction of the U.S. stock market, which he considers a barometer of the economy’s health.\n(GRAPHIC - Tracking the novel coronavirus: here)\n'

Among the 4,200 patients being treated in hospital, 1,203 were still in severe condition and another 336 in critical condition, the local health commission said.\nBy the end of Monday, 356 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, which has restricted the entry of foreigners into the city. Also a total of 25 confirmed cases were reported in Macao and 195 in Taiwan including two deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reporrted.\nAfter days of decline in coronavirus cases, China on Monday said that COVID-19 has effectively been "stemmed" in the country and it started easing severe restrictions imposed on Wuhan\'s 11 million people who were under lockdown since January 23.\nThe authorities began relaxing restrictions in Wuhan as it reported no new case for the fifth consecutive day on Monday.\nSignificantly, the Central Leading Group, headed by Premier Li Keqiang which is coordinating efforts to contain the virus since January 23, said the virus has been curtailed in the country as well as in Wuhan. "The meeting noted that the spread of the virus nationwide, particularly in the epicentre of Wuhan, has been effectively stemmed," an official statement said on Monday. The meeting, however, warned that the risks for sporadic infections and localised outbreaks have not gone away. With the pandemic rampaging across the world, the situation remains complex and challenging. "Wuhan city and Hubei province should stay focused on medical treatment and community-level containment as the two key priorities. They should continue to treat the severe cases, promptly admit new cases, and advance epidemiological investigations," the meeting said. In Wuhan, officials said people are allowed to go back to work while restrictions on the public transport are gradually being eased.\nThe Hubei province and its capital Wuhan with over 56 million people were under lockdown since January 23. The vicious virus broke out in city, reportedly at a live animal market in December last year and became virulent inflicting thousands of people in the city and province catching the government off guard. As the country saw a surge in imported infections, the Chinese government announced that all international flights scheduled to arrive in Beijing will be redirected to airports in 12 other Chinese cities from Monday. International passengers flying to Beijing will instead land at airports in 12 cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and Shenyang as their first points of entry, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement.

It plans to convert five more, and Madrid\'s hotel association has offered a total of 40 of its buildings to be used.\nThe city has also set up a field hospital in the Ifema trade fair complex, not far from the makeshift Ice Palace morgue.\nAs healthcare workers worked around the clock, they also struggled with scarce supplies.\n"All over the country, you see examples of workers inventing homemade suits using plastics," Olga Mediano, a lung specialist at a hospital in Guadalajara, a city east of Madrid, told The Associated Press.\n"The protective suits are fundamental because without health workers we won\'t be able to do anything."\nMore than 387,000 people worldwide have been infected by the new coronavirus and more than 16,700 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing.

'888888,0,Last Wednesday (Feb 19), Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat told Bloomberg TV in an interview that the Government has no plans to ease property cooling measures. \n “It is not on our radar at this point because we need to make sure that we stabilise the economy and we address long term structural issues,” he said.\xa0\xa0 \n This is understandable given that the Covid-19 outbreak has led to a percentage point downgrade in the official forecast of Singapore’s economic growth this year. \n At the same time, the outbreak will also have an adverse impact on the private residential market, with spillover effects on the entire real estate value chain and the longer-term stability of the property market.\xa0 \n Why is this so? \n Let’s take a look at where the market stands today as well as cooling measures such as the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD). \n Currently, developers now must build and sell all their units in a project within five years to get a remission of the ABSD on the land purchase price. \n Otherwise they will have to pay the 25 per cent ABSD, with interest. \n ABSD was 10 per cent when it was introduced in Dec 2011, before it was\xa0raised to 15 per cent in July 2013 and the current 25 per cent in July 2018. \n In 2020, developers are going to launch some 10,402 units from 48 projects, based on Cushman & Wakefield Research’s estimate. Of these, 4,765 units or 46 per cent will come from the luxury segment or the Core Central Region (CCR) segment. \n Traditionally, about 28 per cent of the buyers of CCR homes are permanent residents and foreigners from China, which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Singapore has since banned travellers who have visited mainland China recently, and the majority of that includes Chinese passport holders who could be the potential buyers of these luxury units. In 2019, non-PR China buyers bought a total of 359 units, of which 141 units were in the CCR. \n At a broader level, demand for private residential units might slow to a trickle soon, judging from the market reactions in our neighbouring countries affected by Covid-19. \n As an indication of how far sales could fall, China home sales plunged by 90 per cent in the first week of February compared to the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by China Merchants Securities Co.\xa0 \n Before the virus outbreak, the Singapore market was already expecting a more challenging sales environment in the coming months due to resistance to high prices and launch fatigue especially for smaller developments. The mood is now more bearish due to the virus outbreak. \n The temporary shortage of labour will also have an impact on the property market. \n Construction companies have expressed concerns about failing to meet deadlines due to workers from China not being able to return to Singapore and quarantine orders placed on affected workers in the industry. \n The authorities have urged developers not to penalise contractors and subcontractors for the unexpected delays. \n Beyond a temporary labour shortage, construction companies face a bigger and complex challenge arising from the global supply chain disruption caused by the lock-down in many China cities, with factories remaining shut or operating with reduced capacity. \n In Singapore, construction material and finished products are not expected to arrive in time for assembly or use. As manufacturers in China and the entire world are so interdependent, it is hard to predict how soon manufacturing would resume and at what capacity. \n What has made the situation more dire for Singapore construction firms is the mandatory adoption of the pre-fabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (PPVC) method at many Government Land Sales sites. \n Modern construction technology such as PPVC requires all components to be assembled off-site before they are delivered to the project site under construction. These include door, glass panels, tiles, sanitary ware etc. It does not allow construction to proceed if there is just one missing item. \n Although the current supply chain disruption would likely impact all stages of construction, the impact on PPVC construction would be more pronounced. \n The construction delay and the ripple effect beyond the short to medium term could have serious repercussions on the already fragile residential market. \n In about two to three years’ time, the Singapore residential market could deal with a supply overhang arising from the enbloc boom between 2017 and 2018. \n At the same time, all developers are bound by a five-year ABSD remission deadline that is fast approaching amid slower sales. \n On the supply front, there are 49,173 uncompleted private residential units (excluding executive condominiums) with planning approval. \n Of this, 30,162 remain unsold. There are also an additional 4,575 private residential units that do not have planning approval yet. \n Based on the 9,912 units sold in 2019, it should take developers roughly about five years to clear the existing stock and narrowly escape the ABSD penalty, assuming sales momentum in 2019 can be maintained this year. \n Looking at how things are now, it is unlikely that developers will be able to sell their projects at the same pace as previously anticipated.\xa0 \n In short, they could be hit with a double whammy – construction delays and potentially missing the ABSD deadline due to unforeseen circumstances which are no fault of theirs. \n Developers could slash prices drastically to try to move units but this could have a destabilising effect on the market as a whole. \n It is still fairly early days and how long the outbreak will last and how exactly it will affect the broader economy and the property market is still unclear.\xa0 \n But if the outbreak worsens, there is a case to be made for the authorities to extend the current ABSD deadline. \n The point is not only to provide much needed relief for developers, but to cushion the impact on the property sector. \n As it is, the current ABSD rule is too blunt a tool, as it does not differentiate the larger projects of hundreds or even thousands of units, from the smaller ones. \n As the economy is expected to head south, the larger projects have a much higher chance of missing the deadline, as they typically require a much longer time to sell out all the units especially during challenging times like now. \n An extension of the ABSD deadline would help developers to stagger new home sales and manage risks better arising from supply overhang. \n It would go a long way to help the market, long after the virus blows over, to avert a worst-case scenario that housing units are dumped in the open market in a disorderly manner, hurting both\xa0consumers and the economy. \n \xa0 \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Christine Li is head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia at global property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield. \n '

'888888,0,LONDON (Reuters) - Extending school and work closures at the coronavirus’ ground zero in China may delay a second wave of infections, researchers said on Thursday, urging the rest of the world to take note.\nWith containment measures largely successful and the epidemic’s epicenter now in Europe, China has loosened a two-month lockdown in the city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.\nBut a study in The Lancet Public Health journal suggested continuing Wuhan’s shutdowns until April would push a potential second wave of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. That would give health services more time to recover and expand, potentially saving lives.\n“The city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases,” said Kiesha Prem, a specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who co-led the research.\n“If they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.”\nThe study used mathematical modeling to simulate either extending or relaxing school and workplace closures in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people whose name has become synonymous with the coronavirus for much of the world.\nBy lifting control measures now, a second rush of infections may occur in late August, the analysis suggested. But keeping lockdown measures until April would likely delay a second peak until October — giving healthcare workers a chance to regroup.\nThose findings were “crucial for policy makers everywhere”, said Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London, who was not directly involved in the study.\nStunned by the disease’s rapid spread, governments around the world are trying to replicate China’s draconian lockdown measures while also working out the risk of recurrences once the epidemic peaks have passed in their countries.\n“Our results won’t look exactly the same in another country,” said Yang Liu, an LSHTM expert who also worked on the research. “But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection ... If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.”\nWorld Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday expressed the same view, saying lockdowns were the best way to curb transmission.\n“The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,” he said.\n'
"888888,0,NEW YORK — The number of cases and deaths in the coronavirus epidemic in China jumped sharply Thursday (Feb 13) as the authorities there changed how they keep track of the illness, and not, primarily, because of any change in the shape of the outbreak. \n There is still a lot of uncertainty about the true numbers — as with any new epidemic — and that will continue for the foreseeable future. Underscoring that point, hours after China revised its figures, the World Health Organization (WHO) put out a lower set, saying that for now, it would not change the way it counts. \n But experts say there were good reasons for changing the way patients with the illness, called Covid-19, were counted, and the new approach should catch many cases that had been missed before. That will allow more patients to get treatment and be quarantined faster. \n Here is a look at what we know — and what we don’t — about the new coronavirus numbers and what they say about the scope of the crisis. \n HOW DID THE NUMBERS CHANGE? \n For several days, the Chinese government had reported figures that suggested the spread of the epidemic was slowing, but that changed abruptly Thursday. \n Officials in Hubei, the Chinese province that is the epicenter of the outbreak, said there had been more than 48,000 cases there, a 44 per cent jump from the day before. They also reported 1,310 deaths, a 23 per cent increase. The trend continued Friday, though not as markedly, when Hubei officials disclosed another 4,800 cases and 116 more deaths. \n Previously, cases were counted only if patients tested positive for the new virus. Now, the figures appear to include anyone who has a CT scan of the lungs showing a telltale pattern of pneumonia. \n In the short run, the new accounting may deepen confusion about the true size of the epidemic. It also complicates efforts to track the growth of the illness over the last several weeks. \n “We need to be careful in interpreting these numbers,” Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO emergency responses chief, said Thursday. The larger number of cases, he said, “does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak.” \n The WHO then released its own figures, leaving out the diagnoses made without a positive test for the virus — and indicating that it did not fully understand the change China had made. \n “For consistency, we report here only the number of laboratory-confirmed cases,” the organisation said in a situation report. “WHO has formally requested additional information on the clinically diagnosed cases, in particular when these have occurred in the course of the outbreak and whether suspect cases were reclassified as clinically diagnosed cases.” \n The WHO reported almost 47,000 confirmed cases worldwide, fewer than 1 per cent outside mainland China. The Chinese figures put the total at more than 61,000 cases. \n WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE OLD WAY? \n In a word, plenty. \n Kits to test for the virus are not being produced quickly enough to keep up with demand, and they take days to produce results. Using CT scans means more patients can be checked, with the results available almost immediately. \n And the tests for the virus have not been very reliable. Many sick people have tested negative, only to test positive later. That appears to be, at least in part, because standard testing involves swabbing nasal passages and the throat, while the virus may be lodged in the lungs. \n In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shipped hundreds of testing kits to state laboratories — and days later revealed that some of them were faulty. It is not clear whether China has experienced similar problems in making the tests. \n SO ARE THE NEW NUMBERS DEFINITIVE? \n No. \n There are several ways cases might still be missed. Some people get sick, and die or recover, without ever seeing a doctor. CT scans allow doctors to identify people whose infections have caused pneumonia, which can be fatal, but the scans will not catch people with milder symptoms. \n There is another source of confusion about the numbers. It was reported this week that China is no longer counting as confirmed cases people who test positive for the virus yet show no symptoms. But some experts said they were not sure what had actually changed. \n The Chinese health authorities say they can distinguish, on a CT scan, pneumonia brought on by the coronavirus from some other serious lung epidemics. But it is not clear that they can tell it from pneumonia caused by other illnesses, like seasonal influenza; the accuracy may vary with the skill of the doctor reading the scan. \n WILL WE EVENTUALLY GET MORE ACCURATE FIGURES? \n Quite possibly. \n Right now, labs are testing for the virus, itself, and viruses can be hard to detect. What is often easier to identify is the immune system's own response. \n When a patient contracts an infection, the body produces antibodies to it — proteins in the blood that recognise a particular pathogen and trigger an immune system attack on it. Labs around the world are working to develop a test for antibodies to the new coronavirus, but none is available yet. \n It could be tricky. \n There are several strains of coronavirus in humans, including ones that cause common colds, Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). Antibodies to the new virus may be hard to distinguish from the antibodies people already have to other coronaviruses. \n In any case, it can take days or weeks before a patient tests positive for antibodies to a new infection, so the test may not be useful in diagnosing current illnesses. \n So while an effective antibody test may produce a fairly comprehensive picture of an outbreak, that picture will lag a bit behind the reality.

'888888,1,BEIJING — A new virus that has killed nine people, infected hundreds and already reached the United States could mutate and spread, China warned Wednesday (Jan 22), as authorities scrambled to contain the disease during the Lunar New Year travel season. \n The coronavirus has caused alarm for its similarity to Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, authorities cancelled large public events and urged visitors to stay away, telling residents not to leave the central Chinese city of 11 million people. \n The illness is mainly transmitted via the respiratory tract and there "is the possibility of viral mutation and further spread of the disease," National Health Commission vice minister Li Bin said at a news conference in Beijing. \n The World Health Organisation (WHO) will hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to determine whether to declare a rare global public health emergency over the disease, which has now been detected in the United States, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Macau. \n The Chinese government has classified the outbreak in the same category as the SARS epidemic, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the illness and the potential to implement quarantine measures. \n But they still have not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus, which has infected 440 people across the country. \n "We will step up research efforts to identify the source and transmission of the disease," Mr Li said, although he said experts believe "the cases are mostly linked to Wuhan." \n Plane passengers are facing screening measures at five US airports and a host of transport hubs across Asia. \n North Korea will ban foreign tourists entirely to protect itself against the virus, according to a major tour operator\n. \n VIRUS SOURCE \n A prominent expert from China\'s National Health Commission confirmed this week that the virus can be passed between people. \n However, animals are suspected to be the primary source of the outbreak, as a seafood market where live animals were sold in the Wuhan was identified as ground zero for the virus. \n "We already know that the disease originated from a market which conducted illegal transaction of wild animals," said Mr Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention.\xa0 \n "This might be the cause, so the disease could be on an animal, and then passed on from this animal to a human." \n He said it was clear "this virus is adapting and mutating." \n Countries have been intensifying efforts to stop the spread of the pathogen — known by its technical name\xa02019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) — as the number of cases jumped, raising concerns in the middle of a major Chinese holiday travel rush. \n This week, China celebrates the Lunar New Year, the most important event in the Chinese calendar, with hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country to celebrate with family. Many also venture abroad. \n CONTAINMENT \n On Wednesday, the commission announced measures to contain the disease, including sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains. \n People are being urged to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, open windows to allow in fresh air, and wear a mask if they have a cough. \n Anyone with a cough or fever should go to a hospital, Mr Li said. \n At Beijing\'s main international airport on Wednesday, the majority of people were wearing masks. \n In Wuhan, Mayor Zhou Xianwang urged residents not to leave the city and visitors to stay away if there is no reason for them to come. \n "If it\'s not necessary we suggest that people don\'t come to Wuhan," Mr Wang told state broadcaster CCTV\n. \n Police were conducting spot checks for live poultry or wild animals in vehicles leaving and entering the city, state media said. \n The local government has cancelled public activities during the holiday, including the annual prayer-giving at the city\'s Guiyan Temple — which attracted 700,000 tourists during last year\'s holiday. \n Tour groups heading out of the city have also been cancelled. \n Hong Kong and British scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in Wuhan may have been infected.

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — Amid expectations of a substantial package to help Singapore cope with the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat unveiled during this year’s Budget statement not one, but two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003, and significantly exceed analysts’ expectations. \n They comprise a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package which will “stabilise the economy and support our workers and enterprises”, as Mr Heng put it, and a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help households with cost of living. \n The special packages come on the back of lacklustre economic growth last year — 0.7 per cent, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis. \n On Monday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its economic growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. \n In his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, noted that Covid-19 hit Singapore “just as the global economy was beginning to recover”. \n “The outbreak will certainly impact our economy,” said Mr Heng, adding that this is especially so since Singapore’s economy is now much more integrated with the economy of China, where the virus originated.\xa0 \n The Government is monitoring the situation and it is ready to do more if necessary\xa0to help Singaporeans cope with the economic impact, Mr Heng reiterated.\xa0 \n Comprising broad-based measures, the two packages will also feature targeted support, with the less well-off and industries more impacted by the outbreak getting more help. \n \xa0 \n  \n BROAD-BASED HELP FOR FIRMS, WORKERS  \n JOBS SUPPORT SCHEME  \n Under the Stabilisation and Support Package, a S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme will be rolled out to benefit all enterprises and their local employees which total more than 1.9 million people. The Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of these workers, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600 for three months, said Mr Heng. \n This scheme will help businesses retain Singapore workers and will be given to employers by the end of July. The measures are directed toward Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, as well as both full-time and part-time hires. \n ENHANCED WAGE CREDIT SCHEME \n The Wage Credit Scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to S$4,000. \n The cap will be raised to S$5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. The Government will also co-fund five percentage points more, raising the levels to 20 per cent for wage raises in 2019 and 15 per cent for those in 2020. \n The enhancement will cost the Government another S$1.1 billion, benefitting 90,000 enterprises and more than 700,000 Singaporean employees, Mr Heng said. \n OTHER INITIATIVES  \n A corporate income tax rebate at the rate of 25 per cent of tax payable, capped at S$15,000 per firm, will also help all tax-paying companies in Singapore. This will cost the Government S$400 million. \n “We will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed properties,” said Mr Heng. \n Tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Singapore Land Authority, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation will receive help with rent, including more flexible rental payments. \n Firms can apply to the relevant agencies which will assess each request individually. \n Several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will also be enhanced for one year, such as allowing a faster write-down of investments in plant and machinery, renovation, and refurbishment under the 2021 year of assessment. \n “This will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises. For example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the rebound,” said Mr Heng. \n To help enterprises access working capital more easily, the working capital loan component under the Enterprise Financing Scheme will be boosted for one year, with the maximum loan quantum doubled to S$600,000. \n The Government will also bear greater risks for these loans, with its share of risk upped to 80 per cent from the current range of 50 to 70 per cent. \n “With the large part of the risk taken up by the Government, I trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support our viable SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises),” said Mr Heng. \n TARGETED HELP FOR SECTORS DIRECTLY HIT BY OUTBREAK  \n Additional help will be given to sectors directly affected by the outbreak — tourism, aviation, food services and retail, as well as point-to-point transport sectors. \n These sectors will be given help to retain and reskill workers. The funding period for reskilling workers through redeployment programmes under the Manpower Ministry’s Adapt and Grow initiative will be increased to a maximum of six months. \n Said Mr Heng: “Together with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. These workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling to prepare for the recovery.” \n For the tourism sector, a property tax rebate of 30 per cent will be granted this year to accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, as well as venues for Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions). \n International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15 per cent property tax rebate, while integrated resorts will get a 10 per cent tax rebate. \n A temporary bridging loan programme for the tourism sector will also be rolled out for a year, with a loan quantum of up to S$1 million and interest rates capped at 5 per cent. The Government will also bear 80 per cent of the risk of the loan. \n The aviation sector will benefit from a range of measures, including a 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport, as well as rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance for ground handling agents and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport. \n A Transport Ministry spokesperson said that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on Singapore’s aviation industry has been significant, with more than 80 per cent of all scheduled flights between Singapore and mainland China cancelled. \n “There are now fewer than 80 services per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. Passenger traffic has dropped,” said the spokesperson, who added that traffic to Singapore from other regions has also started to decline. \n Food services and retail businesses will also receive rental waivers or rebates. Tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets will get a full-month of rent waived, and other Government agencies such as HDB will provide a half-month rent waiver to their commercial tenants. \n Those that operate out of private properties will also not be left out — landlords will be granted a 15 per cent property tax rebate for commercial properties that qualify. \n “I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,” Mr Heng said. \n For the point-to-point transport sector, which include taxi operators and private hire car firms, Mr Heng noted that the Transport Ministry had recently announced a support package for these businesses. Many firms in this sector have come forward to support the initiative by matching the Government’s contribution, he added. \n Said Mr Heng: “This spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.” \n More details of the various measures will be revealed in the upcoming debates into the respective ministries’ budgets. \n Mr Heng added that he will elaborate on the S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package in the later part of his speech. \n S$800M BOOST FOR FRONTLINE AGENCIES \n Separately, apart from the two special packages, another S$800 million will be injected to support the frontline agencies dealing with the outbreak. The bulk of the amount will be channelled to the Ministry of Health. \n “This is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health,” said Mr Heng, who then thanked all frontline officers who have been working tirelessly to fight against the outbreak — prompting other members of the House to thump\xa0their armrests in support.\xa0 \n Paying tribute to the group, he said: “You exemplify the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. But please take care of yourselves. I am confident that together, we will stay strong and get through these trying times.” \n '

'888888,0,MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Robust iron ore prices drove BHP Group to its best result in five years, still slightly off estimates, with the miner saying containment this quarter of a coronavirus that is spreading around the globe should limit any economic impact.\nBHP’s underlying profit from continuing operations rose to $5.19 billion for the six months ended Dec. 31 from $4.03 billion a year earlier, the strongest result since the same period of 2015, lifted by lofty iron ore prices after last year’s supply disruption out of Brazil and solid Chinese demand.\nThe results were below estimates of a profit of $5.28 billion, according to analysts polled by research firm Vuma Financial. An interim dividend of 65 cents, 10 cents higher than last year, undershot forecasts for a dividend of 71 cents.\nThe dividend came in “below market as board takes conservative approach given coronavirus (63% pay-out vs 70% 3-yr average),” UBS said in a note.\nBHP has not yet seen a major impact on its business from the coronavirus that was discovered in China at the end of last year, and customers have kept paying for their orders, the miner’s new chief executive, Mike Henry, said on Tuesday.\nHe added, though, that other supply disruptions have lent support to iron ore.\n“We are moving all of our product. Demand remains pretty resilient. Prices have held up in part because of some other supply side disruptions,” Henry said.\nRio Tinto downgraded its forecast for iron ore shipments for the year on Monday after a cyclone off the coast of Western Australia earlier this month.\nBHP is the first among its peers to report its earnings. Global miners are all expected to have cashed in on last year’s higher iron ore prices, with a further boost coming as China pumped more money into its economy to alleviate an economic slowdown. China’s iron ore imports were at their second-highest level ever in 2019, further boosting profits.\nThe world’s biggest miner is positioning itself well in a world that is decarbonising, Henry also said.\nBHP is seeking to raise its exposure to “future facing” commodities copper and nickel, through exploration and early stage acquisition, he said, adding that it would be open to selling its thermal coal assets if it can find a buyer at the right price given the deteriorating prospects for the market.\n“We need more copper and we need more nickel,” Henry told reporters as he pledged to meet “social value” commitments.\nBHP has also been using more renewable power, is assembling targets to scale back so-called “scope three” emissions - or the emissions of its customers - and is completing a review into industry associations that it funds to ensure they comply with its climate change goals.\nAs it seeks to improve efficiencies within the company, BHP will also look at restructuring its technological operations and making more staff permanent, Henry said.\nShares rose 0.9 percent on Tuesday to $A38.83 amid an uplift in the mining sector after Beijing stepped up stimulus to cushion the impact of the corona virus outbreak.\nFree cash flow for the miner came in at $3.7 billion, compared with $3.6 billion a year earlier.\n'
'888888,1,For the first time since the outbreak of the Coronavirus, a person outside China has died as a result of a new respiratory disease. Like the\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Sunday that\nPhilippines is a Chinese from Wuhan, where the Coronavirus first appeared in humans in December. Since then, it has spread to nearly thirty countries.\n"This is the first reported\nDeath outside China,"said WHO representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe in\nManila! He added, however, that it should be borne in mind that the man did not\nthe Philippines.\nThe deceased is a 44-year-old male on 25th. In January, the Philippine Ministry of Health announced that he had arrived at the hospital with fever, cough and sore throat. Later, the man was suffering from pneumonia. However, he was in stable condition and signs of recovery\nIt went on. Surprisingly, the\nhis condition in the last 24 hours then again\nHe died in a hospital in Manila.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected\nYeah.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than sars and also the virus flu\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nLike the Philippine\nHealth Minister Francisco Duque said the man had traveled to the country alongside a Chinese woman who had also tested positive for the virus. The woman rests\ncurrently in hospital from the infection.\nShortly before the death, the Philippine government had closed the country\'s border to all foreign immigrants from China. Other countries, including Australia and the USA, have imposed similar entry bans.\nIn the People\'s Republic, the number of infected and fatalities is increasing despite massive security measures. After\nAuthorities have so far reported that 304 patients have died from the virus in China. More than 14.300 people have been infected in the country. Nine cases are known in Germany. Spain also reported that a German tourist was infected by the Coronavirus\nYeah. A passenger on board a German military machine with which more than 100 Germans had returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Saturday is suspected of carrying the virus.\nWuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, is considered to be the center of the expansion and is under quarantine. It is currently believed that the virus of wild animals was transmitted to humans in a market. Because of the rapid spread of the virus, for the first time a city outside the province of Hubei has severely restricted the freedom of movement of its inhabitants. In the nine-million-inhabitant metropolis of Wenzhou on the east coast of China, only one person per household is allowed to go on the street every two days to buy the most necessary for life, local authorities said. The city also closed 46 motorway toll stations.\nThe Chinese government also called on the weekend to postpone weddings and to hold mourning parties in a small framework. Travel in China, however, increased again, because on Monday the New Year holidays extended due to the virus end.\n'
'888888,0,The World Health Organisation Emergency Committee (WHO) meets again today in Geneva, Switzerland, to decide whether the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China is declaring an international public health emergency.\nFormed by experts from several countries, including Chinese epidemiologists, the WHO Emergency Committee met on Wednesday without reaching a consensus on the matter and decided to meet again today.\nThe international public health emergency presupposes the adoption of preventive measures at world level and has been declared for the epidemics of H1N1 influenza in 2009 of the Zika virus in 2016, Ebola, which struck part of West Africa, from 2014 to 2016, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, from 2018, and polio in 2014.\nThe new coronavirus (virus family), which causes viral pneumonias, was detected in China in December and has already infected more than 400 people and caused death to at least 17.\nPortugal has already activated public health devices due to the coronavirus from China and has alerted St John\'s Hospital in Oporto, Curry Cabral and Stephania, in Lisbon, said on Wednesday to Director General for Health (DGS).\nIn Portugal, established protocols for gender situations have been activated, by reinforcing the Health Service 24 line, by means of number 8002424, and the medical support line, for screening and preventing people from filling the health centres and emergency rooms of hospitals in the event of possible contagion.\nGrace Freitas pointed out that "there are no suspicious cases in Portugal" of coronavirus infections, and there is no alarm situation, but as a precaution it is "paying more attention" to the seven cases exported outside China.\nIn addition to China, with the largest number of infections, several other Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand, and the United States have reported cases\nYeah.\nThe virus in question is transmitted between animals and passed on to humans, and there are already records of individual transmission to person, but still under not fully substantiated circumstances.\nThe first cases of the coronavirus "2019 --nCoV" appeared in the Chinese town of Whuan when people with viral pneumonia (lung infection caused by a virus) began to arrive at hospitals.\nIt was found that all people were often working or visiting Huanan\'s seafood and meat market in the same city.\nThe exact origin of the infection is still unknown, but it would have been contaminated animals, which are marketed alive, to transmit it to humans.\nER (ARA) // HB\nLusa/End\n'
'888888,0,\nFor the chair of the University of Michigan School of Public Health\'s biostatistics department and professor of biostatistics, epidemiology as well as global public health, the situation around her in the US looked pretty grim.\nAnd getting grimmer.\nHer parents were far away in Kolkata.\nThere was a travel ban in place.\n"I have been in this country since 1996. I came as a graduate student to do my PhD.\nIt has been about 24 years. I\'ve never felt this helpless -- that even if I want to, I cannot go back to India, if something happens to my parents."\nThe news out of India, which was not yet facing any significant number of coronavirus cases, looked unsettling.\nIndia seemed unprepared, not testing enough and not entirely willing to believe that the covid-19 tsunami was headed her way.\nDr Mukerjee knew, from looking at the stats, that each death conceals 1,000 additional maybe hidden cases.\nA few calls around made this Indian-origin epidemiologist realise that there were many like her in the "same boat" including some of her Indian graduate students.\nEveryone was worried sick about India and their folks and could not go back home.\nThat inspired them to get together and work on a special epidemiological report on the potential coronavirus situation for India.\n"I\'m a data scientist. I can only look at data. I cannot go to the front line and cure people. Or try to discover drugs. I can only try to unravel the patterns that are hidden in the data and help the public."\nWhen they started up their work, India was lagging behind other countries in Europe and America, in covid-19 cases, because India had less China connections, says Dr Mukherjee, and cases only began to trickle in after Thailand, Singapore and other Asian countries got infected.\nBut that did not mean, as per her and her team\'s calculations, India would escape without serious casualties.\n"It is amazing that when a team of people work, you can accomplish something really remarkable... One of my colleagues actually had built this (epidemiological covid-19 assessing) model for Hubei (China).\n"And he was continuously telling me that, you know, for China, I cannot do anything, because I cannot change policy because it was already been done. But for India use this model. It\'s really, actually very important right now."\nSo she collaborated with her colleague Professor Peter X K Song, and his student Lili Wang, using their modelling, package and software, and a team from the department of biostatistics, as well as biostatistics specialists, from other universities, to construct this report.\n"It all came together. In four days. I barely slept. My team barely slept. We really wanted to get the data out there. This gave (us) purpose. It was a very positive thing for us to do."\n\nOne the main conclusions of Dr Mukherjee\'s team\'s report was that India needed a man-made disruption of some sort to stop the burgeoning tide of covid-19 cases flowing across India.\nThat fortuitously happened on March 24 when Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi announced a three-week nation-wide lockdown.\nThe government could look at extending that date or modifying the nature of the clampdown after they, like Dr Mukherjee, figure out what is the "optimal period of lockdown."\n\nPlease click on the graphics and table for a full-screen resolution.\n\nWe thought there would be a huge impact (with) an intervention.\nOur calculations are really supported by what happened in two other countries -- that it was, actually, in two weeks, three weeks, were able to contain it.\nNow, whether this is going to go away.\nThat\'s another question.\nRight.\nThat\'s the pivotal question.\nIs this just a matter of three weeks?\nWe have to be really cautious and really devise how the absolute lockdown will naturally open.\nYou (India) may not need such draconian measures (beyond three weeks).\nI do think that you need long term support, economic support, and surveillance to contact chasing and large-scale testing, building healthcare capacity.\nThe lockdown is giving you time, and there\'s an exceptional value in time because if you can give the right treatment and treat people, then the mortality is not that high.\nBut if people do not get the right treatment then there are too many patients and too few beds and too few ventilators, then then the death rate is going to be very high.\nThe death rate in South Korea, because they could detect early and could contain the disease is about 0.1 per cent.\nIn China it has been three to four per cent, which is a huge difference.\nI do feel that slowing down the process is extremely critical.\nAnd that\'s why every epidemiologist, everyone has been talking about flattening the curve.\nIndia needs more, because it has one-fourth the number of hospital beds, maybe one-tenth the number of ICU beds and ventilators compared to the other countries that we are talking about.\n\n\nYeah, so it\'s 2.8 for 1,000.\nSo that\'s the World Bank number.\nThe UK is also 2.9.\nI was surprised with the numbers, honestly, but that\'s the World Bank data source.\nI don\'t have any other sources of data where I can verify across the different countries.\nYou know, I\'ll be honest with you, that when I first started looking at this data, I am not an infectious disease epidemiologist.\nI started looking at the data.\nAnd it is striking to me how similar the US numbers are to the numbers in Italy, at a lag of 11 days.\nThey are just almost like within one week of each other.\nI found that very fascinating: Why is the USA 11 days behind Italy?\nThen I plotted the Indian numbers, and they were exactly almost 11 to 13 days behind US numbers, right.\nThere is the pattern that was just fascinating to me as a mathematician, and when we looked at all the growth curves, the initial period is very slow, and that\'s exactly why it\'s deceptive.\nThere are lots of asymptotic cases and you are thinking that the cases are ten when there are hundreds of cases which are asymptotic, right?\nThat\'s why it creeped in very slowly and then exploded suddenly, that\'s what we call like the exponential growth.\nSo every curve is like an S shaped curve where it\'s very low, and then there\'s a boom, and then it plateaus.\nThis looks so predictable.\nThat\'s why I started modelling (a simple, mathematically-formalized way to estimate reality) it.\nBecause there is a lot that could be told, because the progress of contagion is somewhat mathematically defined.\n\n\nWhat I suspect -- and I didn\'t know because I really started looking at the data in India in depth -- and others probably I just looked at the patterns...\nWell, what are the intrinsic causes I do not know.\nBut what I read, I am about to tell you: In the initial period in Italy, the first few carriers were really super carriers.\nThey were asymptomatic and they were very active people and they went and infected many, many people.\nIf your initial carrier is like a very quiet person, does not interact, doesn\'t go to the gym, does not go to the restaurant, that could have a completely different impact.\nThat\'s very critical, because the first few people can infect hundreds of people...\nThat\'s what can change this -- the initial group (infected).\nAlso what I heard: My brother actually lives in Italy and he had done some wonderful pieces, that he wrote for a Bengali newspaper, that they were not following social quarantine,\nThey interpreted it in a very cavalier, European, way, and they were still going to bars.\nUntil there was a central lockdown.\nThey were showing their spirit which is what you want to do at this time.\nExactly.\nThe attitude: That this is not a big deal for my country.\nAnd then from there to central lockdown!\nIt has taken maybe a few days in many countries, so should we (India) make that mistake?\nSo that\'s exactly why this (lockdown).\nYou have country after country showing that is what works.\nThere is no reason to not call for this.\n\nSo you should look at Table II (below), where we actually tabulate how many million people are in the comorbid categories, that are have been already identified to be more vulnerable to the coronavirus.\nAmong them diabetes and hypertension really stands out and cancer too, because usually cancer patients, after going through chemotherapy, they have immunity compromised.\nThose numbers are worrisome.\nI calculated like 122 million people with diabetes.\nJust the sheer population, if you think that 20 per cent of the affected cases will have to be hospitalised and about 10 per cent will actually need a ventilator.\nBecause of the population of India if this really spreads and is not going to be localized, then it\'s going to be a disaster.\nThose are point estimates.\nSo in any statistical estimation there is no one answer.\nThere is a wide interval.\nSo in our first graph (Figure 1), you see the bars, which are the projections, and 59,000 is an estimate but the upper line is really 900,000 right?\nSimilarly, that 15,000 is sort of the best medium estimate, but there is uncertainty around it.\nThe main takeaway message is very clear.\nThat from millions and hundreds of thousands, you can come down to less than, like 50,000.\nWe are talking about a drastic drop in terms of the projected number of cases.\nThere is a small possibility, but as I told you, that India is not doing large-scale testing.\nAs far as deaths goes if there are nine deaths, then there are probably 9,000 or 7,000 to 10,000 cases in the community, according to the calculations.\nYou are not getting them (to these cases).\nYou are not chasing them.\n(If you do then) I think this is still containable.\nBut if we don\'t do testing, there will probably be asymptotic cases of quarantined people.\nYou will never get that exact count.\nSo this is based on how many people you test and the confirmed cases with the low level of testing in India.\nWe may never know the number of true cases because we are not doing large-scale testing.\n\nIMAGE: Table 2\n\n800 to 900 is the estimate, according to the other studies, behind each death.\nTesting capacities need to expand.\nI think this time, with the lockdown, should be devoted to expanding testing and treatment capacity, because you are sort of pushing behind the tidal wave.\nBut there will be a strong wave coming and you need to build your dam.\nThere are different components of the dam and building testing and treatment capacity (are two of the components).\nOkay, community transmission has not happened.\nI believe the government data.\n(But) what I would really like to recommend is to treat respiratory illness cases all across the country.\nTest some of those people.\nThe serious people are going to have serious respiratory illness and are going to be admitted to the hospital.\nYou can randomly test these people for covid-19 and see if anybody turns out to be positive.\nSo some kind of network of monitoring and surveillance.\nYou can do this in an intelligent way.\nIn villages test the people who have returned (from the cities).\nIn India, only 20 per cent people probably have private (health) insurance.\nIf you actually looked at insurance claims that also may show some spike, which could be predictors of something coming.\nI do think that the respiratory illness is a symptom, and you should randomly test those people.\nYou have to be intelligent if you don\'t have enough number of tests.\nYou don\'t have to test anybody, but you still have to be thoughtful in terms of what is going to be the surveillance strategy, in the meantime, as the central lockdown is going on.\n\n\nThis is an interesting question.\nWhat South Korea did is sort of maybe interesting here.\nWhat they did was really cluster testing.\nThat if one person was found to be showing symptoms, then they tested the whole community, maybe the whole apartment building or the entire (community) of the church (where the person went to).\nSome kind of surveillance with cluster testing will have to be in place.\nBut we also have to be prepared that some people are going to fall sick.\nFortunately, 80 per cent of the people do not need hospitalisation.\nTwenty per cent of these people are going to need hospitalisation.\nWe have to make sure they are treated so that their chance of survival is strong.\nFor that, two things we have to do -- we have to repurpose some of the existing facilities in terms of quarantine wards or hospitals.\nAnd then we have to protect our healthcare workers, so that they do not die.\nThey are the most vulnerable, as well.\nYou have seen so many unfortunate deaths in frontline health care workers in US and other countries.\nYou have to make sure that they have the protective gear, like gloves, gowns, masks.\nWe really have to put all our resources into thinking about surveillance and testing strategy.\nThis is my personal opinion.\nAs well as preparing to be caring for a number of people, who are going to fall sick inevitably, in the next few weeks.\nYeah, I do not know.\nI saw some numbers.\nI\'m not sure I believe them.\nEven in the United States, I\'ll be honest with you, that we got an e-mail from our health system to donate protective gear, if we have them saved in the house.\nSo even a country like United States is massively running out of these supplies.\nBut I think that India is (looking) at creative ways -- I heard.\nThis is a war.\nIt requires partnership between private organisation and the government and requires partnership between the government and the public.\nI really liked Prime Minister Modi\'s speech because he was appealing to the heart of the public (about) how critical this is.\nAnd if there is any chance of adherence and listening to him, then you need a public-government-industry partnership with scientists and experts, partnership with these different branches.\nBut what I also think that India will have its own creative ways of emerging out the crisis, for example, in West Bengal I heard that many of the stadiums are being converted into temporary quarantine wards.\nI heard that many people (among) students are making masks.\nWe have very big society.\nOur solution is not going to be the solution of the West.\nBut if we know what we want to achieve, then we can achieve the solution in a different way.\nWe have tremendous capacity.\nWe may want to take over some plants, clothing plants or fabric plants and just make masks.\nSuch choices I think India can do.\nPeople can help.\nWe have to be really, really mindful of what is coming and have a long-term strategy.\n\n\nWhat China did, we cannot do.\nChina had a lot of control on their public.\nThey mandated, I think, that one person can go out three times a week or something like that.\nSo they really chartered and rationed that.\nYeah, that\'s hard to say.\nAlso a function of whether they are going to expand the testing criteria right.\nThere could still be some cases where there are mild symptoms and whether they are going to become confirmed cases, or not, depends on who you are testing.\nHard to answer.\nBut according to our calculations, there will be a drastic drop with the lockdown.\nWith only social distancing and travel ban, there was going to be 48 cases per 100,000.\nThat means somewhere around 55,000 cases.\nBut with the lockdown that number came down to somewhere like you know, 15,000 to 20,000.\nIn context of India, in Table Four (please see), we project, that under surveillance that if there was 161 (cases), how it came down to 48, and then to four and then to one (with a combination of all three).\nI believe that these (methods) will be effective.\nI cannot and I don\'t dare to project the number.\nThe qualitative takeaway message is that this will reduce the numbers.\nThe exact numbers we do not know.\nBut without it, it is going to be much, much, much, much worse.\nIn the meantime, we really need to work on a sort of war footing, given that it is a natural disaster, provide relief, provide essentials, till we get biological herd immunity, we need to get economic immunity, and also social immunity.\nBecause these times are very hard for people in confined spaces and not being able to have their daily wages.\nThe government has to be really creative on how to make people adhere and not go astray with this ban, which is not an easy task.\nIt\'s quite a daunting task.\nThis is the hard situation right?\nYou\'re trying to optimise the control of the virus.\nThen there are other economic holes and detriments and social detriments that you are facing.\nBut I don\'t see a choice.\nI think what has been done is the right thing from a public point of view.\n\n\n\n'
'888888,1,This morning, the streets in Wuhan are little traffic. A blanket of pollution covering the sky, giving it a thick gray appearance. At ten o\'clock on Thursday, three o\'clock in mainland Spain, entered into force on veto announced on Wednesday by local authorities. From that moment until further notice, the 11 million people who are within the population can not leave it, nor anyone can enter, what makes this city of central China in a closed city. The Chinese government aims, thus halting the spread of the newly discovered coronavirus 2019-nCoV, which has made significant progress in recent days, both outside and within its borders. The most recent data place where 18 dead and about 634 infected.\nThis measure affects all flights, trains and buses, as well as subway service. Yunfei station, for example, have placed a grating in all accesses minus one. There, a security guard who prefers not to reveal his name said something before the ten o\'clock closing came into force, the number of people is much lower than that of a normal day. Confesses "eager to go home". The ban also affects intercity taxis, although the street is one, and Didi-one phone application similar to über- no drivers available. Highways have been cut, so private cars can not leave the city.\nThis blockage is one of the measures included in the protocol more serious action, whose launch announced Wednesday the State Council, although the scenario is listed as Level B infectious disease, the second highest. Another of the provisions referred to is the mobilization of the armed forces. A nearby town, Huanggang, located 70 kilometers from Wuhan, also will close public bus and train to the end of Thursday, according to the mayor announced. The authorities have also ordered the closure of entertainment venues in the city of 7.5 million inhabitants, such as cinemas and Internet cafes, and have asked people not to leave it except for special circumstances, reports Reuters. Do the same the smallest relatively Ezhou, of a population of one million residents.\nBefore the announcement of the siege in Wuhan, a lot of people I headed for the airport and railway stations in order to leave town before it came into force. One was Niki, a Taiwanese student of 22 who had come to Wuhan to visit a friend. Niki expressed the conviction that make it to time because it had found a particular driver willing to take her. "I\'ve come to the wrong place!" Goodbye as he ran down the street pushing his luggage. Wuhan Airport has been saturated with billing queues up to 100 meters, local media reported.\nWith this decision, the Government intends to isolate the population, the epicenter of the outbreak, which is particularly important given the proximity of the Chinese New Year. At this festival, which will take place next Saturday, followed a week of national holidays in which people usually visit relatives in other parts of the country or traveling abroad. Shifts can achieve these days the figure of 3,000 million, which is the largest human migration in the world. Wuhan, home to 11 million people -more than London or New York, is also a knot in Chinese railway communications. And Thursday in an unusual contrast, the windows of many establishments in the city look the typical decorations of these dates despite being mostly empty.\nThey are met, therefore instructions Zhong Nanshan, a scientist who leads the team trying to break the coronavirus. "From the time when transmission between humans is proven [one end discarded until this week], quarantine should be the first priority," he declared at a press conference on Tuesday. Zhong, 84, is the largest Chinese eminence in infectious diseases and rose to fame in 2002 directing the Government\'s response to SARS. This epidemic also originated in China and killed 700 people worldwide after becoming a global crisis, it is marked in memory of the population. "Quarantine is the most effective measure because we have not developed a specific drug to deal with the coronavirus", sentenced the researcher.\nAnother requirements instituted by local authorities in Wuhan passes mandatory to use masks in public space. This object has become the first line of defense against the outbreak and nobody moves without it. In many supermarkets, on the other hand, perfectly supplied, the corresponding masks shelf is empty. "We have sold all, to those of the warehouse. Do not know when they bring more, "he noted a store clerk Street Qinghuang, five kilometers from the center, protected with it.\nBut with the increasing number of cases, hospitals seem not cope. The newspaper Beijing News reported that many of them are saturated with patients, some of whom make queues outside despite the cold temperatures. Transfusion rooms are also overcrowded, and many patients are crowded, connected to their droppers, in the hallway. "My father has a high fever and respiratory problems since last January 2. After several treatments did not work, the past 10 days the hospital informed us that they could not admit you because they had no free beds. We transferred to the Wuhan Xinhua hospital and could not serve there. His condition has worsened, and takes 12 days with high fever and each day has to walk to the health center to be given oxygen: no admission without examination, without quarantine, "he complained a user on Weibo social -Red similar to Twitter -.\nThe arrivals area of \u200b\u200bthe Wuhan airport was deserted at night on Wednesday. One of the last flights of the day just carrying two dozen passengers, all protected by the mask. One was Xian Pin, 28 and an employee of a financial firm, who was heading to the city because a professional commitment. "It is very important, if anything happen to have me not come. I chose to limit my trip to the maximum, so tomorrow I\'ll fly back home. I am very worried, "he noted. Before the imposition of the veto, most likely Pin Xian has not achieved its purpose. On the same plane, the stewardess Lian shared that flights have experienced a notable decline in the number of passengers. She herself is from Wuhan, but quoted a popular saying to illustrate your peace of mind, "Shi fu huo bushi, shi huo buguo duo", "a blessing not a curse, and a curse has no escape".\nJust outside the airport, where no exceptional security measures seen, the driver Wang Zheng complained: "I spent five hours standing in line, passengers do not come, so we do not move". His son, 13, is not going to school since last January 10 because classes have been suspended. Asked about the credibility given to official figures affected, he replied: "That\'s better not to talk". The government has threatened to punish anyone who contributes to spreading rumors and local or regional administrations maquillen reality.\nDespite his concern, he was optimistic Pin Xian. Not remember the SARS epidemic because it was "too small", but it is sure that this time will not be as severe. "China is now a powerful country and our leader Xi Jinping has addressed the people to ensure that our best minds are working on it. I trust that we will promptly to the virus under control. "'
"888888,0,As the Covid-19 pandemic runs its course and wreaks havoc worldwide, the numbers look bleak. Nearly 500,000 people have been infected, and more than 21,000 had died as of Thursday (March 26). \n The international system has reverted to every country for itself, as borders have gone up and globalisation has come down. The world as we knew it is unlikely to be the same, but regions as they were remain relevant. \n The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), as the region’s grouping, must face up to the crisis together or risk being torn apart by it. \n Having gone through the thick and thin of international affairs for more than 52 years, Asean's resilience is self-evident. \n Its first two decades were beset by ideological divisions between Indochina and the rest, but since then Asean has managed to make itself the centre of a broader Asian regionalism, playing an architectural role to promote regional peace and stability by setting up a host of cooperative vehicles and mechanisms —\xa0 from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 1989 to the East Asia Summit and Asean Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus more recently. \n But Asean has never faced anything like Covid-19. This is a fast-spreading public health crisis in a region with weak healthcare systems. Case numbers in Southeast Asia so far appear suspect with a lot of downside risks. \n Thailand's infections have surged past 1,000, while Malaysia's is approaching 1,800. A country of 270 million, Indonesia has reported fewer than 800 infections thus far. \n The Philippines, with its population of 110 million, also have reported well below 1,000, and only a handful of cases were reported in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. \n Mortality rates have remained under international benchmarks of 3-4 per cent, based on established numbers of infections. \n What is troubling for Asean is that these numbers likely stem from under-reporting, and will probably rise alarmingly in the weeks ahead. \n To Asean, as a region of 660 million with an aspiring economic community, the coronavirus is an existential danger. Based on known facts, figures and trends, it is not far-fetched to estimate that many millions of people across Asean will come down with the disease. \n Too many could perish in the process, as healthcare systems in less developed Asean countries, such as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, become overwhelmed. \n For Thailand, these three mainland Southeast Asian countries are particularly crucial, because the Thai economy relies on their migrant labourers. \n Asean has banked itself on its development potential and its geostrategic location straddling Northeast Asia, South Asia, and the Asia-Pacific, and Europe. \n It is the fastest-growing region in the world, with a growth trajectory of more than 5 per cent. \n Its internal market comprises relatively young demographics and rising middle classes with increasing purchasing power. \n Although domestic politics are contentious in almost all Asean countries, the region is devoid of cross-border conflict. \n What Asean aspires to be can come to naught if the Covid-19 pandemic is not contained. The disease is making its rounds in waves through countries, with potential reruns. \n The public health crisis is just the beginning, as its impact will spill over into the socio-economic realm —\xa0from social re-adjustments due to increased mental and physical isolation to economic recessions and possibly an outright depression, depending on how wide and deep the pandemic runs and how governments responses around the world respond to it. \n Compared to the devastating 1997-98 economic crisis in Southeast Asia, Covid-19 may actually be much worse. \n Back in the late 1990s, Southeast Asian economies, especially Thailand and Indonesia, could find a lender of last resort in the International Monetary Fund and turn to external demand for economic recovery. \n This time, the global market will not be ready and demand won't be enough to prop up Asean's growth and recovery. \n At the minimum, what Asean needs is transparency and coordination. Asean member states must come clean about their number of cases and roll out wider testing. \n Some Asean countries, such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, have imposed virtual lockdowns to slow the coronavirus' spread, but this should be considered for the entire region for a limited period. If not, Asean's pronouncements on health sector cooperation as part of the Asean Vision 2025 will be rendered moot. \n Singapore has led the way by biting the bullet early on and imposing travel restrictions and social distancing measures. In fact, its vigilant handling of the Covid-19 outbreak is being used as an example for other countries. \n Thailand and Malaysia, behind the curve until recently, are following suit. Vietnam, as Asean chair, also has tried to stay on top of the outbreak, having come up with and exported affordable Covid-19 test kits. \n Once Asean's more medically-equipped members manage to contain their outbreaks, they should start helping their other Asean neighbours, as the disparity and inequality between Asean's members are well-known. \n Covid can do a lot of damage across Southeast Asia, but unless Asean responds as a region, the pneumonia-like disease will keep circulating among its 10 members for much longer. \n While Asean has to treat Covid-19 as a regional challenge, the 10-member grouping also has to avoid being further divided by the geopolitics of the coronavirus. \n China appears to have seen the worst of the outbreak and is now extending assistance to other afflicted countries. To reciprocate Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's demonstration of friendship in early February, Beijing sent loads of medical supplies to Cambodia —\xa0 similar moves in the future may end up dividing Asean members. \n Asean thus must come to grips with three layers of challenges. First, each Asean member has to be strict about exposing and addressing Covid-19 cases within their borders. \n Then, the whole of Asean must respond to Covid-19 as a united region, through information sharing and effective policy coordination to prevent the disease from returning. \n And last but not least, Asean must find ways not to let external players use the outbreak to further divide Asean. \n Indeed, unless it is dealt with squarely and firmly, Covid-19 has the capacity to undo all of Asean's achievements.

"888888,1,Over 11 thousand infected and 259 dead, all in China. It is the latest in the outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that has already spread to 25 countries. More than 60 countries have already implemented containment measures, from requiring medical attestations to those landing flights from China to cancelling flights or closing schools, shops and services. The objective is to halt the spread of 2019-nCoV.\nOn Thursday the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the coronavirus as a public health emergency case of international interest. And even though the WHO has not recommended restricting travel, the number of airlines and countries that have suspended flights to China is constantly increasing. In Portugal, the contingency plan is activated. Firefighters, INEM and hospitals have received standards that should guide security procedures in suspicious cases.\nThe United States has declared a public health emergency and announced that flights from China are only allowed to land at seven American airports, where passenger control will be strengthened. The country also announced that from Sunday onwards foreign nationals who have been in the CHina in the last 14 days, incubation period of the virus will not enter the country. Americans who have not been through that territory for the past two weeks will also have to be quarantined.\nIran has cancelled all outward and return flights to China as a preventive measure against the outbreak of the new coronavirus. In a statement, the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation spokesman Reza Jafarzadeh also announced that measures will be taken, which he did not specify, to transport Iranian passengers in China. At the international airport in Tehran, a group of doctors controls all passengers arriving from the countries of East Asia or regions where cases of infection with the new coronavirus have already been confirmed.\nYeah. If passengers with symptoms are detected, they are transported to quarantine centres,\nMacao's in minimum service. Schools, public services, cultural areas and deportees are now closed, trade is stalled and the two maritime links between Macao and Hong Kong are suspended, and the rest of them are expected to be reduced indefinitely as well. As the Express had already advanced, Macao Correctional Services Directorate announced the suspension from Sunday and also indefinitely of visits to prisoners and institutionalized youth. Many companies have also chosen to temporarily shut down or advise their employees to work remotely.\nVietnam cancelled the issuance of visas to tourists from China who represented one third of the total visitors to the territory last year. The government also set up a crisis committee to combine virus containment strategies and suspended all air links with China. However, the country is concerned about the economic impact of the outbreak and, like Thailand and Singapore, already prepares measures to minimise the economic impact of the outbreak in sectors such as tourism or exports.\nThailand is already missing tourists from the Asian giant. On Friday the government approved a package of measures, including temporary tax cuts and low-interest credit facilitation to help the tourist sector. Singapore authorities have recognised that the coronavirus outbreak will harm tourism and the economy, but the country has already closed its borders to Chinese travellers or who have been in China in the last 14 days, with the exception of residents with permanent residence or nationality\nYeah.\nIn India, which has been evacuating citizens on Chinese territory, passengers travelling to China recently are being watched for the typical symptoms caused by the new coronavirus at at at least twenty Indian airports. The country's Ministry of Health has put together a virus screening plan and strengthened the responsiveness of laboratories empowered to analyse suspicious cases.\nSome companies with presence or commercial relations with Chinese territory are also taking measures to prevent the spread of the coronary Chinese virus, restricting the movements of their employees to the territory or temporarily closing their stores in the country. Google and others have already announced limiting travel to the country.\nAmazon's boss, Jeff Bezos, announced that only critical travel is allowed and that company professionals returning from coronavirus-affected regions will have to work from home for two weeks before returning to the company offices. Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Apple are following similar protocols, the latter has already announced the temporary closure of their stores in China.\n"
'888888,0,St. Petersburg, 5 February. /tass/ Since the outbreak of new pneumonia in China at the end of December 2019, the situation in Colorado 2019 ncov will not hinder the cooperation between Petersburg and China, According to mayor Alexander behrov.\n"On behalf of the government of St. Petersburg and all Petersburg people, I would like to extend my heartfelt sympathy and support to all family members who have died of coronavirus infection. >China is an old friend and reliable partner of St. Petersburg. We have actively developed our cooperation and made great achievements in economic, trade and humanitarian fields. I believe that nothing will affect the speed of our cooperation.

'888888,0,Preliminary medical tests on a Chinese couple among the 7.000 people held on a cruise ship in Italy this Thursday and who showed symptoms associated with the new coronavirus were negative, the Italian Ministry of Health reported. The same source pointed out, however, that it still awaits the final result of the analysis.\n"The first tests appeared to give negative results, but we are still waiting for the final result", he said, in statements to the news agency France-Presse (AFP), a source of the ministry. The same source of the Italian Ministry of Health was not able to specify when the final result of the analyses carried out on the Chinese couple suspected of contagion with the new coronavirus, which was initially detected in China, will be known.\nContacted by AFP, Spallanzani Hospital in Rome, a specialist infectious disease unit that performed the tests, clarified that "the technicians" of that hospital unit indicated that "it will be necessary 48 hours to get a definitive result".\nApproximately 7.000 people, passengers and crew were now being held on board a cruise ship at the port of Civitavecchia, a coastal city in the vicinity of Rome, and were prevented from landing due to suspected cases of contagion of the new coronavirus.\nDuring this Thursday afternoon, unconfirmed reports advanced that about one.100 passengers had since disembarked. The mayor of that coastal city vehemently opposed the landing of the people. I must protect the health of my fellow citizens. At the moment, only the luggage will be taken from the ship, not the passengers. We are still waiting for the results of the tests of Spallanzani Hospital,"said the mayor of Civitavecchia, Ernesto Tedesco\nYeah.\nThe new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first detected in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province (central China) at the end of the year. The latest review of the Chinese authorities reports 170 dead, all checked in China, and more than 7.700 infected people.\nIn addition to mainland China, cases of infection have been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States of America, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, Germany, France (the first European country to detect cases), Finland, India, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates.\nSeveral countries have launched plans in the last few days to withdraw their citizens who had expressed their willingness to leave Chinese territory. A group of 17 Portuguese, currently isolated and quarantined in Wuhan, is to be withdrawn on Friday, one of them said to the Lusa agency today. The plane, which will repatriate Portuguese and other European citizens since that city, left the airport in Beja this Thursday morning.\n'
'888888,0,(Repeats story published earlier on Tuesday)\nBy Yawen Chen and Cate Cadell\nBEIJING, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n“My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don’t get any new answers,” Zhang told Reuters. “Every time the responses are the same: ‘There’s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what’s going on.’ The doctors are all very frustrated too.”\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travellers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan’s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters\n. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being “rumour spreaders.”\n“The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,” a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalised. “I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.”\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some “loopholes” in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognised that “all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.” But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n“In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I’m authorized,” he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested\n.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, “You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. “We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,” he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n“We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,” he told Reuters. “Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.”\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China’s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people\n.\n“The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus’s genome, building new hospitals at a moment’s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,” said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan’s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is “impossible to conduct the test right away,” an official at the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n“Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn’t be able to be treated,” the worker told Reuters. “The actual deaths were higher.”\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker’s account\n. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu’s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city’s health authorities.\n“All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,” said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. “At least if it’s confirmed we have a direction. If there’s no direction, there’s no hope.”\n'

'888888,0,Usuarios de Facebook han estado compartiendo publicaciones que aseguran que las redes 5G, no el coronavirus, están enfermando a las personas.\nLas publicaciones incluyen una lista de otras afirmaciones que niegan la realidad del virus y mencionan varios argumentos de tipo conspirativo sobre el virus.\nEl brote de coronavirus comenzó en diciembre de 2019 en Wuhan, China. Los Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades dicen en su sitio en Internet que el virus está ligado a un "mercado de mariscos y animales vivos" donde los humanos podrían haber contraído el virus de un animal. El virus luego se propagó persona a persona.(  here  )\nLos síntomas de la enfermedad COVID-19 incluyen fiebre, cansancio, tos y dificultades para respirar que pueden aparecer entre dos a 14 días después de la exposición al virus(  here  ). La propagación del coronavirus se da persona a persona.(  here  )\nLos teléfonos móviles usan ondas de radio. Ellos envían y reciben campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia (CEM RF). El 5G utiliza una "tecnología de conformación de haces", que permite que los campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia vayan directamente donde se necesita (  here  ).\nLa Comisión Internacional sobre Protección Frente a Radiaciones No Ionizantes (ICNIRP, por su sigla en inglés) publicó en 2020 normas para limitar la exposición a campos electromagnéticos, después de siete años de investigación. Ellas incluyen información sobre las redes 5G.\nLa comisión dice que el principal efecto que los campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia tienen en el cuerpo humano es una mayor temperatura del tejido expuesto. El cuerpo puede manejar pequeños aumentos de la temperatura corporal, como durante el ejercicio, pero la exposición a radiofrecuencia y la mayor temperatura pueden ser peligrosas sobre cierto umbral (  here  ).\nSegún la ICNIRP, "otra característica general de los CEM RF es que mientras mayor sea la frecuencia, menor es la profundidad de penetración de los EMFs en el cuerpo. Como las tecnologías 5G puede utilizar mayores frecuencias de CEM (>24 GHz) además de las usadas actualmente (<4 GHz), el poder de esas mayores frecuencias será absorbido principalmente a un nivel más superficial que el de las tecnologías de telecomunicaciones previas (...) Por ende, la exposición al 5G no causará ningún daño siempre y cuando se adhiera a las normas de la ICNIRP (2020)" (  here  ).\nEric van Rongen, presidente de ICNIRP, dijo en un video que no hay evidencia de que los campos electromagnéticos causen efectos en la salud como el cáncer, la electrohipersensibilidad, la infertilidad o alguna otra cosa. Los únicos dos efectos reconocidos en la salud son la estimulación nerviosa sobre los 10 MHz y el calor desde los 100 kHz (  here  ).\nLa Organización Mundial de la Salud dice que ninguna investigación ha asociado la exposición a la tecnología inalámbrica con efectos negativos para la salud (  here  ). La OMS afirma en su sitio en Internet que seguirá revisando investigaciones en esta área y realizando "evaluaciones al riesgo para la salud" de todos los rangos de radiofrecuencia que estarán disponibles en 2022.\nMarvin C. Ziskin, profesor emérito de Radiología y Física Médica, dijo que no hay fundamentos para esperar que la red 5G provoque condiciones adversas de salud, siempre y cuando se respeten los límites de exposición.\nZiskin dijo a Reuters, “El peso de la evidencia científica indica que las emisiones 5G no son acumulativas. Eso significa que múltiples exposiciones inocuas no se suman para producir un efecto biológico adverso. Agregaría que no ha habido advertencias de agencias sanitarias sobre posibles riesgos a la salud de la energía de RF, incluidas ondas milimétricas a los niveles de exposición que un consumidor promedio experimentaría de la tecnología de comunicaciones. Esto es consistente con la evaluación del tema realizada por grupos que establecen estándares como el IEEE y el ICNIRP”, refiriéndose al Instituto de Ingeniería Eléctrica y Electrónica.\nLos síntomas del coronavirus se pueden hallar en detalle en sitios oficiales de gobiernos y de organizaciones sanitarias internacionales.

Similar restrictions were soon introduced in other areas in Hubei.\nLocal officials announced plans to gradually ease the severe measures as the virus cases dropped dramatically in recent days.\nHubei, however saw seven new deaths on Monday, all of which were in Wuhan, bringing the total number of deaths in the province to 3,160.\nThe province still has 4,200 patients being treated in hospitals of which 1,203 were still in severe condition and another 336 in critical condition, according to China\'s National Health Commission.\nHubei has so far reported a total of 67,801 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including 50,006 in Wuhan reflecting on the intensity with which the vicious virus, reportedly emerged from a local live animal market in the city shook the province.\nOn Tuesday, the NHC reported 78 new confirmed cases, including 74 imported infections taking their total to 427.\nThe overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland has reached 81,171 by the end of Monday. This included 3,277 people who died of the disease, 4,735 patients who were still being treated and 73,159 patients discharged after recovery, the NHC said on Tuesday.\nWhile the gradual opening of Hubei province will enable its over 56 million to emerge out of the strict lockdown which also effectively shielded the grim stories of their suffering, there are apprehensions highlighted in the Chinese official media about how they will be received in the rest of the country considering the stigmatisation of the areas with Covid-19 and its deadly nature of transmission.\nAs the virus emerged in Wuhan, several foreign countries, including India, has evacuated their nationals and subjected them to stringent quarantine procedures to ensure the virus is not spread back home.\nAlso as China appeared eager to reopen the country starting factories and business to make up for the lost time, Chinese experts warned of a possible second wave of the Covid-19 virus attack.\nThe total number of imported cases of the virus reached 427 on Tuesday as a large number of overseas Chinese especially in countries like Italy which have now emerged as the new Covid-19 epicentres arrived back home.\nLoopholes in screening processes at customs and inadequate quarantine measures upon entry into the Chinese cities as well as a high proportion of asymptomatic cases are making the second wave of novel coronavirus outbreak highly likely, even inevitable, as the global pandemic continues to worsen, state-run Global Times reported on Tuesday.\nAlthough a drop in new cases is reported on a daily basis, all new cases now are imported infections, sparking serious concerns over a looming second outbreak in China, it said.\nChina\'s epidemiologist Li Lanjuan told media here on Monday that China still faces a severe situation currently due to the surge in imported cases from other countries and regions.\n"China is already facing the risk of a second outbreak as the number of imported cases already reached a small peak," Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the Global Times.\nHowever, various Chinese medical experts believed that a second outbreak is unlikely, considering the country\'s stringent measures and experiences during the past two months in combating the disease.\n'
'888888,0,On Sunday morning there is a plane with around 20 German returnees from the\nChinese city Wuhan landed at Berlin airport Tegel. They were together with 200 British and others\nCitizens previously arrived at a British military airport near Oxford.\nThe\nAccording to Berlin Health Senator Dilek Kalayci (SPD) they were first boarded at the military part of the airport\nexamined by an official physician and tested for the corona virus. You will spend two weeks in an isolation area of DRK clinics in\nAccommodation in Berlin-Copenhagen. The results of the tests\nshould be available by Monday afternoon.\nAlready a week ago, about a hundred German citizens and their family members had flown to Frankfurt am Main by a German army machine. Two of them tested positive for the virus.\nThe number of deaths caused by the new Coronavirus, meanwhile, has exceeded that of the Sars pandemic 17 years ago. China\'s health department reported new deaths on Sunday morning 89. So far, 811 people have been killed by lung disease worldwide. Due to Sars respiratory disease, 2002/2003 worldwide 774 patients had died.\nAir China announced on Sunday night that it would "adapt" its connections between China and the USA due to the Coronavirus epidemic. The website of the company can be seen that numerous flights between Beijing and Washington as well as to other American cities up to 28. were deleted in March. However, some of the connections between Beijing and Los Angeles, as well as San Francisco and New York, continue to operate the airline.\nThe number of confirmed infections in China recently increased to approximately 37.200. Outside the People\'s Republic there are more than 270 other cases in more than two dozen countries, of which 14 diseases in Germany\nYeah.\nChina plans to fight the epidemic\nconverted into almost ten billion euros. Amongst other things, the money is intended to ensure that:\nthat all Chinese take a virus test and treatment\nThe Ministry of Finance informed us. It should also be avoided that financial\nLimits the use to contain Corona in the individual\nRegional handicap.\nThe growing number of infections and deaths caused by\nnew virus frightens many Chinese who on Monday\nafter the extended New Year\'s holidays at their place of work\nreturn. In the social media, discontent with the\nAuthorities and doubts about the official case numbers are loud. The\nVacation had been extended to contain the spread of the virus.\nIn Spain, meanwhile, a second infection with\nCoronavirus confirmed. In Mallorca be one person\ntested positive for the pathogen, the national\nMicrobiology centre. Tests on three other persons\nnegative results. The four are with someone in France\nhave been in contact where the disease subsequently\nhad been diagnosed. Five new cases had previously been reported in France. The French Minister for Health, Agnes Buzyn, said that a child and four adults with British citizenship had been tested positive for the virus in France. Twelve cases in Germany refer to a Chinese employee of the Bavarian car supplier Webasto. Two returnees from China were also tested positively. In addition, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) data (Friday evening stand) there are cases in Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia, Belgium, Finland and Sweden. There are at least 37 infected people in Europe.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation WHO a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan\nYeah. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death\nYeah. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nAccording to its own information, the WHO opposes the dissemination of false information concerning the new virus. They caused confusion and fear in the population, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\n" We are therefore also fighting the trolls and conspiracy theorists who spread false information and thus undermine the work against the outbreak,"Tedros said. To do this, you should be in contact with numerous social networks." We have asked them to filter out false information and to promote correct information from reliable sources."On Instagram and YouTube, the WHO has also sought contact with influenza sufferers and influenza sufferers and has asked them to spread factual news about the virus. According to Tedros, the focus is on the Asia-Pacific region.\nAccording to a study by Chinese scientists, the novel virus could also be transmitted via faeces. Some patients in a hospital in Wuhan would have had diarrhoea and nausea before the onset of fever symptoms and difficulty breathing, according to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nThe course of the disease started with diarrhoea and nausea for ten percent of 138 patients, writes the scientists. They indicated that in the early cases of the first disease to occur in Wuhan in December, they all focused on respiratory symptoms. Symptoms associated with the digestive tract may have been overlooked.\nThe Sars virus, which is also caused by coronary viruses, was also partially transmitted during the epidemic at the beginning of the zero years. David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, warned that faecal infection, especially in hospitals, could pose a new challenge for the control of viral disease. The main route of transmission of the virus continues to be a drop infection via the cough of a patient.\n'
'888888,1,Japan has confirmed a third case of infection by China\'s coronavirus, the health ministry said on Saturday.\nThe latest case was confirmed in a woman in her 30s who lives in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak.

Authorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million.\nIn Beijing on Saturday, workers in white protective suits checked temperatures of passengers entering the subway at the central railway station, while some train services in eastern China\'s Yangtze River Delta region were suspended, the local railway operator said.\nThe number of confirmed cases in China stands at 1,287, the National Health Commission said on Saturday.\nThe virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, Malaysia, France, the United States and Australia.\nAustralia on Saturday announced its first case of coronavirus, a Chinese national in his 50s, who had been in Wuhan and arrived from China on Jan. 19 on a flight from Guangzhou. He is in stable condition in a Melbourne hospital.\n"Given the number of cases that have been found outside of China and the significant traffic from Wuhan city in the past to Australia, it was not unexpected that we would get some cases," Australia\'s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy told a news conference.\n"This is the first confirmed case. There are other cases being tested each day, many of them are negative, but I wouldn\'t be surprised if we had further confirmed cases."\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday it had 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases, both in people who had travelled to Wuhan.\nREINFORCEMENTS TO WUHAN\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an "emergency in China" this week but stopped short of declaring it of international concern.\nHuman-to-human transmission has been observed in the virus.\nChina\'s National Health Commission said on Saturday it had formed six medical teams totalling 1,230 medical staff to help Wuhan. Three of the six teams, from Shanghai, Guangdong and military hospitals have arrived in Wuhan.\nHubei province, where authorities are rushing to build a 1,000 bed hospital in six days to treat patients, announced on Saturday that there were 658 patients affected by the virus in treatment, 57 of whom were critically ill.\nThe newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\nSymptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing conditions, the WHO said.\nNEW YEAR DISRUPTIONS\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, though some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings and of the lockdown.\nHealth officials fear the transmission rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel before and during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which began on Saturday, although many have cancelled their plans, with airlines and railways in China providing free refunds.\nThe virus outbreak and efforts to contain it have put a dampener on what is ordinarily a festive time of year.\nShanghai Disneyland was closed from Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last year\'s Lunar New Year holiday.\nBeijing\'s Lama Temple, where people traditionally make offerings for the new year, has also closed, as have some other temples and the Forbidden City, the capital\'s most famous tourist attraction.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday opened the door to a radical shift in the U.S. government\'s relationship to private industry as the coronavirus outbreak upends the nation\'s economy, saying he would back the government taking stakes in certain companies.  \n Asked if he supported the federal government moving to take an equity stake in some companies, Trump said: "I do. I really do."  \n Trump, speaking at a news conference at the White House, added: "We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry."  \n The White House did not immediately respond when asked if purchasing shares in battered companies was really under consideration. The U.S. government rarely invests in public companies except in the case of bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs.  \n The COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has sickened more than 11,000 people in the United States and killed more than 180, upending American life as it shutters schools, restaurants and businesses across the country.  \n Bailout requests related to the spread of health crisis, in the form of direct grants, loans, loan guarantees and tax relief, have topped $2 trillion. Companies generally do not welcome government ownership for fear they would lose control of their business, however.  \n  \n PRECEDENT  \n Taking stakes in companies is not without precedent in times of crisis.  \n The Bush and Obama administrations loaned the auto industry, including General Motors and Chrysler, which is now controlled by Italy’s Fiat, $80 billion to avoid the collapse of the industry that they felt would result in the loss of millions of U.S. jobs.  \n The U.S. government spent about $50 billion to bail out GM alone. As a result of the company’s 2009 bankruptcy, the government’s investment was converted to a 61 percent equity stake in the Detroit-based automaker, plus preferred shares and a loan. The government no longer has a stake in the company.  \n Just last month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider taking a "controlling stake" in Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson to counter China-based Huawei’s dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology.  \n The Trump administration accuses Huawei of being able to spy on customers and has led a global campaign to convince allies to keep the blacklisted company out of their 5G networks.  \n Even if the idea of ownership stakes is ultimately discarded, sweeping measures to mitigate the economic fallout from coronavirus seem inevitable.  \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday urged Congress to pass a $1 trillion economic relief measure by early next week, adding the government was focused on being able to provide liquidity to companies.  \n Asked if a trillion dollar stimulus is enough, Trump said: "We will know about that later. We\'ll see what happens. It depends how long, so much depend on what\'s going on in this room, in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its track the virus, it\'s plenty. If we can\'t, we\'ll have to go back and talk." REUTERS \n '

Staff were told to wear masks, avoid face-to-face meetings and the canteen was closed, he said.\nAnother employee surnamed Chen said the insurance company he worked for forbid people from taking public transport.\n“My home is in Huairou district which is far from downtown,” he said\n. “I usually take subways but this morning it cost me 200 yuan one way by cab.”\nHubei, the province hit hardest by the outbreak, remains in virtual lockdown, with its train stations and airports shut and its roads sealed off.\nSome restrictions on people entering and leaving residential compounds are in place in many other cities across China, and schools in many regions will be shut until the end of February.\nAcross mainland China, there were 3,062 new confirmed infections on Sunday, bringing the total number to 40,171, according to the National Health Commission (NHC), with 908 dead.\n“Markets will be sensitive to coronavirus news as factories and ports in China reopen. The extent to which that is achievable will indicate the level of ongoing disruption,” ANZ economists wrote in a note.\nThe extended closure of factories in the world’s second-largest economy has raised concerns for global supply chains.\nChina’s central bank has taken a raft of steps to support the economy, including reducing interest rates and flushing the market with liquidity. From Monday, it will provide special funds for banks to re-lend to businesses combating the virus.\nTaiwan’s Foxconn has received Chinese government approval to resume production at a key plant in the north China city of Zhengzhou, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Monday.\nTesla, Daimler and Ford Motor are among carmakers that have said that they will restart production at their factories on Monday. Gaming giant Tencent Holdings said it had asked staff to continue working from home until Feb. 21.\nSamsung Electronics resumed production at its home appliance factory in China on Monday, while it continues to run its chip factory in China, a spokeswoman said.\nKia Motors is suspending production at its three car plants in South Korea on Monday for at least a day due to a shortage of auto parts from China related to the coronavirus outbreak, a company official said\n.\nThe WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency on Jan. 30, days after the Chinese central government imposed a lockdown on 60 million people in Hubei province.\nThe WHO took nearly two weeks to get the government’s green light on the composition of its advance team of experts, which left Geneva on Sunday.\nOver the weekend, an American hospitalized in the central city of Wuhan became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the disease. A Japanese man who also died there was another suspected victim.\nThe virus has also spread to at least 27 countries and territories, according to a Reuters count based on official reports, infecting more than 330 people.\nTwo deaths have been reported outside mainland China - both of them Chinese nationals.\n(GRAPHIC: Comparing new coronavirus to SARS and MERS - here)\n'

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — To ensure that Singapore residents continue to observe good public and personal hygiene even beyond the Covid-19 outbreak, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) on Friday (March 6) announced a new SG Clean Taskforce.\xa0 \n The taskforce will introduce mandatory cleaning standards from 2021, at places such as preschools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres. It will also encourage the public to adopt personal hygiene practices among other measures.\xa0 \n It will build on the work from the SG Clean campaign announced last month, which introduced a cleanliness indicator that has been rolled out at hawker centres and coffee shops nationwide. \n Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said at a press conference on Friday that raised hygiene standards will have to be our “new norms”, and that decontamination of the environment is “a common and shared responsibility”.\xa0 \n "This is the best way forward because this is how we can carry on with our lives while making some adjustments... What we know now is that from our research… is that the environment contamination is an important factor in the transmission of the virus, but we also found that it is easily decontaminated,” he said.\xa0 \n The announcement of the new taskforce comes a day after Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that Singapore “must expect to see significantly higher numbers" of new Covid-19 cases in time to come.\xa0 \n Speaking in Parliament during the Ministry of Health\'s (MOH) Committee of Supply debate, Mr Gan said that as the number of cases outside mainland China continues to grow at an “alarming rate”, that Singapore has to adopt a Whole-of-Government approach and mobilise the resources of all the relevant agencies to mount a swift and effective response. \n MANDATORY CLEANING STANDARDS \n Amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act will be made later this year to introduce mandatory cleaning standards. This will include, for example, details on the frequency at which high-contact areas such as public toilets are cleaned and disinfected.\xa0 \n In addition, greater accountability will be placed on-premise managers for the cleanliness of their premises. They will be required to submit and implement an environmental sanitation programme and ensure that cleanliness issues on their premises are resolved.\xa0 \n They will also need to appoint a trained “designated person” to assist them to develop and enforce the environmental sanitation programme.\xa0 \n The National Environment Agency will also work with sectoral leads to “progressively implement” the new requirements from 2021, starting with higher-risk premises such as preschools, schools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres.\xa0 \n “The Government will put standards in place and take enforcement action when it is not met,” Mr Zulkifli added.\xa0 \n ADJUSTING SOCIAL NORMS  The SG Clean Taskforce will also introduce measures to adjust social norms, by encouraging the use of serving spoons when sharing food and keeping tables clean, among other behaviours. \n It will also be encouraging the “7 habits of good public hygiene”, which includes washing hands and the daily taking of temperature to reduce the risks of spreading diseases.\xa0 \n Minister of National Development Lawrence Wong speaking at the press conference said that while improving public hygiene is the “easiest to tackle”, it is personal hygiene and social norms that are “a bit more difficult”.\xa0 \n “That is why we need everyone to step up… The good news is that we do see habits already changing.”\xa0 \n The SG Clean Taskforce, which was announced on Friday, builds on the SG Clean campaign launched on Feb 16.\xa0 \n One component of the campaign is a cleanliness indicator called the “SG Clean quality mark” which is awarded to premises such as hawker stalls and coffee shops that “commit to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists”.\xa0 \n To date, 1,907 hawker and market stalls, and 345 coffee shop stalls, as well as 13 hawker centres and 49 coffee shops have been awarded the SG Clean quality mark. \n Said Mr Wong: “Increasingly, social efforts become an important line of our defence, what we do within Singapore.” \n “That is why this SG Clean campaign is vital to Singapore… They seem simple but they really seem to have an effective way of slowing down the virus.”\xa0 \n In a Facebook post on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also wrote about the importance of hygiene and cleanliness. \n "More and more people are getting infected all over the world. Singapore has restricted travellers from badly hit countries, but we can’t close our borders completely. So we must expect more cases and clusters to pop up in Singapore," he wrote.\xa0 \n He said while\xa0Singapore has been quite successful in identifying patients, tracing contacts and stamping out clusters,\xa0we also need to slow the spread of the virus\xa0and that means raising\xa0hygiene standards. \n "Better hygiene must be our first line of defence," he wrote.\xa0 \n \xa0 \n '
'888888,0,SHANGHAI (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus epidemic is accelerating a shake-out in China\'s property sector as a cash crunch forces distressed developers to throw in the towel. \n With lockdowns across the world\'s most-populous nation entering their third month, smaller home builders are being pushed to the brink because they can\'t get enough money from pre-sales of apartments to cover their costs. \n In the first two months of this year, around 105 real estate firms issued bankruptcy filing statements, after almost 500 collapses in 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \n "A vast number of mid- to small-sized developers will face a choice no one wants to make - either sell their property assets and start another business, or be bought out," China Index Holdings Research Director Huang Yu said. \n "The shake-out is just beginning." \n Even before the new coronavirus, China\'s housing market was under pressure. \n Home prices rose at the slowest pace in almost two years in January and several developers, saddled with debt they\'re struggling to service, began to dial back on construction. S&P Global Ratings said in a note on Tuesday (March 10) that as Covid-19 spreads, the squeeze may be felt most acutely by Chinese banks and property firms. \n As a result, mergers and acquisitions among the nation\'s almost 100,000 real estate companies will ramp up again in 2020, Mr Yu said, declining to put a number on the expected deal value. \n "Declining sales will hurt developers\' liquidity, as the proceeds still form the largest and most important funding source," S&P credit analyst Christopher Yip said, noting that with construction largely paused, delivery schedules and revenue recognition are being pushed further out. \n "Several companies already in the CCC category or with low ratings with negative outlooks may face liquidity issues." \n New York-based Avenue Capital Group, a firm that trades distressed debt and invests in special situations, said a China home market in flux spells increasingly versatile buying opportunities. It\'s looking at scooping up soured developer debt and buying troubled real estate projects at a discount. \n "There\'ll be more bargains appearing on the market," said Wang Yifeng, Avenue Capital\'s Shanghai-based head of China. "If you see a distressed seller among the country\'s top 100 firms, don\'t be surprised." \n Construction Halted According to S&P, new home sales in China will register their first drop in 12 years this year, with transactions down as much as 15 per cent. That\'s if the virus reaches a turning point this month. If the nadir isn\'t until April, sales could be down around 20 per cent, akin to the hit taken during the 2008 global financial crisis. \n Fusheng Group\xa0is one of the first mid-sized developers to falter. The debt-laden company, based in China\'s southeastern Fujian province, was in talks to sell a 70 per cent stake to a consortium led by Shimao Property Holdings, people familiar with the matter said in December. \n Local media reported in January that a new joint venture has been established, with Fusheng injecting its jettisoned property projects into the fresh vehicle. Shimao is one of the nation\'s biggest developers. \n Representatives from Fusheng didn\'t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. \n Cash flows of less competent players have been sliding for years and the virus is only making matters worse, according to Wu Rui, an executive director of non-performing assets at private equity firm CDH Investments Fund Management Co.\xa0Asset-management companies are teaming up with top developers and eyeing such businesses, he said. \n In Hubei alone, the epicentre of the virus, there are around 4,300 developers. Home prices in Hubei\'s provincial city Wuhan rose at one of the fastest paces in the world last year, Knight Frank data show. \n To the north, in central Henan province, the general manager of one small developer said the only target his company had set, in early February, was to make all of its debt repayments over the next six months. \n Another manager at a small developer based in Zhejiang, a province in China\'s east, said the firm was two months away from bankruptcy. Its four projects under construction are halted because of the virus, he said. \n "The epidemic could actually be a fresh opportunity for big developers," said Liu Ce, who\'s in charge of growth strategy at another large homebuilder, Shenzhen-based Kaisa Group Holdings. \n "We can pull many levers to alleviate cash flow stress. Once you live through that, you see the wave of asset offloading by small players as a good chance." \n Kaisa became the first, and only, Chinese developer to default on its US dollar debt in April 2015. It went through a huge debt restructure and spent years rebuilding its balance sheet and credit rating. \n Now, it\'s regained investor confidence; Kaisa has already sold US$1.2 billion (S$1.67 billion) of bonds this year and in January, bought a site in Hong Kong\'s New Territories for HK$3.5 billion (S$630 million) to expand its foothold in the city. \n But while the likes of Kaisa, Shimao and China Evergrande Group have hundreds of property projects nationwide, the majority of China\'s developers are small and unlisted, with sometimes just a handful of projects in one city. They\'re the ones most at risk from the twin forces of coronavirus and a slowing market. \n Smaller developers also typically do not rely on bank loans or bond sales to alleviate funding concerns. Instead, they count on inflows from apartment sales, as well as shadow financing. \n Policymakers have so far refrained from unleashing wholesale monetary stimulus measures for real estate firms, fearing that could result in a surge in home prices. Most support has come from marginal easing by local governments. The central bank reiterated earlier this month that real estate "definitely" won\'t be used to stimulate the economy. \n Shenzhen on Wednesday allowed builders to draw on some cash deposits, which are usually held in reserve by banks during construction to ensure developers don\'t abandon projects. Still, local officials stressed the current home-buying restrictions won\'t be loosened. \n Coronavirus may be the "straw that broke the camel\'s back for many small builders", said Xie Yangchun, an analyst at China Real Estate Information Corp. \n "A new wave of industry consolidation has started." \n '

'888888,0,Since Tuesday, the Bremen Medical Laboratory has also been offering the so-called RT PCR test, which can be used to detect a disease with the Chinese-derived coronary viruses. Future cases of suspicion can thus be investigated much more quickly. On the other hand, in the two suspected cases reported so far in Bremen and Bremerhaven, doctors had to wait a long time for the results of the examination of samples sent to the laboratory in the Berlin Charite. Only in the case of Bremerhaven, a negative finding was found on Tuesday evening. The post office is delaying the investigation. "I do not understand the lack of direct messengers in Bremen," commented Hans-Michael Muhlenfeld, president of the Bremen Association of Physicians.\nThe one on 16th. In January, officially presented by the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) at the Charite, the only way to safely diagnose the disease is by now. The Charite is the so-called Consulate Laboratory for Coronaviruses, and thus always the first place in Germany when it comes to developing or adapting test procedures for this group of viruses. In addition to the laboratory in Bremen, the National Health Agency in Lower Saxony in Hanover and some university clinics have been able to carry out the test since Tuesday.\nSymptoms of respiratory disease alone are not sufficient for a diagnosis. They correspond largely to a normal cold with cough and fever. The disease is not considered to be life-threatening for healthy people without a pre-existing disease.\nA suspicion of Coronavirus is only close when the person concerned stopped in China until 14 days before the symptoms occurred. This is particularly true if she was travelling in the province of Hubei, which was designated as a risk area, for which the Foreign Office has issued a travel alert.\nYeah. Against this background, the Bremen University advises students of its study program "Applied Economics and International Corporate Governance China" to cancel the current year abroad in China.\nIn medical practice, according to Hans-Michael Muhlenfeld, the question of a Chinese stay is the crucial criterion to distinguish a possible coronary virus disease from the known flu-like infections that occur at this time of the year anyway. This is also in line with the recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute, which are still valid. However, since one of four confirmed cases in Bavaria on Tuesday revealed that the patient was not in China but had contracted an infection from a person who had entered from China, the experts are currently discussing new recommendations.\n"We expect a decision on this in the coming days," says Martin Goetz, Head of Unit for Infection Protection at the Health Authority. At the same time, he regrets that the investigation of the suspected cases is taking so long and talks about "processes not yet recorded" in dealing with the new disease with a view to an apparently neglected express shipment of the samples to Berlin. The Eastern Clinic is intended as a future central reception station for all suspected cases in Bremen.\nHousehold doctors also know what to do in the future, according to Millfield. People who have complained of symptoms such as fever and cough and have been to China before, the general practitioner recommends that they report to the doctor\'s practice by phone first. With the new on-site laboratory capacities you can gain certainty within 24 hours and thus avoid needlessly long precautionary stays in isolation, says Goetz.\nSo far, medical practices and emergency ambulances have not increased patient turnover\nYeah. On request, however, the Bremen Medical Association confirms numerous requests from doctors: they wanted to know how best to prepare for suspicious cases. The Health Department also received calls from concerned citizens asking about oral protection masks. In fact, the Bremen Pharmaceutical Chamber reports a sale of such masks which, according to experts, offer little protection.\n'
"888888,0,What is going to be the future of Covid-19 in India? For how long coronavirus will infect people here? How many people are going to fall sick with Covid-19 in India? And how many people may die of Covid-19 here? No one has a sure answer to these questions. Possibly because no one can have an answer to these questions. But in case you are curious there is an online tool created by a machine learning expert that shows the course Covid-19 pandemic may take in India. It is a simple tool, but one based on SEIR model that scientists and public health experts use to predict epidemic in a given region.\nThe tool has been created by Gabriel Goh, a machine learning researcher.\nThere is nothing official about the tool but during a time when the information from government experts may not be coming or coming fast enough it can shed some clarity on what Covid-19 can do to India. Depending on what measures the country takes, and what impact these measures have on Covid-19 infections in India, coronavirus may end up killing around 1000 people to 5 million people in India, according to the Epidemic Calculator. Why such gap between these two numbers?\nAccording to the Epidemic Calculator, it all depends on flattening the curve, bringing down R0 the rate at which infections spread and at what stage the lockdown was enforced and ordered.\nAt the time of writing, the coronavirus disease of 2019 remains a global health crisis of grave and uncertain magnitude. To the non-expert (such as myself), contextualizing the numbers, forecasts and epidemiological parameters described in the media and literature can be challenging. I created this calculator as an attempt to address this gap in understanding, notes Goh. This calculator implements a classical infectious disease model -- SEIR (Susceptible > Exposed > Infected > Removed) -- an idealized model of spread still used in frontlines of research.\nBy default the tool already has the relevant data, based on the research reports that have come out on Covid-19 from China and other countries so far, in the required fields. To see how Covid-19 will progress in India on the basis of this available data about coronavirus, and how it infects people, how many it kills, for how long it keeps people sick, all you need to do is change the population of the region to India’s population.\nHere are some projections this tool gives as far Covid-19 and its future progression in India is concerned:\nCovid-19 in India with default data\nWith default data, which considers the infection rate R0 of 2.2 it means a coronavirus patient is likely to infect at least two more people the coronavirus Epidemic Calculator indicates that in a year the disease will infect a little over 1 million people in India. Of these, it will kill little over 20,000 people. While you look at these numbers, there are a few important bits to remember.\n-- By default the Epidemic Calculator assumes that on the 100th day after the first reported case the government has forced the region or country into a full lockdown.\n-- The lockdown or intervention in some other way, brings down the R0 to less than 1. This is very important.\n-- If the lockdown or intervention has brought the R0 lower earlier, say just 50 days after the first case was reported, the total number of cases will be significantly less and number of fatalities exponentially lower.\n-- It is also important to remember that by default the Epidemic Calculator considers fatality rate for Covid-19 as 2 per cent. In China, it has been slightly more. In South Korea and Germany it is significantly less. In Italy and Spain, it is alarmingly high, particularly in Italy where it is above 8 per cent. If you consider other figures for India depending on which one you do the covid-19 picture will change.\nThe covid-19 case fatality rate for India is something neither experts nor Epidemic Calculator can predict. The global fatality rate for swine flu is less than 0.1 per cent. But in India, in the previous swine flu epidemics, the death rate has been close to 6 per cent. For Covid-19 only time will tell what is the fatality rate in India.\nCovid-19 in India a best case scenario\nSo, what is the best case scenario for covid-19 in India. If everything works well in India, if government mounts a good response, and death rate is not above 2 per cent, health care system holds up, quarantine is effective, then covid-19 may end up infecting a little above 15,000 people. This also takes into account the fact that in India the first case was detected on January 30 and the lockdown was ordered on March 24. Assuming that the coronavirus became infectious in India a few days before the first patient was detected, we can say that the country mounted effective response on around Day 65 of the disease. This can potentially limit number of Ccovid-19 cases in India to around 15,000 and deaths to around 300. Let's hope this is the case.\nCovid-19 in India worst case scenario\nNow, take the worst case scenario. This is the one where the data that we have so far from the government is not accurate, the quarantine is not effective, the health system is not ready and will not be able to hold up well, that the disease is spreading in India undetected for far longer even though the first case was only found on January 30. In this case, also assume that India’s poor health system will not be able to cope up with Covid-19 when cases start to rise and let’s move the case fatality rate to 4 per cent, which is still significantly lower than what Covid-19 is showing in Italy and Spain but is higher than the global rate. Let’s also assume that the quarantine doesn’t bring down the R0 much. May be a half per cent or so but not enough to flatten the curve in one year.\nIn this case, given that population of India is little over 1.3 billion, we may end up seeing around 180 million infected in the country this year and little over 5 million dead.\nThis is all projection\nIt’s important to note that Covid-19 epidemic calculator is a tool that creates projections on the basis of data you feed into it. And as far as Covid-19 and novel coronavirus are concerned, right now not enough data, and not accurate enough data, is available. Everything is an approximation. What is the real fatality rate of Covid-19? Different countries are showing different numbers and they are all over the place, with extremely huge gaps between them. How quickly and how widely this is R0 that Covid-19 spreads? Again, we don’t know the exact number. Some studies say it is 4. Some say it is 2. Some even say that it is 6.\nThen there are other unknowns. Can Covid-19 re-infect people who were sick with it and then got better? We don’t know for sure. Does temperature India is a very hot country and dry air summer is coming in parts of India affect this coronavirus? And if it does, how much? We don’t know for sure. There are many more factors, like real world conditions. How long Covid-19 patients take to recover? For how long they are infectious? For how long they have to be in a hospital? For how long a country can care for its ICU patients? These are the figures that government experts and policy makers probably know. An online epidemic calculator doesn’t. So if you are giving the online epidemic calculator created by Gabriel Goh a spin, keep this in mind.\n"
'888888,0,(Reuters) - The coronavirus epidemic could impact the National Hockey League’s plans to have preseason games in China later this year, according to a report on the North American league’s website.\nThe NHL held preseason games in China in 2017 and 2018 but did not return in 2019 because of logistical issues with booking arenas. Any hope of returning this year may be put on hold until the coronavirus is brought under control.\n“We’re monitoring,” NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said in a report on the NHL’s website.\n“It’s hard not to monitor it. It seems to be coming closer to us every time, every day that goes by. Certainly, it impacts what our plans will be in China in the future and in the relatively near future.”\nThe flu-like virus is believed to have originated in a market selling wildlife in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has infected some 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700, the vast majority in China. It has since spread to dozens of countries.\nA number of international sports events have been affected by the coronavirus, with some competitions being postponed and others canceled outright.\nLast August, Daly said the NHL hoped to announce preseason games in China for next season “in the next couple months.”\nThe NHL played its first ever preseason games in China in 2017 and returned the following year for another two games as part of its commitment to grow the game globally.\n“Obviously we haven’t announced any games there for next (season),” Daly said this week.\n“I think there was certainly a hope that we would be able to play preseason games there next year. I would say that hope probably continues to exist, but as time goes on, it becomes far more problematic.”\nThe NHL season begins in early October.\n'
'888888,0,The Iranian state agency IRNA came forward this Wednesday that two Iranians died from the new Covid-19 coronavirus, just hours after the Iranian authorities confirmed the first two cases of infection in Iran. Identified as Alireza Vahabzadeh, who needed the death victims, two elderly people, to be located at Qom, about two miles south of the country\'s capital, Tehran.\n"Unfortunately, the two people died in an intensive care unit because of their old age and a weak immune system," wrote IRNA, citing another source of the Iranian Ministry of Health, Kianouche Jahanpour. Reports of these deaths appear a few hours after the Iranian authorities have confirmed the existence of two cases of Covid-19 coronavirus infection, the first recorded in that country.\nInternational agencies indicate that it is the same patients who ultimately did not resist the symptoms associated with Covid-19, which may lead to potentially serious respiratory diseases such a s pneumonia. In statements to the ISNA semi-official news agency, Kiyanoush Jahanpour stated this Wednesday morning that "in the last two days, some suspicious cases of the new coronavirus have been detected".\nThe new Covid-2019 coronavirus was first detected at the end of the year in Wuhan, Hubei Province (central China). Since then, alongside mainland China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, other cases of infection of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in around thirty countries and territories.\nThe number of infected has already surpassed the 75 thousand people globally, the vast majority being in Chinese territory. Only in mainland China, the number of deaths has already exceeded the two thousand (2.004), between 74 and 74.185 confirmed cases of infection, according to the latest Beijing data.\nThe WHO declared in mid-January an international public health emergency, which presupposes the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures'
'888888,0,Policymakers and government leaders have taken a range of approaches to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Here is a list of how some of the world\'s biggest economies and economic blocs have reacted.\nUNITED STATES\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday instructed the U.S. Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted, saying it would provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.\nTrump also said he was ordering the Small Business Administration to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus by providing low-interest loans to small businesses in affected states and territories, effective immediately. And he suspended all travel from Europe, with a few exceptions, to the United States for 30 days starting on Friday.\nEarlier, Trump signed a $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the spread of the virus and develop vaccines for the highly contagious disease.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by half a percentage point in its first emergency rate move since the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Investors expect more cuts in the weeks ahead.\nCHINA\nChina said it had earmarked 110.5 billion yuan ($15.9 billion) to fight the epidemic.\nBeijing has ramped up funding support for virus-hit regions and the country\'s central bank has cut several of its key rates, including the benchmark lending rate, and has urged banks to give cheap loans and payment relief to exposed companies.\nChina will modify the environmental supervision of companies to help the resumption of production disrupted by the coronavirus epidemic, giving firms more time to rectify environmental problems.\nJAPAN\nJapan unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, focusing on support to small and mid-sized firms, as concerns mount about risks to the fragile economy.\nSeparately, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has pledged to pump more liquidity into markets and step up asset buying.\nJapan\'s central bank may also take steps to ensure companies hit by the coronavirus outbreak do not face a financial squeeze before the end of the current fiscal year in March, according to sources familiar with the central bank\'s thinking.\nEUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nThe ECB, the central bank of the euro zone, has so far avoided cutting interest rates. Policymakers did hold an unscheduled meeting on March 3 but it was to discuss operational responses to coronavirus, such as whether to hold events and staff shortages, rather than any policy response, sources close to the matter said.\nThe ECB has asked euro zone banks to review their business continuity plans and the actions they can take to prepare for and minimize the potential adverse effects of the coronavirus, a letter seen by Reuters shows.\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION\nEuropean Union leaders have so far failed to agree radical measures to tackle the crisis. The head of the bloc\'s executive Ursula von der Leyen said the European Commission will set up a joint investment fund with firepower of 25 billion euros ($28 billion) from existing resources to cushion the blow to vulnerable sectors of the bloc\'s economies.\nGERMANY\nGermany\'s centre-left coalition agreed to increase public investments by 12.4 billion euros by 2024 and to make it easier for companies to claim subsidies to support workers on reduced working hours to counter the effects of the coronavirus epidemic.\nChancellor Angela Merkel\'s conservatives are split over whether Germany should rush out a fiscal stimulus package to counter any impact of the coronavirus on Europe\'s largest economy.\nBudget experts estimate the government has the fiscal room for additional measures worth at least 17 billion euros ($18.9 billion). Some officials say that Berlin could even put together a stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros, without ditching the government\'s policy of no new debt.\nBRITAIN\nBritain launched a 30 billion-pound ($39 billion) economic stimulus plan just hours after the Bank of England slashed interest rates, a double-barrelled package aimed at warding off the risk of a coronavirus recession.\nThe Bank of England cut interest rates by half a percentage point and offered banks cheaper funding and a reduction in capital buffers in an emergency move to bolster Britain\'s economy against disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFRANCE\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Marie has said that Europe needs to be ready to use fiscal stimulus to deal with the impact of the coronavirus.\nThe government is allowing companies to suspend payments of some social charges and taxes, and is activating state-subsidised short-time work schemes. It has ordered the Bpifrance state investment bank to guarantee loans needed to overcome short-term cashflow problems.\nParis has also allowed companies to declare force majeure due to the outbreak if they cannot honor a contract with the public sector, and is putting pressure on big companies to show similar leniency with subcontractors.\nINDIA\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to infuse fresh cash liquidity into the system through a second round of long-term repo operations (LTRO), government officials told Reuters, amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak will derail any revival of economic growth. One official said the RBI might inject as much as 1 trillion rupees ($13.6 billion) in the round that will begin as early as April.\nThe RBI has said it stands ready to act to maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability.\nThe government is, meanwhile, pushing state-run banks to approve new loans amounting to 500-600 billion rupees by the end of March, according to government sources.\nITALY\nItaly has doubled the amount it plans to spend on tackling its coronavirus outbreak to 7.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion) and is raising this year\'s deficit goal to 2.5% of national output from the current 2.2% target.\nPayments on mortgages will be suspended across the whole of Italy and Italy\'s banking lobby ABI said lenders would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout from the virus.\nCANADA\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau said on March 9 that the government was "looking at taking some initiatives this week," as Canada reported its first coronavirus death, with a steep decline in oil prices expected to hit the world\'s fourth-largest crude producer hard.\nThe Bank of Canada lowered its benchmark overnight rate to 1.25% from 1.75% in response to the epidemic, prompting money markets to price in a better-than-even chance of another reduction next month. The last time it cut by 50 basis points was in 2009 during the financial crisis.\nSOUTH KOREA\nThe government announced a stimulus package of 11.7 trillion won ($9.8 billion) to cushion the impact of the largest outbreak of coronavirus outside China.\nFinance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the supplementary budget, subject to parliamentary approval, would channel money to the health system, childcare, and outdoor markets. An additional 10.3 trillion won in treasury bonds will be issued this year to fund the extra budget.\nSeoul has also dramatically tightened rules on short-selling for three months. Starting March 11, stocks with a sudden and abnormal increase in short-selling transactions will be suspended from further short-selling for 10 days.\n'

'888888,0,The last few months of 2019 were good for Apple.

"It is more 8% than a year ago", stressed Apple\'s executive president during the presentation of the results of the first fiscal quarter of 2020 (which includes information on October, November and December of 2019). "This is thanks to the extraordinary search for iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max.

From here, the biggest slices were for Mac computers (7,2 billion dollars) and iPad (six billion dollars). The results even exceeded Apple\'s expectations, which had predicted a total revenue between 85,5 billion dollars and 89,5 billion dollars. W\nNevertheless, Tim Cook made a point of highlighting increases in other services. It is an area in which the company has invested heavily and whose growth has helped compensate for quarters in which iPhone sales descend, as happened last year.\n"We arrived at 12,7 billion dollars, representing a record climb of 17% from last year," Tim Cook said about services like Apple Music and Apple Play. The company hopes that over time the value will increase, with the largest bet on Apple TV+, which is the response to streaming services such as Netflix, HBO or YouTube Originals\nYeah. For the moment, the service had no "material impact" on quarterly results, with the company emphasising that it was only launched in November. "Let\'s stay focused on telling stories that matter," Tim Cook said.\nDuring the presentation of the results, the coronavirus was also topical, with the company admitting that it has suppliers in Wuhan and that the virus can hinder operations in Apple factories in China. "All these suppliers are alternative sources. And we are obviously working on plans to mitigate and compensate for any loss at the production level,"Tim Cook said, noting that the company has made donations to organizations working in the area.\nAlthough the company does not depend on suppliers in Wuhan, Apple notes that many companies, which were due to reopen in late January at the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations, will remain closed until February 10th.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\n"In terms of consumer support and sales, we closed one of our shops and many partner shops also closed," Cook added. "The shops that remain open are working at reduced hours. We are taking additional precautions such as thoroughly cleaning our shops regularly and monitoring the temperature of workers."\nIn view of this, Apple hopes to achieve a revenue between the 63 billion dollars and the 67 billion dollars between January and March 2020.\n'

All of them remain in stable condition, and most are improving, the ministry added. \n As of noon on Monday, 262 of the suspected cases have tested negative for the virus. Test results for the remaining 32 cases are pending. Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is being carried out. \n The MOH said that once a confirmed case has been identified, it will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. \n In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor the status of their health. \n The ministry has identified 256 close contacts as of noon on Monday, with 187\xa0still in Singapore, of which\xa0186 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated.\xa0 \n Efforts are being made\xa0to contact the\xa0 remaining close contact. \n The authorities earlier said that two Singaporean women evacuated from Wuhan had been infected with the coronavirus. \n The women, both aged 47, were asymptomatic when they boarded the specially arranged Scoot flight TR121 that carried 92 Singaporeans from the Chinese city, which is on lockdown.

'888888,1,SHANGHAI - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading COVID-19 without knowing they are sick.  \n As the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. The border of Hubei province, epicentre of the virus, opened on Wednesday after a two-month shutdown.  \n But there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation.  \n Asymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious disease, making it harder to detect and stop transmission.  \n In China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000.  \n China had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday.  \n Asymptomatic cases are currently found through "contact tracing". China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms.  \n "Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing," said Wu Zunyou of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. "So will they be able to create transmission? They won\'t."  \n Still, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing\'s commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control.  \n Despite recording zero new infections from March 18 to March 22, the COVID-19 hotspot city of Wuhan disclosed on March 20 that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year old man surnamed Zhang had shown no symptoms.  \n Citing hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient.  \n China says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage. But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined.  \n Some experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased.  \n "It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing," said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney.  \n It is also unclear how much they might infect others.  \n "We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that’s a major driver of transmission," said Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization at a briefing early in March.  \n New studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan.  \n While many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill.  \n Another study published on March 23, looking at cases in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18% of patients were asymptomatic. Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest.  \n The Yale School of Public Health said the existence of presymptomatic (asymptomatic) patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries.  \n "The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected," said Ian Henderson, Director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University.

SIA is an outstanding airline and a strategic asset for Singapore. \n “Through the government support for the aviation sector and if necessary, more direct support measures, we will make sure that SIA is able to come through this in good shape,” Mr Heng said when he was unveiling more measures for the aviation sector hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.\xa0 \n The coronavirus that has infected more than 410,000 people across more than 190 countries has simultaneously wreaked havoc on the aviation industry globally, with demand for international air travel obliterated and governments closing their borders to curb the spread of the disease which had its first outbreak in Wuhan, China. \n SIA has not been spared and has had to implement cost-cutting measures recently, as its chief executive officer Goh Choon Pong announced that he would take a 30 per cent pay cut and others in senior management also taking a 20 to 25 per cent pay cut.\xa0 \n Its pilots will be required to take up to seven days of no-pay leave a month from April, while other staff members will have to take one to two days of no-pay leave between April and May.\xa0 \n On Thursday morning, the airline announced a trading halt. \n Earlier this week, SIA said that it will ground almost all its fleet that was originally scheduled until the end of April.\xa0 \n The aviation industry supports more than 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product and 375,000 jobs. \n SIA, SilkAir and Scoot account for more than half of the passengers flying in and out of Changi Airport, SIA said. \n SIA chairman Peter Seah said: “This is an exceptional time for the SIA Group. Since the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak, passenger demand has fallen precipitously amid an unprecedented closure of borders worldwide.\xa0 \n “We are especially grateful for Temasek’s strong vote of confidence. The Board is confident that this package of new funding will ensure that SIA is equipped with the resources to overcome the current challenges, and be in a position of strength to grow and reinforce our leadership in the aviation sector.” \n Mr Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara, chief executive officer of Temasek International, the management and investment arm of Temasek Holdings, said: “This transaction will not only tide SIA over a short-term financial liquidity challenge, but will position it for growth beyond the pandemic”. \n "

In total, Delta is shrinking its typical 35 U.S. weekly flights to Korea to 15.\nThe airline’s new service from Seoul-Incheon to Manila, previously scheduled to begin on March 29, will now start on May 1.\nSouth Korea has the most virus cases outside China andreported 334 new cases on Thursday for a total of 1,595. South Korea also reported its 13th death linked to the virus.\nOn Wednesday, Hawaiian Airlines Inc said it would suspend its five-times-weekly service between Honolulu and Seoul-Incheon beginning on Monday through April 30.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department on Wednesday both issued travel advisories urging Americans to avoid non-essential travel to South Korea.\nWith U.S. air travel demand slumping, JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) said that starting on Thursday through March 11, it would suspend change and cancel fees for new flight bookings for travel completed by June 1.\nThe airline said the policy “is designed to give customers confidence that they will not be charged any JetBlue fees for changes or cancellations later given evolving coronavirus concerns.”\nU.S. carriers have canceled all flights to China through late April, while the United States barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who traveled recently to China from entering the United States and required U.S. citizens who recently visited China to return home at one of 11 U.S. airports for enhanced screening.\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he was not imposing restrictions on travelers from additional countries with large numbers of cases like South Korea or Italy. He did not rule out imposing additional travel restrictions at a later date if needed.\nOn Wednesday, the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation Committee, Representative Peter DeFazio, and the chair of the subcommittee overseeing aviation, Representative Rick Larsen, wrote the U.S Transportation Department asking how the government “plans to effectively prepare for the imminent arrival of a pandemic caused by coronavirus COVID-19 on U.S. soil.”\nThe two Democrats said U.S. airlines had expressed concern about the scope of requests by the CDC and expectations regarding airlines’ collection of certain inbound passenger data. The CDC has expressed concern about its ability to access information from the airlines.\nOn Monday, United Airlines Inc (UAL.O) said near-term demand to China had almost disappeared and that demand for the rest of its trans-Pacific routes had dropped by 75%.\n'

A representative of the Centers for Disease Control and prevention briefed on the situation at a briefing on Monday.\nAccording to Reuters, there are 11 cases of new virus infection in the United States. It is reported that the Central Committee against AIDS is now negotiating with Beijing on the possibility of sending American experts to China to fight AIDS.\nLast week, about 200 Americans were evacuated from Wuhan, China. A plane landed at March air force base, California, on January 29. The Central Emergency Revolving Fund announced a 14 day quarantine.\n'
'888888,0,GENEVA/BEIJING - The new coronavirus appears to now be spreading much more rapidly outside China than within, and airports in hard-hit countries were ramping up screening of travellers.  \n World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said almost eight times as many cases had been reported outside China as inside in the previous 24 hours, adding that the risk of coronavirus spreading was now very high at a global level.  \n At a briefing in Geneva, he said outbreaks in South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan were the greatest concern, but that there was evidence that close surveillance was working in South Korea, the worst affected country outside China, and the epidemic could be contained there.  \n U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said that within 12 hours, airports across South Korea and Italy will screen all travellers for coronavirus. Pence, who has been put in charge of the U.S. response to the outbreak, also said U.S. travel restrictions may expand.  \n The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said U.S. industry expects to have the capacity to perform 1 million coronavirus tests by the end of the week.  \n The global death toll exceeded 3,000, with the number of dead in Italy jumping by 18 to 52. Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Morocco reported cases for the first time, bringing the total to more than 60 countries with the illness known as COVID-19.  \n But equity markets surged after their worst plunge since the 2008 financial crisis last week, encouraged by the prospect of government action to stem the economic impact. In the United States, the Dow jumped nearly 1,300 points, or 5%, while the S&P 500 closed 4.6% higher.  \n Finance ministers of the G7 group of leading industrialised democracies were expected to discuss measures in a conference call on Tuesday, sources told Reuters.  \n Oil prices jumped 4% amid hopes of a deeper output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  \n  \n (Graphic: Tracking the coronavirus https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html)  \n  \n MORE THAN PREDICTED  \n A senior U.S. official said he was concerned about a likely jump in the number of cases in the United States, which has had more than 90, with six deaths. More testing will almost surely lead to more confirmed cases.  \n "When you have a number of cases that you\'ve identified and they\'ve been in the community for a while, you\'re going to wind up seeing a lot more cases than you would have predicted," Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases unit at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, told CNN.  \n South Korea has had 26 deaths and reported another 599 infections on Monday, taking its tally to 4,335.  \n Of the new cases in South Korea, 377 were from the city of Daegu. That is home to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, to which most of South Korea\'s cases have been traced after some members visited the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged.  \n The Seoul government asked prosecutors to launch a murder investigation into leaders of the church. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said that if founder Lee Man-hee and other heads of the church had cooperated, fatalities could have been prevented.  \n Lee knelt and apologised to the country, saying that one church member had infected many others and calling the epidemic a "great calamity".  \n It was not immediately known how many of South Korea\'s dead were members of the church.  \n  \n \'OUTBREAKS ARE CURBED\'  \n But Wuhan itself, at the centre of the epidemic, shut the first of 16 specially built hospitals that were hurriedly put up to treat coronavirus cases, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.  \n There was also a steep fall in new cases in Hubei, the province around Wuhan, but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries.  \n The virus broke out in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, mostly in China.  \n Only eight cases were reported in China beyond Hubei on Sunday, the WHO said.  \n China\'s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun at a news conference said: “We definitely believe that with the coming of spring we’re not far from the coming of the victory of the final defeat of COVID-19.”  \n Outside China, there are now more than 8,700 infected and over 125 deaths.  \n Iran, one of the worst-hit nations, reported infections rising to 1,501, with 66 deaths, including a senior official. With stocks of gloves and other medical supplies running low in pharmacies, authorities uncovered a hoard of supplies including millions of gloves.  \n In Britain, which has 40 confirmed cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to be prepared for a further spread.  \n (For more coverage of the coronavirus,\xa0see\xa0https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484) REUTERS \n '
"888888,0,As someone with a little bit of OCD, dining out during the era of COVID-19 is like navigating a minefield. You become hyper aware of your surrounds and micro decisions are required almost every step of the way. For instance, when approaching the entrance to a restaurant, there’s the door handle: use one’s elbow or fish out a piece of tissue paper to touch it? Or perhaps wait two seconds and someone will hopefully open the door from the inside? \n Once seated, I notice the cutlery placed on the table, resting on but a flimsy barrier of paper napkin beneath. I wonder how long it’s been sitting there, and if it has picked up possible pathogens on the tabletop left by the previous customer. Is it terrible to ask for a fresh set? “I get inexplicably happy when I see forks, spoons and chopsticks individually wrapped in plastic these days,” says a colleague whose most pressing concern at the moment is not waging a war against single-use plastic. After a lengthy scrub at the toilet sink, I return and panic a little when the waiter hands me a greasy menu. Damn, should’ve washed my hands after ordering. I eye the raw items on the menu: sashimi, salad, and wonder if getting some is akin to dicing with death. \n And then, the server fills my water glass. To my dismay, he picks it up by the rim — where my lips would soon touch. Should I throw caution to the winds and drink it anyway? My equally fastidious friend laments, “just the other day, a waitress stood too close over my food and took forever to explain every single dish. I couldn't help but think of all that saliva.”  \n Many of these fears are born from paranoia, but some are legitimate causes for concern. Still, if one wanted to be almost 100% virus-free, the only way is to never leave home and eat all three meals cooked in one’s own kitchen. But because this isn’t possible for most working Singaporeans like me, it warms the cockles of my germophobe heart when I see the various safety measures painstakingly taken by many eateries during this fraught period. Especially when restaurants and even famous hawkers are seeing significant dips in their business as Singaporeans avoid crowded places. It’s tough enough cooking and waiting on people for a living, but imagine having to do that while constantly disinfecting tables, chairs, (even menus), having to take one’s temperature twice daily, washing one’s hands nonstop and trying to breathe through a surgical mask. It’s both touching and reassuring. \n Compiled below are a few of the steps employed by restaurants to help curb the spread of this virus. Now, go forth and dine out. Have a good time, support these hardworking folks and keep our makan scene alive. Just don’t forget to wash your hands. \n Seven branches including 593 Havelock Rd, S169641. Tel: 6235-7716. yahuabakkutteh.com.sg \n While the chopsticks and spoons at this Bak Kut Teh chain used to be housed in a communal container, each set is now thoughtfully wrapped in plastic and placed on every table. So you don’t have to worry about other customers’ paws digging through twenty chopsticks, or anyone coughing onto them. Not the most environmentally-friendly, but it sure is hygienic.  \n Restaurant staff ensures each guest sanitises his/her hands at the entrance before entering the dining room. \n On a recent visit, we noticed all the wait staff donning surgical face masks. “We started wearing them two weeks ago,” says an auntie.  \n  \n 23 branches including #B1-03 Paragon Shopping Mall, S238859. Tel: 6836-8336. www.dintaifung.com.sg/index \n General manager of Din Tai Fung Singapore, Hoo Hoe Keat, tells us that the restaurant chain has already been practicing certain hygiene procedures even before the COVID-19 outbreak. “Din Tai Fung is one of the pioneers in the industry to provide hand sanitisers for all our customers, as well as alcohol-based sanitisation of tables and chairs after each use at our restaurants”.  \n Mr Hoo adds: “In addition to these existing practices, we have further enhanced safety measures during this period by implementing nightly surface disinfection of restaurant premises using 75% alcohol [cleaning solutions]”. That Ghostbusters-esque (Germbusters?) spray thingy that uncle is wielding looks gratifyingly potent. Now where can we find a portable one for spraying everything?  \n There are now mandatory daily temperature checks and face masks for staff at all Din Tai Fung restaurants island-wide. The GM also tells us that the staff is separated into two teams to “minimise exposure”. Moreover, “nourishing herbal teas are provided to them and senior management members also visit the restaurants to check on their [employees’] well-being”. \n Hand sanitiser is provided for all diners at DTF — even before this virus scare.  \n Two branches including 1022 Upp Serangoon Rd, S534760, Tel: 6287-4328. www.facebook.com/pages/Yongs-Teochew-Kueh/167896229901740 \n This popular soon kueh and png kueh specialist on Upper Serangoon Road (there’s also a branch in East Coast) sees long queues on weekends. But while customers used to crowd inside the shophouse space, they’re now ushered to queue outside the storefront. A shop assistant takes orders outside, scoots back into the shop to pack the requisite kuehs and brings them out for folks. Customers then enter two at a time to pay at the cashier inside (which has been shifted to just two metres from the entrance for convenience). “We’ve reorganised things for everyone’s welfare. Instead of 15 people inside the shop waiting to order, we now allow two to three customers in at one go. So not everyone has to gather together [in an enclosed space]. It’s also airier outside,” explains towkay Desmond Koh, 61. “This is mostly on weekends when it’s busier. If there’re only a couple of customers each time on weekdays, we let them order inside the store,” he elaborates.  \n He shares: “We’ve also placed hand sanitisers at the cashier counter as well as on one of our dine-in tables. We take the temperature of our staff each day when they arrive and when they leave. And we use disinfectant to clean our items”. However, they don’t mask up because “the government says only those who are sick should wear it. Also, there’s now a mask shortage”.  \n Two outlets including #02-256 Jewel Changi Airport, S819666. www.shakeshack.com.sg  \n   \n “Shake Shack takes the temperature of all guests before they enter the Shack,” says a spokesperson of the fine casual American burger chain. This applies to both its outlets at Neil Road and Jewel Changi Airport. \n   \n The statement includes: “Shake Shack has put in place hand sanitisers for its staff and customers at all cashiers and throughout the Shack in both its restaurants at Jewel Changi Airport and 89 Neil Road, and increased the frequency of hand sanitisation for its employees.” \n   \n   \n “Shake Shack has also taken proactive steps to brief staff and ensure that personal hygiene is kept as the utmost priority, including daily temperature checks for supplier delivery personnel to the Shack, and all staff before they commence work.” \n 25 outlets, including Crystal Jade Palace #04-19 Takashimaya Shopping Centre, S238872. Tel: 6735-2388. www.crystaljade.com/index/  \n Many Chinese restaurants in Singapore have taken a beating from the aftermath of the COVID-19 spread. Once-difficult to book eateries are now quieter — we managed to secure seats at the last minute easily this weekend even at popular joints. Perhaps it's the perception that Chinese eateries are a hotbed for Chinese nationals — from staff to customers. But relax, The Crystal Jade group is stepping up its efforts to keep everyone safe. Its PR rep tells us it has “ensured adequate supplies of masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectant for staff’s [and customers'] use” at its restaurants.  \n Better still, the usual wet towels across all casual and fine-dining Crystal Jade outlets have been replaced with these antiseptic, antibacterial wipes (at the regular 40 cents wet towel cost, no extra charge). They may not contain the recommended virus-destroying alcohol, but at least they have disinfecting ingredients such as chlorhexidine, and is definitely better than plain old wet tissue. \n Sanitisers have also been placed at all entrances and cashier areas for customers’ use. And the group has increased the frequency of cleaning of commonly used areas such as ordering kiosks. Daily temperature checks are also taken for all staff and suppliers. \n   \n Two outlets including #01-03 Blk A Clarke Quay, S179020, Tel: 6250-9270. www.facebook.com/TsuiwahSingapore \n While the Jumbo group which owns the Singapore franchise rights to this cha chaan teng chain from Hong Kong declined to comment for this story, our friend who dined at Tsui Wah’s Clarke Quay branch recently told us that all diners had to have their temperature taken before entering the eatery. She says: “If your temperate is in the safe range, you’re given a sticker to slap onto your shirt and you're good to go (otherwise you’re turned away)”. She also mentioned that hand sanitiser is provided at the entrance, and all the wait staff wore masks. Moreover, tables are disinfected after each customer is done eating. \n 10 branches including #01-29A/52 Plaza Singapura, S238839. Tel: 6251-2000. www.timhowan.com  \n At this HK dim sum hotspot, tabletops, counters and point of sale systems are cleaned with sanitising solution four times daily — before lunch, after lunch, after tea time and post-dinner. The staff also undergoes daily temperature checks — anyone with a temp of 37.5 degrees Celsius and above, or who are unwell, must go home. Employees are also required to “wash their hands hourly”. \n #33-01 Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1, S018981. Tel: 6834-3133. www.level33.com.sg  \n What we find especially reassuring is that the menus at this craft beer brewery and Western food joint are sanitised with alcoholic solution after every guest is done flipping through it. Like their PR rep tells us, the menu is indeed an “overlooked” item — we can’t count the number of times we’ve cringed after being handed greasy, stained menus after cleaning our paws. Also: tables are sanitised with disinfectant after each use, the bar counter is cleaned every 30 minutes, so too the eatery’s toilets. We approve. And of course, hand sanitisers are distributed throughout the venue for staff and guests at the entrance, washrooms, work stations and host’s desk. Says its PR spokesperson: “As LeVeL33 is a high-volume venue, serving about 500 guests a day, they feel strongly that they have a responsibility to be vigilant and take care of guests and staff. Guests can be assured that as always, LeVeL33 is going above and beyond so that they can continue to relax and enjoy themselves as usual”. Moreover, RQAM, LeVeL33’s landlord, has set up stations for temperature screenings of all individuals before they're allowed to enter the building. \n 17 outlets, including Imperial Treasure Steamboat Restaurant #01-140 Great World City, S237994. Tel: 6235-6008. www.imperialtreasure.com \n Temperature checks are conducted for all Imperial Treasure customers before they enter each of their restaurants. Hand sanitisers are also provided at the front desk for diners to disinfect their hands (staff are also given sanitisers). Moreover, employees now undergo temperature checks twice daily.  \n Commonly used areas such as cash registers and the reception table are required to be disinfected twice a day; before every lunch and dinner service. \n Four branches including 27 Lor Liput, Holland Village, S277738. www.project-acai.com \n The 20-cent takeaway fee has been abolished for customers who prefer to tapow instead of dining in at this healthy dessert establishment. The management tells us, “since 31 January 2020, we ceased collecting our takeaway surcharge, as we felt that customers may prefer to takeaway their orders during this period (of the COVID-19 outbreak), particularly as some of our locations can get quite busy during peak periods”. \n Project Acai has also since ceased the use of communal spoon holders at all of its four outlets “to minimise the contact between different customers and clean spoons. We now give spoons (as well as straws) to customers directly when they pick up their order”. Bravo. On top of this, the usual measures like temperature-taking of staff, reminding them to sanitise hands more frequently, providing them with masks if requested, and cleansing menus, electronic devices (iPads), tables, door handles, kitchen counters, and equipment surfaces throughout the day are taken. Nice.  \n Blk 39 Malan Rd, Gillman Barracks, S109442. Tel: 6694-0807. www.nakedfinn.com  \n Artisanal seafood shack Naked Finn asks all its diners if they’ve been to China over the last 14 days — whether it’s via phone reservations or walk-ins. Anyone who says yes will be politely turned away. Also, founder Ken Loon says, “Every staff member has a bottle of hand sanitiser — we spray customers’ hands when they arrive. And wait staff also sanitise their hands every time they clear plates and before serving new dishes. After diners depart, we clean the tables and chairs with disinfectant.” Temperature checks are done on the team twice daily, while an ozone generator that purportedly purifies the air is turned on in the dining room before lunch, after lunch and after dinner. \n #04-21 Wisma Atria, S238877. Tel: 6836-0609. www.facebook.com/pages/Koh-Grill-Sushi-Bar/1723244151062370  \n While the still crowded (we saw a queue there on a recent Monday evening) casual sushi bar within the food court at Wisma Atria declined to be interviewed for this feature, we noticed its hostess, waitresses and even chefs at the sushi counter donning surgical face masks when we walked by.  \n Three outlets including #04-01 Orchard Central, S238896, Tel: 6636-5949. tanukiraw.com \n Says boss Howard Lo: “We provide hand sanitisers at each outlet for the staff and customers to use. We also conduct temperature checks for staff two times a day, and then we write down the reading and they sign next to it. If there's a customer who is unwell, our team is empowered to direct them to the nearest clinic. We have masks available for our staff, who are free to wear them if they choose to — but it’s not compulsory”. \n 10 Telok Blangah Green, S109178. Tel: 8126-8844. www.thealkaffmansion.sg  \n All the dining tables and chairs at this smart Spanish diner have been spaced further apart to increase the distance between each diner. Other measures here include temperature taking at the entrance of the restaurant and providing sanitising hand wash in all toilets, washing areas and “touchpoints”. \n "
'888888,0,The number of deaths caused by the new Coronavirus in China has increased by at least 80\'s by another 24-year-old. A new interim report by the Chinese authorities also shows that the total number of registered disease cases has now increased to more than 2.700. The previous number was still around 2.000 diseases.\nThe Chinese authorities are trying to stop the spread of the virus by means of drastic travel restrictions. In addition to the millions of metropolises of Wuhan, from where the disease wave originated, the entire central Chinese province of Hubei is now under quarantine, affecting around 56 million people. As a further measure, major events were cancelled and fever controls introduced.\nIn order to limit contact between people, China extended the holiday to Chinese New Year\'s Eve by three more days until Sunday. In Beijing, universities, schools and kindergartens remain closed for the time being beyond the end of the New Year\'s holidays. The two largest amusement parks in Hong Kong, Disneyland and Ocean Park, closed their gates. On Sunday, the trade in wild animals was also banned throughout the People\'s Republic. The Beijing authorities sent text messages to mobile phone users in the Chinese capital urging them not to shake hands to welcome them.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires\nYeah. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person\nYeah. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nThe head of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, wants to discuss measures to combat the virus at the beginning of the week during a visit to China. I\'m on my way to Beijing,"he tweeted in the shortwave service. In the Chinese capital he wanted to meet with government representatives and health experts.\nIn North America, the authorities also confirmed further cases\nYeah. According to the US health authority, there were five patients in Washington until Sunday afternoon (local time). On Sunday, two new cases were confirmed in California and one in Arizona. One of them had been confirmed by the Orange County Health Department in Los Angeles that the person had previously returned from a trip to Wuhan in China. Two other cases had already become known: a woman in the sixties in Chicago and a man in the thirties in Washington State on the West Coast in the north of the country.\nOn Saturday there was also a first "provisionally confirmed" case in Canada. In Toronto, a man came to the hospital who had also visited the Chinese region of Wuhan before.

"888888,0,Berlin (dpa/tmn) After China, due to the Coronavirus, it is unlikely that any more vacationers will travel to other Asian countries such as Thailand. With travel sickness insurance that is advisable anyway, you are on the safe side for once.\nThe protection of private travel sickness insurance was unchanged, the Association of Private Health Insurance (PKV) announced. Medical treatment for a coronavirus infection is assured.\nTravel well insured\nSuch insurance is recommended by the Association of Insurers for all foreign travel, regardless of the Coronavirus.

It recommends a tariff which ensures not only the necessary medical transport back, but also the medically sensible and justifiable.\nAround the world around 180 diseases are confirmed by the virus in two dozen countries other than China. Travelling to other Asian countries is still possible from Germany without restrictions. Although several states reject travellers from China, including foreigners, at their borders, this theoretically only applies to Germans who fly to another Asian country with a stopover in China. Lufthansa, for example, has cancelled its Chinese flights anyway.\nWash your hands and keep your fingers out of your face\nIn view of the Coronavirus, the WHO advises travellers to be particularly careful when travelling at airports or railway stations, for example. This means washing your hands regularly with soap or disinfectant. The hands should also avoid contact with eyes, nose and mouth as far as possible.\nEnjoy or cough in your own elbow or in a handkerchief. The latter should be discarded immediately afterwards and not put in the pocket\nYeah. And if you have a fever or severe cough, it's best not to leave at all.\n"
'888888,0,WASHINGTON - The United States will suspend travel from certain European countries for 30 days beginning at midnight on Friday as part of an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus.  \n - The restrictions cover people who have been in 26 European countries at any point during a 14-day period before their scheduled arrival in the United States.  \n - The targeted countries participate in Europe\'s "Schengen Area," which permits passport-free travel. The countries subject to the new restrictions are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  \n - Travelers from the United Kingdom, Ireland and more than a dozen Eastern and Southeastern Europe nations will exempted. Those countries do not participate in the Schengen Area\'s passport-free travel.  \n - The restrictions will not apply to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or to spouses, parents and children under the age of 21 of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, among other exceptions.  \n - Flights from the affected European nations will be funneled to 13 airports in the United States that serve 90 percent of existing European flights, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official. Boston Logan International Airport and Miami International Airport will be added to a list of 11 airports that have been receiving incoming flights from China and Iran since early February.  \n - At the same time, U.S. airports are cutting flights. Delta Air Lines said Friday it plans to suspend all flights to and from continental Europe for 30 days - a suspension that could start as early as Sunday.  \n - The United States is preparing for thousands of new coronavirus cases and will ask Americans returning from the affected European countries to go into self-quarantine for 14 days as part of the effort to contain the outbreak, Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday.  \n - Travelers coming from the targeted European countries will be subjected to enhanced entry screening upon arrival in the United States, DHS said in a statement on Friday. During that screening, they will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and contact information, which will be supplied to local health authorities, according to DHS. They will be given written guidance about COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and told to self-quarantine at home, the agency said.  \n - President Donald Trump\'s proclamation on Wednesday said the Schengen countries had the highest rate of coronavirus infection outside of China, and that "the free flow of people between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult."  \n - A key question is - What is to stop people from the Schengen region from traveling to the United States via Britain? Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said while Britain maintains entry and exit records for all travelers, it does not regularly share that information with the United States. But she said it can do so on a case-by-case basis upon request. REUTERS \n '

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — The Government on Wednesday (March 18) advised Singaporeans to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect, superseding an earlier travel advisory announced just three days ago to defer all non-essential travel abroad. \n The expansion of the advisory is to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being infected with the virus when they are overseas, and then spreading it to other Singaporeans when they return, the Health Ministry (MOH) said in a press release on Wednesday. \n From 11.59pm on Friday, all Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore will also be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice. \n Short-term visitors subjected to this notice have to provide proof of the place where they will be staying in for isolation. \n The extra measures for all travellers entering the country is aimed at reducing the risk of further importation leading to community spread in Singapore, it added. \n  \n The latest expansion of travel restrictions come as Singapore confirmed 47 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday— the highest single-day jump by a wide margin. \n Out of the new cases, 33 of them were imported, and 30 of them are Singapore residents who have returned from abroad, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said at a press briefing by the multi-ministry Covid-19 taskforce. \n Over the past three days, almost 70 per cent of Singapore’s new Covid-19 cases were imported, most of whom were Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning here after they had travelled overseas. \n National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who also co-chaired the briefing, said that the Government expects the number of imported cases to go up as more Singaporeans return home.\xa0 \n “Like how we flew the chartered flight back from Wuhan, a number of Singaporeans on those flights were infected and that was one city (in China). Now we have many cities all over the world in Europe where it is circulating quite quickly,” he said.\xa0 \n The recent imported cases are Singapore residents who came back one or two weeks ago, Mr Wong said.\xa0 \n He also said that the Government has decided to get people here to defer all travel because many families are away despite the earlier travel advisory urging them to defer non-essential travel.\xa0 \n “We urge everyone to reconsider any upcoming travel plans,” Mr Wong stressed.\xa0 \n As for Singapore residents who are returning before the stay-home notice kicks in on Friday for inbound travellers, Mr Wong called on them to “do the responsible thing” and consider self-isolation at their own homes for a few days or, if possible, for 14 days.\xa0\xa0 \n “If you have any symptoms, immediately go and see a doctor. It’s the responsible thing to do and the best way to protect loved ones and family members,” he added.\xa0 \n Mr Wong also said that the Ministry of Education will announce new measures to complement this new travel restriction, whereby students who have travelled with their family overseas during this period will be asked to stay at home for 14 days, even if they return before the Friday deadline.\xa0 \n EMPLOYERS TO GET APPROVAL FOR WORK PASS HOLDERS \n As for new and existing work pass holders returning to Singapore, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a statement on Wednesday that those entering Singapore from 11.59pm this Friday will need to obtain MOM’s approval before they begin their journey back. \n This applies to existing work pass holders and those who have received in-principle approval for their passes and have yet to enter Singapore. \n Employers of these work pass holders must apply for the entry approval on MOM’s website. \n They must declare to the ministry that they have arranged for suitable accommodation for these employees during the 14-day stay-home notice. \n “Employers should inform their affected employees (including their dependants) not to make travel plans to Singapore until approval has been received from MOM,” the ministry said. \n They will have to send MOM’s approval letter to the employees, who will need to show it to the airline crew upon check-in and at the border checkpoints when they arrive in Singapore. \n SPREAD OF VIRUS GAINING PACE \n MOH said that there has been a sharp increase in the number of Covid-19 cases globally, and the spread is gaining pace across the world. \n To date, there are close to 200,000 confirmed cases across 159 countries, with more than 7,900 deaths. \n “Many countries have seen an exponential rise in cases recently, and more than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the past three days. \n “Globally the number of cases and deaths has surpassed those in China since the beginning of the outbreak,” MOH stated. \n Previously announced measures to ban short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain from entering Singapore remain in effect. \n Those who are on stay-home notices would have to remain in their place of residence at all times for 14 days after entering Singapore. \n This new travel restriction will also apply to those entering Singapore via the land checkpoints from Malaysia, Mr Wong said. \n “But for people like truck drivers or others who move between Singapore and Malaysia every day, separate arrangements will have to be worked out by both countries. It doesn’t make sense to put this group under stay-home notice,” Mr Wong said at the press briefing. \n Malaysia’s nationwide lockdown, which began on Wednesday, has already imposed restrictions on the land crossings, the MOH statement read. \n Measures to provide for the many drivers driving across the Causeway to deliver goods are being discussed through ongoing bilateral discussions, Mr Wong added. \n “There is understanding that this type of to-ing and fro-ing reflects the interdependency of both countries and we need separate arrangements for that.” \n Existing measures, such as requiring all inbound travellers who exhibit fever or other symptoms of respiratory illnesses to undergo a swab test at the checkpoints, would still apply. \n '

It is clear that the threat of this pandemic is that the selfishness of the state must be forgotten for the sake of the common good. Washington has called for at least no harm to Iran and North Korea if it does not help. It is not clear whether he will accept the appeal, but it is clear that they have made a sound of reason.\nSay hello with your elbow\nIn the United States, official data showed 712 cases and 27 deaths as of Tuesday. But on Wednesday, Atlantic magazine warned: "official statistics are very low, everyone knows." According to the magazine, the problem lies in the evaluation method, first of all, the sample testers.\nAt present, it is believed that the infection known as covid-19 has spread to 35 of the 50 states in the United States and the Capital District of ColumbiaAbout This has raised serious concerns, particularly among US lawmakers, with a large proportion of older men. In addition, they often participate in community activities and shake hands with each other. Although in Washington, D.C., so-called social distance has become a pattern, including using elbows instead of contact.\nAt the end of February, many leading Republican politicians in the United States attended the traditional annual meeting of the conservative political action committee. Later, it was found that one of the guests at the event was infected with coronavirus. Moreover, according to the political daily, he is a very sociable person with access to almost all places, including the conference room, where participants wait for their turn to speak.\nSo now some of the other guests, including Senator Ted Cruz and at least five members of Congress, have announced that they will take preventive measures to segregate their families.

The leadership comfort role has made it difficult for him to find a balance between confident confidence and naive hat, "said the president\'s rival newspaper.\nBy the way, Washington Examiner, an online version of a cute white house boss, criticizes him for his lack of persuasive surface optimism. The title of the drafting commentary on this topic is "in order to prevent the panic caused by coronavirus, it is possible for French marine reserves to intensify this panic"About\nWe can recall that at the beginning, American leaders expressed their belief that with the warm weather, the spread of infection will inevitably disappear. He claimed that the threat of the epidemic was deliberately provoked by his political opponents. But when trump publicly called it the opposition\'s next scam, it met with such a strong and unanimous opposition that he no longer repeated that definition.\nOn the whole, the tension between American politicians is growing. Liz Chanet, the daughter of Congressman and former Vice President Richard Chanet, refused to attend the important retreat, Managed by the house of representatives to avoid particularly vulnerable "family members". One of her Democratic colleagues completely closed her capital office and went home to quarantine after she was found in a photo with the virus carrier on the c-pac forum.\nThe threat of this century?\nThe assessment of the US health authorities is inconsistent. They don\'t seem to have found a balance. On the one hand, of course, they can\'t underestimate the threat. On the other hand, they obviously want to emphasize that the devil is not as terrible as people portrayAbout\nAs a result, the main relevant national agency, the Centers for Disease Control（ "The virus is likely to cause a pandemic." However, he noted, "for most people, the direct risk of exposure to the virus is low.". Jerome Adams, chief surgeon of the United States, stressed that for children and young people, covid-19 "is not as lethal as flu.".\nIn this case, U.S. health authorities continue to call on healthy people not to wear masks. Although the mention of the virus is in vain, it is not very logical. If so, why keep the mask for the medical staff and staff who care for the patient? \xa0\nThe dual position of the authorities forces us to seek external assessments. Bill Gates, one of the richest people in the world, is a leading American philanthropist in the field of medicine The UK points out that the new corona rose has begun to behave quite similar to the once-in-a-century pathogens we are worried about. "\n"I hope it\'s not that bad, but before proving the opposite, we have to start from that, that is, we have to start from that." At worst, he stresseAbout Gates reported that his family philanthropy foundation is ready to spend $100 million to fight covid-19. He noted that a large part of these funds would be used to provide substantive assistance to poor countries. Because they are often the first pillar in identifying and responding to the threat of a common epidemic.\nKurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, and Thomas Wright, a political scientist at the Brooklyn Institute in Washington, D.C., also believe that covid-19 could be a century old threat. " "One of the most serious peace crises in modern history." Together with the heinous terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 and the financial collapse of 2008, they warned that the consequences of the crisis could be worse. "\nAnother example is that they put the issue primarily in a political context and proved it to be a nationalistic border as a public management approach. " Experience is important, institutions are important, the author wrote. This is a matter for the international community. An open answer, even if it\'s not welcome, makes sense. The system must be re run. "\nI\'m not the king. "\nThe sharpness of this criticism is aimed at the springboard and its main slogan: "make America great again"About In general, in the context of the discussion of the impending dangers of the United States, a typical question is now being asked more and more often - who is the culprit?\nThe most common answer can also be considered classic: Of course, it\'s easiest to prove the bureaucracy of the past. "\nLisa Monaco, a former adviser to former Democratic President Barack Obama on national security and counter-terrorism, proudly reports in a few days\' Foreign Affairs magazine, In January 2017, he personally held a simulation exercise for the new springboard team to cope with a global pandemic caused by a new virus, U.S. Defense Forces (i.e. the U.S. defense forces, which replace their subordinates on the National Security Council). The significance of reminders is understandable: we all foresee in advance that the necessary plans and structures have been established, rather than our mistakes, if they are not used.\nIn general, springboard now has many people complaining that it has dismantled the anti epidemic device built under its predecessor, which not only includes the subordinate units of the National Security Bureau, But the Department of homeland security. As early as late January, the Journal of foreign policy wrote this article, accusing the current president of "destroying his country and setting him as an example to Obama, "Ronald Klein, former chief of staff of Vice President Joseph Biden.About\nAnother thing is that the back of the head is still robust, and the effect of past measures is questionable. Klein himself said at the Aspen Institute meeting in Washington in February that despite his resounding title, he had no real impact. My experience is "King Ebola"（ "In the vast majority of cases, I\'m not the king because we don\'t have a health command system in the United States," he said\nThere is no vertical. "\nIn fact, experts generally agree that the health care structure in the United States has been and remains fragmented. There is no real "vertical authority" that can ensure a coordinated response across the country to the threat of the epidemic.

The most obvious and poignant evidence is that 27.5 million Americans lack health insurance), which is 8.5% of the population. In the 2011 postmark, the index rose again. He has been declining for several years since he passed the Obama health plan act in 2010. About\nThe question is understandable: if uninsured people start to get sick, who will pay for their treatment? The hospital warned in advance that it would be devastating for them and could lead to bankruptcy. In 2007, the Journal of health finance published a study.

'888888,0,Egypt, Algeria and South Africa are the African countries most at risk of coronavirus cases, although they are also the best prepared on the continent, according to a study published this Wednesday by the scientific journal "The Lancet".\nThe document also states that countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana and Kenya) are less prepared and therefore more vulnerable and need support to assist in the detection and treatment of cases imported from the new coronavirus (Covid-19).\n"Increased resources, vigilance and empowerment must be urgently prioritized in African countries with moderate risk of importing new cases of the disease, as these countries are estimated to be ill-prepared to detect cases and limit transmission", can be read in the note.\nThese positions are the result of a study published by The Lancet which assesses the readiness (i.e. the capacity of the health system) and the vulnerability (demographic, environmental, socio-economic and political conditions) of African countries, as well as the likelihood of importing cases of Covid-19 from China.\nNevertheless, the authors claim that these data should be interpreted in their context, because they estimate that the overall risk of importing cases from Covid-19 to Africa is lower than for Europe, but that the response and reaction capacity is more limited on the African continent.\nAlgeria, Ethiopia, South Africa and Nigeria were included in the 13th priority countries identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the basis of direct links and travel volumes to China, although the first case of Covid-19 on the continent was confirmed in Egypt, the 14th of February. China is Africa\'s main trading partner, with high volumes of travel between the two territories.\nVarious measures have already been taken to prevent cases from being imported into several African countriesYeah. However, limiting and controlling post-importation transmission requires additional measures, such as enhanced surveillance, rapid identification of suspicious cases, patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracking and monitoring.\n"Although almost three quarters of all African countries have a plan to prepare for an influenza pandemic, most are outdated and considered unsuitable for dealing with a global pandemic," stated the author of the study, Vittoria Colizza, the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and the Sorbonne University.\nThe researcher continued by saying that "despite efforts to improve the WHO\'s diagnostic capability", there are countries that "do not have the resources to test the virus quickly", meaning that the tests would need to be done in other countries.\nVittoria Colizza further noted that the consequences of recent epidemics and pandemics (Influenza H1N1 or Ebola) "highlighted the need to strengthen national public health capacities and infrastructures", because these factors are "the first line of defense in the emergence of infectious diseases" and called for the involvement of the international community.\nThe authors agree that the study has limitations, namely that they only used air travel data, and that the risk of import through other entries, such as sea ports, has not been evaluated.\nThe Covid-19 coronavirus caused dead 1.873 and infected around 73.400 people worldwide.

'888888,0,Berlin (dpa/tmn) Toys, Clothes or Pomelos- Consumers come into contact in trade with several goods from China. In view of the Coronavirus, some people are now wondering whether it can also be transmitted via food or other imported products.\nBut exaggerated fears are unfounded. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) explains that infection along this route is unlikely. According to its own information, it has received requests from unsafe consumers.\nAccording to current knowledge, the most important route of transmission is the drip infection in which the coronavirus is released from infected humans or animals into the air and then inhaled.\nIn general, according to BfR, the viruses are not particularly stable on dry surfaces. Usually they become inactive in dry state within hours to a few days. In concrete terms, this means that there is little risk that coronavirus could survive delivery from China on toys or mobile phones, for example, and infect consumers in Germany.\n'

Car makers are idling plants for lack of parts.\nThe yield curve between U.S. three-month bills and 10-year notes inverted overnight, a bearish economic signal, and German investor confidence slumped as its economy stagnates, sending the euro cheaper than $1.08 for the first time since 2017.\n“The market is trying to model itself on coronavirus and it’s struggling really hard to understand how that goes and that’s pushing capital in to the U.S.,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.\n“The U.S. remains that least-dirty T-shirt, the best house in a fairly shabby-looking neighbourhood.

'888888,0,SEOUL - President Moon Jae-in said on Monday he was increasingly confident South Korea would overcome the coronavirus as the rate of new infections continued to drop, although authorities noted another large cluster had emerged in the greater Seoul area.  \n There were 74 new coronavirus infections reported on Monday, down from 76 on Sunday and marking the second day in a row that the number has been below 100. That is well below a Feb. 29 peak of 909.  \n South Korea has 8,236 confirmed infections - the highest number in Asia outside China - while the death toll rose by four to 79, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  \n Another 303 patients had been released after recovering, bringing the number of those who had gone home to 1,137.  \n "Unless there are unexpected developments, we expect this trend will also gain momentum," Moon said during a meeting with health officials at Seoul City Hall. "Our confidence that we can overcome COVID-19 is growing."  \n Both Moon and other officials warned against complacency - their remarks coming on the same day that the central bank, in a bid to soften the economic impact of the virus, cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in an emergency meeting, taking it below 1% for the first time ever.  \n "For three straight days we have seen more numbers of discharged than newly confirmed, but we should not forget the lessons we’ve learned," Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing.  \n There were new clusters from unknown sources in cities other than the hardest hit city of Daegu, Kim said, adding: "This implies the coronavirus is spreading across the country."  \n In Seongnam, south of Seoul, at least 46 members of a Protestant church have tested positive, including the pastor, after services on March 1 and March 8, despite government calls to cancel mass gatherings.  \n "We have traced 46 confirmed patients linked to the church in Seongnam city since March 9. We are still investigating who those patients had contact with," KCDC chief Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters.  \n Forty other people who came in contact with infected church members also tested positive, he said, noting the cluster was the second-largest in the Seoul metropolitan area.  \n Kim urged people to avoid mass gatherings and adopt "social distancing" measures. "We should not let our guard down."  \n This week, South Korea adopted tougher border checks for visitors from Europe, similar to its rules for travellers from China and Iran.  \n The foreign ministry on Monday escalated its travel advisory level for 36 countries in Europe from 1 to 2, the second of four ratings, asking citizens to refrain from travel to the region.

'888888,0,WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sharpened on Thursday his criticism of China’s handling of a coronavirus pandemic, saying its ruling Communist Party was still denying the world information needed to prevent further cases.\nThe remarks, in an interview with the Washington Watch radio program, provoked a riposte from China that Pompeo should cease “politicizing” the epidemic and defaming the country.\nPompeo had repeated previous charges that Beijing’s delay in sharing information about the virus had created risks to people worldwide that had “truly put thousands of lives at risk.”\n“My concern is that this cover-up, this disinformation that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in, is still denying the world the information it needs so that we can prevent further cases or something like this from recurring again,” he added.\nPompeo also accused Iran and Russia of waging disinformation campaigns about the virus.\n“The disinformation campaign from Russia and Iran as well as China continues,” he said. “They’re talking about it coming from the U.S. Army and they’re saying maybe it began in Italy, all things to deflect responsibility.”\nDespite his strong criticism of China, Pompeo refrained from referring to the virus as the “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus,” labels that have angered Beijing and which he has used repeatedly.\n“The time will come for recriminations,” he said, but added it was important for the world to know what was really going on.\n“This is an ongoing global crisis, and we need to make sure that every country today is being transparent, sharing what’s really going on, so that the global community, the global health care, infectious disease community can begin to work on this in a holistic way.”\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had been transparent and shared information with the World Health Organization and other countries, including the United States.\n“We urge the U.S. to cease politicizing the epidemic, and cease attacking and defaming China,” Geng told a daily news conference.\nPompeo, a persistent critic of Beijing and the Communist Party, said “very important decisions” would have to be made in future about how the U.S.-China relationship was structured.\nHe added that supply-chain challenges faced in the United States were due to companies “operating their supply chains out of China but not here in the United States.”\nPompeo did not elaborate, but U.S. officials said last week the White House was preparing an executive order to help relocate medical supply chains from China and elsewhere overseas to the United States amid the pandemic.\nThe proposed U.S. push has sparked concern in China and elsewhere, although it is unclear when Trump might act.\nThe United States “should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival,” Trump said at a daily briefing of his coronavirus task force.\n“Our goal for the future must be to have American medicine for American patients, American supplies for American hospitals...”\n(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser.)\n'

'888888,0,WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.  As an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nIn a statement to Reuters, the U.S. CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\n“CDC has had a 30-year partnership with China CDC and close collaboration,” the statement said. “We had the right staff to engage China and ability to provide technical assistance were it requested.”\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have had made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)said Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,”  the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move.  “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. Coronavirus is not influenza, though it is a respiratory disease.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people. Nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

All options would be open when OPEC+ meets in Vienna in March, he said\n.  \n Brent crude oil prices dropped by nearly 14% since a spike in tensions between the United States and Iran took prices to a closing high above $68 a barrel on Jan. 6.  \n The losses since are in spite of a fall in production from Libya by 75% to less than 300,000 barrels per day because of an ongoing blockade on oilfields.  \n "Investor fears on oil demand have risen considerably, driven by unfavorable U.S. inventories and ... concerns on impact from the coronavirus outbreak," Goldman Sachs said in a note.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Map showing places with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B589312/coronavirus-map.jpg) REUTERS\n'
'888888,0,BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Residents of China’s Hubei province, where the new coronavirus outbreak was first reported, will be banned from entering Hong Kong from Monday as China tries to halt the rapid spread of the outbreak.\nChina’s Cabinet also announced it will extend the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 and schools will return from their break later than usual, state broadcaster CCTV said.\nHealth authorities around the world are racing to prevent a pandemic of the virus, which has infected more than 2,000 people in China and killed 56.\nA handful of cases of infection have been reported in other countries, including Thailand, Australia, the United States,  France and Canada. No fatalities have been recorded outside China.\nThe mayor of Wuhan, which is the capital of Hubei province and at epicenter of the outbreak, said he expected another 1,000 new patients in the city, which was stepping up construction of special hospitals.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\nChina’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, during which infection can occur.\nThe Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally celebrated by hundreds of millions of Chinese traveling around the country and abroad to see family, began on Friday but has been severely disrupted by the outbreak.\nMa said China would intensify its containment efforts, which have so far included transport and travel curbs and cancellation of big events.\nThe virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai\n.\nAlibaba’s Taobao online marketplace said it has removed sales of face masks from shops that show “unstable prices or false advertising”, as prices for the products surged.\nThe World Health Organization this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic.\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was on his way to Beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus.\nChinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has six confirmed cases, will also ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, the city’s government said. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents.\nHubei’s governor, Wang Xiaodong, said on Sunday he felt “agonized” and responsible for the outbreak. He described the situation as severe and said medical supplies were still tight.\nChina confirmed 2,051 cases of infection as of 7 p.m. (1100 GMT) on Jan. 26, while the death toll from the virus remained at 56, state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts.\nHealth officials in Orange County, California, said a third case had been registered in the United States in a traveler from Wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition.\nOn Sunday, China temporarily banned nationwide the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Wild and often poached animals packed together in Chinese markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans.\nThe New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society called on China to make the ban permanent.\nThe U.S. State Department said it will relocate personnel at its Wuhan consulate to the United States, while Japan was working with China to arrange a charter flight for Japanese nationals to return from Wuhan\n. Around 50 Italians in Wuhan and the Hubei region were offered transport out.\nThe outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within China, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown and  transport links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles.\nHealth authorities in Beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. The advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on Sunday morning.\nBeijing also postponed the reopening of the city’s schools and universities after the Lunar New Year holiday, state radio reported. Hong Kong had already delayed the reopening of schools to Feb. 17.\nChina has called for transparency in managing the crisis,  after public trust was eroded by a cover-up of the spread of  SARS, a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.\nBut officials in Wuhan have been criticized for their handling of the current outbreak.\n“People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,” said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located.\nIllustrating the extent of disruption to life in China, overall passenger travel declined by nearly 29% on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, from a year earlier, with air passengers down nearly 42%, a transportation ministry official said.\nMany cinemas across China were closed and cruise ship operators canceled some sailings that had been due to leave Chinese ports.\nIn Hong Kong, Disneyland and Ocean Park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily over the holiday, has already closed.\n(GRAPHIC: Spread of the new coronavirus - here)\n'
'888888,0,Thailand\'s Grand Motorcycle Award, scheduled for the 22nd March, was postponed this Monday due to the new coronavirus, one day after the start of the World MotoGP Race in Qatar, was cancelled.\n"We must first concentrate on the pandemic. We must postpone the race today until further notice,"said the Thai Deputy Prime Minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, also in charge of the health portfolio.\nMotoGP from Thailand takes place in the Buriram circuit (centre).\nSeveral teams that compete in the world championship for speed motorcycling, in which the Portuguese Miguel Oliveira participate, are Italian, such as Ducati and Aprilia, as well as many drivers, such as Andrea Dovizioso, Danilo Petrucci, Francesco Bagnaia, Valetino Rossi and Franco Morbidelli.\nOn Sunday, the championship organization had already announced the cancellation of the MotoGP World Cup opening race, scheduled for Qatar, due to the Covid-19 epidemic.\nThe decision affected only the queen category at the Qatar Grand Prix, explained to Dorna, the promotion company of the championship, in a statement, also signed by the International Motorcycle Federation (FIM) and the team association.\nThe lower classes, Moto2 and Moto3, should be held as scheduled, as the teams were already in that Middle East country due to the pre-season tests that took place there during the weekend.\n"The Qatar authorities won\'t let anyone into the country who travels from Italy. We have been trying everything for the last hour, but it has not been possible,"explained the president of FIM, the Portuguese Jorge Viegas, in statements to the Lusa agencyYeah.\nQatar has decided to quarantine for 14 days all passengers from Italy or who have been in that transalpine country in the last two weeks: "This way, there can be no race", noted Jorge Viegas, because six of the 22nd championships are Italian, as well as many of the elements that make up the various teams.\n"They closed Qatar to people from China, Iran, Korea and Italy", explained the FIM\'s top official, believing that the losses resulting from this decision will be "mainly sporting".\nAlso in Formula 1, the Chinese Grand Prix has already been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe Covid-19 epidemic, which originated in China in December 2019, has already infected more than 86 thousand people in 53 countries of five continents, of which about three thousand died.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak an international public health emergency and increased the risk to "very high".'
'888888,0,ANN ARBOR, Michigan: Work has begun at multiple organisations, including the United States’ National Institutes of Health, to develop a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, known among scientists as 2019-nCoV. \n Scientists are just getting started, but their vaccine development strategy will benefit both from work that has been done on closely related viruses, as well as advances that have been made in vaccine technologies. \n For instance, nucleic acid vaccines, which are DNA- and RNA-based vaccines, can produce the vaccine antigen in the patient’s own body. \n DEVELOPING VACCINES FOR VIRUSES \n While scientists have not been working on a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus prior to the outbreak, work has been ongoing for other closely related coronaviruses that have caused severe disease in humans, namely MERS and SARS. \n Scientists had not been concerned about this particular strain, as they did not know that it existed and could cause disease in humans until the outbreak. \n Work on vaccines for severe coronaviruses has historically begun once the viruses start infecting humans. \n Developing a vaccine involves designing the vaccine constructs – for example, producing the right target antigens, viral proteins that are targeted by the immune system, followed by testing in animal models to show that they are protective and safe. \n Once safety and efficacy are established, vaccines can advance into clinical trials in humans. If the vaccines induce the expected immune response and protection and are found safe, they can be mass produced for vaccination of the population. \n WHAT MORE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A VACCINE \n Currently, we lack virus isolates – or samples of the virus – to test the vaccines against. We also lack antibodies to make sure the vaccine is in good shape. \n  \n We need the virus in order to test if the immune response induced by the vaccine works. \n We would also have to establish what animals to test the vaccine on. That potentially could include mice and nonhuman primates. Vaccine development will also likely take months. \n DEALING WITH FUTURE OUTBREAKS \n We expect that these types of outbreaks will occur for the foreseeable future in irregular intervals. \n To try to prevent large outbreaks and pandemics, we need to improve surveillance in both humans and animals worldwide as well as invest in risk assessment, allowing scientists to evaluate the potential threat of detected viruses. \n Given that this is the third major outbreak of a new coronavirus that we have had in the past two decades and the severity of the resulting diseases such as MERS and SARS, we should consider investing in the development of a vaccine that would be broadly protective against these viruses. \n We believe that global action is needed to invest in novel vaccine approaches that can be employed quickly whenever a new virus like the current coronavirus – and also viruses similar to Zika, Ebola or influenza – emerges. \n Currently, responses to emerging pathogens are mostly reactive, meaning they start after the outbreak happens. We need a more proactive approach supported by continuous funding. \n Aubree Gordon is Professor of Public Health at the University of Michigan.

'888888,0,On this Friday, the German Red Cross (DRC) is expecting more travellers from the Chinese town of Wuhan, which is particularly affected by the Coronavirus, in Stuttgart.\nThe DRC takes over the care on behalf of the federal government, said a spokesman for the relief organisation on Thursday in Berlin. A spokesman for the Baden-Wuttemberg Ministry of Social Affairs said the health authorities were prepared for the arrival of the people. Initially, the Southwest Round had reported on this.\nAccording to information from the German Press Agency, more than a dozen people are to fly to Stuttgart. They first arrive in Paris with other Europeans in a French plane and are expected in the morning at Stuttgart airport. After their arrival, the travellers are to be examined and then probably taken to a quarantine station in the district of Esslingen.\nThe DRC had already operated a quarantine station in Germersheim (Rhineland-Palatinate) to which the first German returnees from Wuhan on the 1st. February had come. At the moment, it still handles passengers on a later return flight to Berlin.\nOutside mainland China, more than ten Covid-19 deaths have now been recorded, with dozens of people in critical condition. Covid-19 is the disease caused by the new Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2.\nIn South Korea, the number of infections recorded doubled by 53 to 104 within one day. A man died in a hospital in the southeastern city of Cheongdo, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of the new cases were reported from Daegu and the province of North Gyeongsang. Authorities suspect that many of those affected were infected with Sars-CoV-2 when they visited the divine service of a Christian sect in Daegu. Around 2,5 million people live in DaegYeah. Concerned about the uncontrolled spread of the virus, they should stay home for the time being.\nThe extent of possible infections in Iran was still unclear. Two Covid-19 deaths had been reported in the city of Ghom on Wednesday; no infection had previously been reported in the country. It\'s supposed to be two older men. According to authorities, the persons concerned had not been outside their home town of Ghom. They also had no contact with Chinese tourists. According to the Ministry of Health, there are also three other proven infections in the country. All schools and universities in Ghom were provisionally closed, as reported by IRNA. The almost 1,2 million inhabitants of Ghom should avoid physical contact.\nMeanwhile, China has again changed the number of confirmed infections. As the Health Commission said, clinical diagnoses should no longer be included as confirmed cases in the statistics. The severely affected province of Hubei, where the virus had broken out, had only last week begun to count such diagnoses. Physicians determine the disease based on lung images and the physical condition. Now, once again, only DNA tests in the lab are to be considered.\nThe official statistics recorded until Thursday around 75.000 infections and more than 2100 deaths in the country. Experts, however, have long been expecting a much higher dark figure. Even a Chinese scientist is now questioning whether the epidemic can still be stopped and the virus disappears again. Covid-19 could become an established disease like the flu, said Wang Chen, president of the China Academy of Medical Science, on state televisioYeah.\nAccording to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, two clinical trials are under way in China to treat patients. Provisional results should be expected in three weeks. Among other things, the trial included medicines against the AIDS agent HIV.\nIn Japan, two passengers of the cruise ship Diamond Princess were killed by the new Coronavirus. It was already known that more than twenty of the patients infected with Sars-CoV-2 were seriously ill. Now an 84-year-old Japanese woman and an 87-year-old Japanese woman died, as the Japanese television station NHK reported. The cruise ship had been under quarantine for two weeks with a passenger after being identified. Among the original 3700 passengers and crew members, 634 infections were detected until Thursday. All those affected came to hospitals.\nPassengers who tested negative for the virus, like the previous day, had more than 500 people on board. An Italian returnee with around twenty Italians and as many other Europeans should land in Germany, among other things. Passengers who could return to their home country include four with German nationality and two of their spouses. A couple want to stay in Japan first, two more Germans are proven to be infected and are treated in a Japanese clinic.\nSome visitors were expected from the "Diamond Princess" in Berlin: "There will probably be a landing in Tegel this Saturday, again in the military part, because two Berliners are among the passengers," said Health Senator Dilek Kalayci. The plan was to isolate them at home for a fortnight. Those who do not live in Berlin are then first brought by DRK staff to their hometowYeah.\nOn the way home, passengers of the cruise ship Westerdam, with which 57 Germans had also landed a few days ago, remained in Cambodia. According to the Ministry of Health of North Rhine-Westphalia, ten people from the Federal Republic were on board. Six of them are already home. According to the Recklinghausen district, the remaining four passengers will land this Friday by plane in Dusseldorf. The two couples from Dorsten and Recklinghausen are to be quarantined at home. Except for one American, the Sars-CoV-2 virus has so far not been detected in any of the people on Westerdam. (dpa'
'888888,0,Coronavirus outbreak has hit the economies hard, wiping out a major chunk of global wealth due to shutdowns, bans and investor concerns. India Today TV spoke to former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan to understand the extent of the possible impact of coronavirus outbreak on the Indian economy and what can be done to minimise the shock.\nExtent of economic shock \nThe extent of impact of novel coronavirus is the big unknown at the moment but it will be severe, Raghuram Rajan said. "The extent of its impact is a big unknown right now. How long it will take to get it under control, how much GDP will be lost in the process, and how much can be recovered when the restrictive measures are taken off it is all unknown at the moment," Raghuram Rajan said.\nThe former RBI governor said that much depends on what happens next in China. "With relaxations in place due to drop in the number of cases, everyone is looking at China to see if there are recurrences because if that happens then it means measures have to be in place longer and damages could be much larger," he said.\nThe economic expert said that the length of the coronavirus outbreak and recurrences could be the difference between depression and recession.\nFor now, China has lost around 10 per cent of its GDP in the first quarter and the projections for the United States and European countries say that they will end up losing a similar percentage of their GDP in the second quarter, he said.\nRaghuram Rajan, who is currently at the University of Chicago, said that one of the possible outcomes of the coronavirus outbreak could be the severe reduction in the global supply chains.\n"It is a little early to say which direction it will take, of course, it is a huge unprecedented event. It could lead to countries being wary to having supply chains across the borders because they know they cant rely on them. But the other outcome is it can bring the world together knowing that we have to deal with such huge global challenges, may make us more aware that we need to deal with climate change," Raghuram Rajan told India Today TV\'s Rahul Kanwal.\nWhat can the Indian government do to minimise economic shock\nOrganise medical resources\nAccording to Raghuram Rajan, while saving larger business was crucial for the Indian economy, but the first priority for the government must be organising medical resources to fight the novel coronavirus.\n"We need to prioritise. We must focus on buying ventilators, masks, getting protective equipment for our doctors and nurses so that they can do their jobs, and that means bringing every resource in whether it is private, public, retired, defence... get everything in on the act," he said.\n"The government must gather all the resources and point them where they are needed the most. We need to find out where are the masks, where are the ventilators, where is the spare hospital capacity," Raghuram Rajan said.\nOn being asked about the absence of the global supply of medical resources, the ex-RBI chief said that Centre will have to use all the tricks in the book to acquire what is available in the international market.\n"In the immediate context, we need to find the necessary supply wherever we can find, even if we have to cajole or push. Since every country is trying to do that, we need to use every way we can to apply pressure and bring-in all that we need," Raghuram Rajan said, adding that beyond the current scenario, the crisis raises the question on if we are self-sufficient for critical resources. "But that\'s a medium-term issue," he said.\nIncome support for poor \nRaghuram Rajan said that the second most crucial thing for the government right now should be to ensure that money is put into the hands of the poor.\n"The key is to make sure that the temporary shock does not become a more permanent shock. In other words, we must not have slow cash flows, no revenue, no income for workers, as that would lead to substantial lays offs, and that would lead to firms closing down and when the measures are withdrawn there will be a much less economic activity," he said.\nSuggesting a way out, the ex-RBI chief said that the government must build income bridges between now and the time when the restrictive measures will be lifted.\n"We need bridges between now and then, for the most vulnerable households in India - for the poor, for migrants, we need ways to get money to them. But we also need to keep firms alive, firms which have suffered shock aftershock, we need to keep them from closing down, if they are viable. And that decision is a careful one because we can\'t keep every firm alive given that we have limited resources but we should keep the viable ones alive so that they can reopen, similarly for the large firms," he said.\nDismissing the idea that the Indian government should mull rolling out a universal minimum wage to solve the problem, the economic expert said that the government cannot be thinking about long-term measures at the moment.\n"Temporary income support is possible but beyond that, we don\'t have the money. This is not the time to discuss universal basic income," he said.\nInfuse liquidity \nRaghuram Rajan said that the Indian financial system was an impaired financial system which was evident from the fact that the \'central bank is currently unable to provide credit support to businesses\'.\n"The government should provide partial guarantees to make sure banks continue lending to small and medium business enterprises and to large businesses, but we have to be careful as we have limited fiscal space so there has to be some incentive for the banks to also to take credit risk into account," Raghuram Rajan suggested.\nRajan said that the RBI should take a cue from the central banks across the world which are contributing to solving the problem by easing liquidity. "Liquidity should not be a constraint, instead the central bank should be helping in credit," he said, adding that credit will have to distributed with caution so that India\'s staggering NPAs do not rise further.\nCommunicate clearly \nThe ex-RBI chief urged the Indian government to communicate with the public clearly that it is a national emergency. "People must know that it is something that is affecting everyone," he said.\n"If it has not happened to you right now, does not mean it won\'t happen to you tomorrow," Raghuram Rajan said, adding that the people must be encouraged to follow the protocol for the safety strictly.\nAdditionally, he asked the government to issue correct and detailed data of infections across the country so that timely interventions can be introduced.\n"India needs to step up testing and do mass testing and release the data so that state governments can intervene and provide solutions," Raghuram Rajan said.\nAlert young crowd \nRaghuram Rajan said that the most common problem across the globe was that young people were not taking the problem seriously. They are assuming that they are not at risk, but they could be the carriers, he said.\n"India must make sure that young people are alert and aware of the risks of possible transmission disease. Everyone must be encouraged to follow good hygiene habits to ensure the curb on the spread of the disease.\nParts of India go under lockdown\nThe central and state governments on Sunday announced lockdown in about 80 districts in the country where at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported.\nThe districts where lockdown was announced include 10 districts each in Maharashtra and Kerala, six districts each in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, five each in Karnataka and Haryana, three each in Tamil Nadu and Punjab.\nMeanwhile, S&P Global Ratings on Monday cut its estimate for India\'s GDP growth for the next fiscal to 5.2 per cent from its earlier estimate of 6.5 per cent, which further worsened the market sentiment that has been already reeling under the coronavirus spread.\nIn the global market, bourses in China, Hong Kong and South Korea plunged up to 5 per cent, while those in Japan ended on a positive note. Bourses in Europe sank up to 4 per cent.\nThe number of global Covid-19 infections has shot past 3,00,000. Worldwide fatalities topped 14,000. Cases in India spiked to 480 with at least nine deaths.\n'

'888888,0,BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n“My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don’t get any new answers,” Zhang told Reuters. “Every time the responses are the same: ‘There’s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what’s going on.’ The doctors are all very frustrated too.”\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travelers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan’s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters\n. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being “rumor spreaders.”\n“The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,” a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. “I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.”\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some “loopholes” in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognized that “all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.” But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n“In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I’m authorized,” he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested\n.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, “You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. “We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,” he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n“We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,” he told Reuters. “Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.”\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China’s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people\n.\n“The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus’s genome, building new hospitals at a moment’s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,” said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan’s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is “impossible to conduct the test right away,” an official at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n“Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn’t be able to be treated,” the worker told Reuters. “The actual deaths were higher.”\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker’s account\n. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu’s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city’s health authorities.\n“All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,” said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. “At least if it’s confirmed we have a direction. If there’s no direction, there’s no hope.”\n'

'888888,0,BANGKOK — A Thai man has died from complications doctors say were due to the deadly Covid-19 coronavirus, though health officials were reluctant Monday (March 2) to conclusively confirm the cause of his death. \n The 35-year-old was diagnosed with dengue fever in January before doctors detected the virus two weeks later and transferred him to Bamrasnaradura Hospital, where many confirmed coronavirus patients are being treated. \n He tested negative for Covid-19 by Feb 16 but the lung infection had caused multiple organ failure and — despite receiving anti-viral treatment — the man passed away Saturday, disease control officials said. \n But health officials on Monday pushed back against classifying the man\'s death as a coronavirus fatality. \n "We are not hiding information as the reason (for his death) is not urgent," said health ministry spokesman Thaweesin Wissanuyothin during Monday\'s daily press briefing. \n "We will announce it when the result is clear and formal," he added. \n If confirmed, the death will be Thailand\'s first from the Covid-19 coronavirus. \n The country currently has a total of 43 confirmed cases. Thirty-one people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals. \n The bulk of the confirmed cases were Chinese visitors or Thais who worked in the tourism sector. \n The 35-year-old man who died was a consultant for a duty-free store frequented by tourists, near Bangkok\'s Suvarnabhumi International Airport. \n Retail giant King Power, which sub-contracts the company that owned the store, said in a statement Sunday the branch where the man worked has been temporarily closed since Feb 6. \n Thailand\'s tourism sector — heavily reliant on Chinese tourists — has been hit hard by the virus, which originated from a city in central China.

'888888,0,BEIJING, March 16 (Reuters) - China tentatively plans to hold its delayed annual gathering of parliament in late April or early May, two people involved in preparations told Reuters, as new coronavirus cases in the country drop sharply even as they surge elsewhere.\nThe annual meetings of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), known as the “two sessions”, were scheduled for early March but were delayed due to the virus outbreak, with no new date announced.\nHolding the events, which typically draw a combined 5,000 delegates to Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, would be a major indication that the Chinese leadership sees things as returning to normal.\nThe State Council Information Office and the media department of the Standing Committee of the NPC did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment on Monday.\nThe outbreak that originated in the central city of Wuhan has infected more than 80,000 people in the country, killed 3,200 and wreaked economic havoc, causing factory output to plunge at the sharpest pace in three decades.\nThe NPC’s timing is not finalised, and one of the people said the number of attendees may be reduced, with those visiting from outside Beijing needing to undergo quarantine.\nPeople now arriving in the capital from elsewhere in China must spend two weeks in quarantine.\n“We still have to play it by ear, as the coronavirus rapidly spreads across the world,” said the person, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.\nThe NPC, China’s parliament, usually sits for at least 10 days.

'888888,0,This Wednesday, the blockade that has lasted more than two months around Hubei Province is lifted, but in its capital, Wuhan, where the pandemic of the new coronavirus has begun, the quarantine remains strict until April 8th. This is another step in the appeal and gradual authorisation to return to normality made a week ago by the authorities of the country that was the epicentre of the pandemic and wants to regain its economy. But although there are more people on the street, factories resuming work and even some traffic jams and open-air cinemas, the new normal is technologically controlled, raises doubts from experts and is still shy.\nFor the 60 million inhabitants of Hubei, the end of the draconian quarantine depends on the health test of each citizen. And this proof is the "green code" that appears in the application of the Health Code mobile phone, which has become almost ubiquitous and potentially omnipotent, As alerted by the New York Times at the beginning of the month. You may also be sharing personal data and location with the police, increasing control of China over its citizens, and is essential to circulate in many parts of the country. The application categorizes each Chinese citizen (or immigrant) according to their state of health.\nAvailable via popular services such as WeChat or Alipay (and associated with the Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba), has been used as an expedient to control the Chinese population in their gigantic containment operation during the epidemic; now, it remains a condition to enter office buildings, transport It is also a very concrete symbol of the concern that some residents have shown for what lies in the aftermath of the den-19: greater and growing control of the state over its citizensYeah.\nThe Chinese draconian operation to contain the new coronavirus has been in the field for about eight weeks now that official numbers say there are hardly any new cases originating in China itself, the government\'s message is that the big threat is imported cases. And China has won the fight and is returning to normal. The Chinese President, Xi Jinping, called "urgent" for the leaders of his government and the Chinese Communist Party to resume productivity and daily life in regions considered to be low-risk. Economic prosperity is one of the validation tools of the Chinese Government.\n"The productive Chinese factories are steaming to stabilize the world\'s supply chains", titled the official website of the government of Xi Jinping a few days ago. A week ago, Al-Jazira realized that cities with strong corporate fabric, like Guangzhou and Shenzhen, were calling the workers back to the factories. On Monday, there was talk again of traffic jams in Beijing and European Space Agency satellites have already detected an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, pollution mainly from industry activity in China.\nAl-Jazira also reported that provincial students with "low risk of infection", such as Guizhou, Qinghai, Tibet and Xinjiang, were returning to classes; the Guardian reported the same at the end of last week, observing the return of students from outside the capital to Beijing, with the most crowded trains and the most compound rides. In Hubei, schools will remain closed. And, as the correspondent of Time magazine in Shanghai, office buildings reopen, but without air conditioning to avoid contamination, taxis circulate but have plastics to separate them from customers and foreigners ar e more subject to security and police questions when walking down the street.\nEach Chinese province has its own rules and travel between some of them may still require two weeks of quarantine, for examplYeah. On the other hand, Chinese television already had entertainment again and on the 13th day Apple reopened its 42 shops in China after a month of closure. It is just one of many chains, restaurants or bars that have once again received customers, but under rules that remain tight. Body temperature is controlled at the door, there are limits on the number of people sitting at table and in the case of the 44KW nightclub in Shanghai, the Health Code application is essential in order to be able to enter; the Guardian reports that foreigners have to show their passport by listing the countries they have gone through. And if more than 500 cinemas have reopened until Monday, it should be noted that they are only five% of the vast Chinese exhibition market, which are in low-central provinces and which are showing old films, and, above all, few spectators are still likely to enter.\nAs regards this new Chinese phase after the peak of the den-19 apparently passed, there are still experts who are doubtful. It is not so much feared that there will be a second wave of cases in the country as that this alleviating of restrictions will make Chinese society vulnerable again, There are reports in the press (such as in reputed Caixin magazine) and on social networks of alleged cases of people with no symptoms or announcements of new cases in Wuhan that are not being made public, for example. The Wuhan authorities, reporting from China, deny, but confidence in central and local power has been shaken since the country\'s initial management of the coronavirus crisis.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\n"It is likely that the number of cases will increase once control measures are relieved. This means that they will have to remain vigilant for a new outbreak of cases and decide how to respond,"says Jennifer Nuzzo, epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, cited by the GuardiaYeah. Malik Peiris, who was in charge of Virology from the University of Hong Kong to the New York Times, said Tuesday, "to impose these measures again (isolation of the population), if necessary in the future".\nVictor Shih, professor of politics at the University of California, adds another perspective on the potential to recreate the disease, based on the relative credibility of the numbers of the Chinese authorities and of what is happening in the hospitals of the country. "One way to resume economic activity without panic is to cover up cases, while the government does its best to identify and contain them,"he said to the Guardian on Monday. "There is a risk of this leading to another outbreak, but for now it seems to be a risk that the government is willing to take."\nIn Wuhan, on Monday small groups of inhabitants began to leave their homes, timidly.

'888888,0,(Reuters) - Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU.O) beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly results on Thursday, lifted by strong holiday season demand, but the athletic apparel maker did not provide a full-year forecast as the coronavirus outbreak fuels uncertainty.\nShares of the Vancouver-based company fell about 3% after the closing bell.\nThe company is seeing stay-at-home consumers buying more yoga mats and blocks, Chief Executive Officer Calvin McDonald told analysts on a post-earnings call, but online growth has not been enough to counter volumes lost from the store closures.\nIn China, where Lululemon operated nearly 40 stores, the company has already reopened most stores except one in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, which is expected to open next week.\nThe company said it is planning for stores in North America to be closed for longer than they were in China.\nLululemon, which has been streaming its popular yoga classes on social media following the store closures, said it would consider redeploying some of those marketing dollars to drive its online business.\n“We know that initially, the business will be lower than it was pre-COVID-19 but we believe that each day and each week, it will keep building,” McDonald said.\nGabriella Santaniello, founder of retail consulting firm A Line Partners, said Lululemon’s efforts to stream yoga classes online and their ability to build a sense of community among customers would be an advantage as it looks to weather the hit from the health crisis.\n“Lululemon started as a yoga company and you can actually do yoga inside!”\nLike all retailers, the Canadian company has shut its stores across the world and focused on selling through its online platform as authorities clamp down on travel and lockdown cities to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19.\n“We are planning for multiple scenarios,” McDonald added, without providing more details.\nStrong digital sales had also helped larger rival Nike Inc (NKE.N) beat estimates for its third-quarter and the company also held back from providing an outlook for its current-quarter.

'888888,0,The new Coronavirus threatens the German economy massively. The industry expects a "stress test" and fears "noticeable negative effects". Stocks are slipping into the basement.\nIn an already weakened economic situation in Germany, lung disease threatens to become a "real economic inhibitor", warns the Chamber of Industry and Commerce on Thursday. Already now, the internationally strongly networked German export industry is feeling that the Coronavirus is burdening global trade and companies have been holding back their investment projects in many locations.\nFederal Minister of Economy Peter Altmaier (CDU) did not rule out that the Coronavirus could have "foreseeable effects" on the previous growth forecasts.\n"The spread of the Coronavirus will significantly affect the German economy this year," said DIHK chief of foreign economics Volker Treier. "Production failures at Chinese and German companies in China, massive travel restrictions and trade breaks between China and Asian neighboring countries, as well as demand failures in tourism and retail are likely scenarios that can affect the economy also in Germany and Europe."\nAltmeier said the Ministry of Economic Affairs was determined to act calmly and calmly. He does not expect large-scale supply bottlenecks. However, uncertainty in the economy had increased. Altmaier envisioned a counter-tax from the Federal Government in the event of a massive expansion of the Coronavirus affecting the economy.\nGerman and other foreign companies operating in China are already struggling. The German and European Chambers of Commerce in China concluded that the overall impact is bad following a survey among member companies. Almost 90-percent reported "moderate to severe effects" due to lung diseasYeah. "Everyone is affected," says the chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce in North China, Stephan Wollenstein, in Beijing.\nEach second company would have to correct the business objectives for the year. Thus, almost half of the companies expect a two-digit percentage drop in revenue in the first half of the year. A quarter even expects more than 20 percent decline. A good third already have problems with their finances today. "People do not make money by selling something, but have to pay rent and wages at the same time," said Wollenstein.\nIt is precisely small and medium-sized enterprises that are suffering from lung disease. "Some of them already have to fight to hold on," said the head of the European Chamber of Commerce, Jurg Wuttke. The crisis could last longer than expected, as the head of the expert commission of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said. He expects the epidemic in China to be "largely under control by the end of April".\nUnfortunately, the virus is still spreading in Europe. The fear is that, as in Beijing, the international car fair will now be cancelled in Geneva, for example, in April. The otherwise travelled Germans are uncertain, hesitating with their holiday plans. "The longer the crisis persists, the more the travel industry will be affected," said Norbert Fiebig, president of the DRV branch association in Frankfurt.\n"The uncertainty about the effects of the virus is great," said BDI chief manager Joachim Lang in Berlin. China is the largest German trading partner. Now, economic crisis management by the federal government is also required. "The effects of the virus are clearly visible in the global economy and the export-oriented German industry." The Chinese companies worked under pressure to reduce dependencies and minimise concentration risksYeah.\nThe immediate challenges for companies in China are, first of all, unpredictable regulations, quarantine requirements and extensive conditions for restarting operations after the extended break since the Chinese New Year\'s Festival. "The patchwork of conflicting regulations that the fight against Covid-19 has produced hundreds of different areas of power that make it almost impossible to move goods or people in China," said EU Chamber President Wuttke.\n"China is facing a delicate balancing act with two important but divergent objectives: to rigorously maintain measures to prevent the virus while fighting for a return to economic normality," said contraart Wollenstein. China\'s government should support particularly small and medium-sized enterprises until business returns to normal.\nMore than half of the companies are complaining of a contraction in demand. "The market stalled," said Wollenstein. For example, according to the Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the car market in China decreased by 20 percent in January compared to the previous month. This is also due to the fact that there were fewer sales days due to the New Year\'s Eve, said VDA President Hildegard Muller.\nMoreover, according to Wollenstein, due to the interruption of logistics delivery deadlines could not be met (47 percent). Many companies lack staff (47 per cent). Production is also delayed due to lack of deliveries (45 percent). Due to the uncertainties, business or investment decisions were difficult to make (44 percent).\nIf the trade war between the US and China was already a "wake-up call" to reduce dependencies, the viral crisis from the perspective of EU Chamber President Wuttke underlines the need to "diversify supply chainsYeah. This could happen in other countries in Asia, but also within China. In view of the enormous size of the second largest economy, Wuttke stressed: "Leaving China is not an option." For example, a million-dollar city like Shenzhen in South China has a similar economic performance to Israel. "There is no second China. It\'s that simple."(dpa'

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — From Monday (March 16), the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will require all employers and employment agencies planning for their foreign domestic workers to enter Singapore to obtain the Ministry\'s approval before they commence their journey. \n The need for MOM\'s entry approval extends to all work pass holders and their dependants with travel history to Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days, regardless of the nationality of the work pass holder. \n The new measures will take effect from 11.59pm on Monday. \n FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKERS \n In addition to requiring entry approval from MOM, maids will also have to serve a mandatory 14-day stay-home notice upon their arrival. This will apply to all new and returning maids travelling to Singapore from any country. \n “The new measures take into consideration that foreign domestic workers live with families and many look after young children and the elderly,” MOM said in a statement on Sunday. \n New workers must serve their stay-home notice at alternative accommodations such as dormitories, hostels or hotels before they can be deployed, while returning workers can serve it at their employer\'s residential address or other accommodation. \n Employers and employment agencies can apply for the entry approval online, said MOM. Applicants will have to provide proper housing and upkeep arrangements for their maids and ensure that they comply with the stay-home notice. They must also ensure that the maid has access to a local mobile phone and remains contactable by the ministry during the 14-day period. \n The ministry added that it will provide an assistance package to support Singaporean or Permanent Resident employers affected by the new requirements. They can receive S$60 daily per affected worker and have their levy waived during the 14-day period.\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n Employers can apply for the package within 90 days of the foreign domestic worker completing the stay-home notice. To be eligible, the maid must not serve the stay-home notice at the employer\'s residential address. Additionally, if they have a valid work pass, they must have left Singapore on or before March 15. Otherwise, their work pass application must be submitted to MOM on or before March 15. \n MOM added that foreign domestic workers should not make travel plans to Singapore before the ministry’s approval has been obtained. After approval has been given, the approval letter must be sent to the worker, who will need to show it to airline staff during check-in and to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officials upon arriving at the checkpoint in Singapore. \n MOM warned that enforcement action — including the revocation of work passes and suspension of work pass privileges — will be taken if employers or employment agencies do not comply with the new requirements. Employment agencies who violate the requirements will also be given demerit points. \n "Employment agencies, employers and their foreign domestic workers have a collective duty to ensure that the entry approval and the stay-home notice requirements are complied with," the Ministry said. \n Additionally, MOM "strongly encouraged" maids to spend their rest days at home, in light of the social distancing measures that have been introduced in Singapore. \n Workers who have errands to run on their rest day should do so on a weekday when public spaces are less crowded. Employers should also encourage their maids to avoid gathering in public places, MOM added. \n Employers should also not assign work to their maids if they agree to spend their rest day at home. Alternatively, if a maid decides to forgo her rest day, her employer must provide compensation. \n WORK PASS HOLDERS \n The new entry approval requirement will apply to existing work pass holders currently out of Singapore and in-principle approval holders who have yet to enter the country, MOM said in a separate statement on Sunday. \n The affected work pass holders must serve a mandatory 14-day stay-home notice upon arriving in Singapore and employers must declare to MOM that they have arranged for suitable premises to house their affected employees for the duration of the notice period. \n Employers can apply for entry approval online and should inform their affected employees not to make travel plans until MOM approval has been received. \n Similar to the case of foreign domestic workers, employers of the affected work pass holders must send the MOM approval letter to their employees, who will need to show it to airline staff upon check-in and at the ICA checkpoint in Singapore. \n Those who do not comply with MOM\'s requirements could have their work pass revoked or work pass privileges withdrawn, the Ministry said. \n Additionally, MOM has extended its leave of absence support programme to those serving stay-home notices due to Covid-19 since Feb 18, 11.59pm. \n Under the programme, eligible employers can apply for S$100 daily per affected worker and a levy waiver for the duration of the stay-home notice. Affected workers include Singapore citizens, permanent residents and work pass holders who were placed on a stay-home notice upon their return to Singapore. \n Businesses and self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents will be eligible for the programme if work was not performed remotely by affected workers, and if they were placed on a leave of absence or stay-home notice upon their return to Singapore after: \n Travelling to mainland China on or before Jan 31, or \n Travelling to Daegu city or Cheongdo county in South Korea on or before Feb 26, or \n Travelling to South Korea, Northern Italy, or Iran before March 4, or \n Travelling to Italy, Spain, France or Germany on or before March 15, or \n Traveling to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom on or before March 16 \n "As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there may be additional requirements imposed on work pass holders from time to time," said MOM. Employers and employees are advised to check the MOM’s website at http://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19 for the latest information. \n '

'888888,0,SINGAPORE — Customers who placed orders for parcels from China after the middle of January can expect delays due to the Covid-19 outbreak and extended Chinese New Year break in China, e-commerce companies told TODAY on Friday (Feb 14). \n TODAY spoke to 10 customers of e-commerce companies Ezbuy, Qoo10, Lazada and Shopee, who said that their orders had been delayed or cancelled as retailers in China had not dispatched their items, and had not given them reasons for the holdup. \n A Lazada spokesperson said that delays are expected for orders placed after Jan 20 due to the extended Chinese New Year holiday in China implemented because of the Covid-19 outbreak, and the wider implications of the outbreak. \n “We are expecting orders placed after Jan 20 to have processing and shipping delays,” the spokesperson told TODAY. \n “We have communicated this to affected customers and offered to facilitate cancellation for those who wished to,” the spokesperson said, but declined to comment on whether cancellation policies will be different during this period. \n Lazada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its partners to help sellers. \n “As the shopping experience for our consumers continues to be our top priority, we are exercising all efforts to better match the demand with supply by leveraging our technology and logistics capabilities within Lazada and the Alibaba economy,” the spokesperson added. \n Lazada is controlled by China\'s e-commerce giant Alibaba. \n An Ezbuy spokesperson said there had been some parcel delays caused by a pause in operations by manufacturers, suppliers, couriers and logistics firms. \n "However, with more suppliers resuming their operations this week, including domestic couriers and international logistic companies, we have observed that things are gradually progressing and we remain hopeful about the situation," the spokesperson added. \n A Shopee spokesperson said that customers can expect delays due to the extended Chinese New Year period as sellers in China are trying to resume operations. \n “We are working closely with our sellers and delivery partners to ensure orders are fulfilled as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson said. \n “In the meantime, we will continue to closely monitor the Covid-19 situation, and we remain committed to protecting the well-being of our users during this time,” the spokesperson said. \n POSSIBLE REASONS FOR DELAYED ORDERS \n Assistant Professor Yuen Kum Fai at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) School of Civil and Environmental Engineering said that the delays of orders could be due to the cancellation of freight services, resulting in a shortage of the items. \n “I believe the delays are caused by both international and domestic shipping. However, restricted international flights might be a bigger contributor to delays,” he said. \n He added that increased health measures for drivers could have slowed down local transportation of goods in China. \n “The increase in administration, health screening and checks on drivers could further slow down the process,” he said. \n Professor Lawrence Loh at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School said that the delays could be due to a shortage of workers at manufacturing companies, warehouses and transport companies due to the outbreak. \n “Workers could not be going back to their companies due to health reasons as they may be quarantined,” he said. “Or they could be fearful to return.” \n He added that e-commerce sites can turn to exporters from other countries such as South Korea or India instead of China during this period. \n Mr Lucas Tok, a lecturer at the Singapore Polytechnic School of Business, said that e-commerce companies here could find it difficult to inform customers about the reasons for delayed orders as the companies might not know why either. \n “The situation in China is changing very quickly and there needs to be fast decisions made on the ground there regarding the businesses,” he said. “There might be a mismatch of information and not regular updates between China and companies here.” \n DELAYED OR CANCELLED ORDERS \n Customers of e-commerce sites said that their orders were cancelled as retailers in China did not dispatch their items and did not give reasons for it. \n Ms Kelly Poon, 39, who works in customer service, said that her Ezbuy parcel that she placed on Jan 19 has still not arrived as the retailer in China has not dispatched it. \n “I asked Ezbuy about it and there wasn\'t really a good reply,” she said. “I was just asked to wait, with no estimated timeline or prompt updates.” \n Undergraduate Joel Ng, 26, said that of the 10 orders of household items that he has placed on Aliexpress since Jan 25, only two were shipped out to Singapore, which occurred on Feb 9. \n “From past experience, they ship out within two to three days,” he said, adding that he cancelled some of them because he was tired of waiting and bought them locally instead. \n He has two orders that have yet to be shipped out by the seller in China. \n “I’m quite annoyed but never mind, a lot of them are impulse buys so they are not necessities,” he said. \n A Shopee retailer, happishop, wrote in an automated reply that it\xa0apologises for possible delays in deliveries. \n “We apologise that due to the global coronavirus outbreak and disruptions to our supply chain, we are still experiencing difficulties in fulfilling your order,” it wrote. \n '

'888888,0,The epidemic of Covid-19, caused by a new coronavirus, triggered the online sales of the novels "The Plague" by Albert Camus, and Joseph Saramago\'s "Blindness Test" in Italy, the most affected European country.\nIn times of fear of the new coronavirus detected in December in China, various cultural events and equipment have already been cancelled in order to avoid propagation, but on the other hand, the search for books, films, series or games that address the topic of pandemics has been increasing since the beginning of the year.\nThe latest indicators show an increase in book sales such as "The Plague" (1947), written by Franco-Algerian writer Albert Camus, Nobel Prize winner for Literature, whose 60th anniversary of death is noted this year, who is talking about a plague epidemic in the 1940s, which quickly takes over the whole city of Oron in Algeria.\nSubject to quarantine, this city becomes an unbridled territory and its inhabitants are led into states of suffering, madness, but also compassion.\nLast month in Italy-- the most affected European country, with three.089 cases of confirmed infection, over fifty thousand people were quarantined due to the Covid-19 outbreak.\nIn this country, Camus\'book rose to the third place in portal ibs\' top sales, when a month ago it was in 71st place, it reported the Italian newspaper "La Repubblica", in advance that the Amazon platform also recorded an increase in the book ranking in the category of classics, tripling sales.\nIn France, something similar happened, with 8.889 copies of "The Plague" being sold in the first two months of the year, when all last year the total sales were in the 22.400, according to the Edistat book sales statistics portalYeah.\nAlso Joseph Saramago\'s "Blindness Test" (1995), a writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature three years later, became a literary phenomenon in Italy, having reached the top-10 of ibs and Amazon\'s 5th place, with an increase in 180% in sales.\nThe story tells of an epidemic of white blindness, which begins with a man inexplicably blinded when he is inside the car in the middle of traffic, and which spreads like a powder fuse, until collective blindness.\nA situation similar to the search for these books is happening with films like Steven Soderbergh\'s "Contagion" (2011), in which a woman returning from a business trip to Hong Kong dies of a supposed flu, but the virus spreads and the deadly epidemic spreads, with doctors running out of time to try to identify the virus and fight it and stop the panic of the population.\n"Contagion" is already among the ten most watched films on iTunes and among the fifteen most downloaded, according to Google Trends.\nThe Netflix documentary "Pandemia", which features heroes in a battle against flu and their work to prevent an outbreak around the world, which is not caused by the coronavirus, but shows that the world health system is not prepared to face a global health crisis, has also become a central issue on Twitter.\nAnd as fear sells, various predictions are already on social media, one of which is reported in the novel "The Eyes of Darkness", by American science fiction writer Dean Koontz.\nPublished in 1981, with a reimpression in 1989, the book has a chapter on a disease called Wuhan-400, which is actually a biological weapon created in that Chinese city.\nThe page describing the consequences of the virus itself became viral, especially on Twitter: "They call it Wuhan-400 because it was created in one of the RDNA research laboratories outside the city of Wuhan, and it was strain n.400 of man-made micro-organisms created in this center. Wuhan is the perfect weapon. It only affects human beings. No other living thing can be a carrier."\nViral also became an image of the "Asterix in Italy" comic, published in 2017, where a driver named Coronavirus takes part in a chariot race, although it has nothing to do with any disease, being only a curiosity of name and country.\nIn these days of searching for catastrophic omens, also a warning from Bill Gates, made in February of 2017, was put into circulation.

'888888,0,NEW YORK — Religious pilgrims, migrant workers, businessmen, soldiers and clerics all flow constantly across Iran’s frontiers, often crossing into countries with few border controls, weak and ineffective governments and fragile health systems. \n Now, as it struggles to contain the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus, Iran is also emerging as the second focal point after China for the spread of the disease. Cases in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates — even one in Canada — have all been traced to Iran, sending tremors of fear rippling out from Kabul to Beirut. \n The Middle East is in many ways the perfect place to spawn a pandemic, experts say, with the constant circulation of both Muslim pilgrims and itinerant workers who might carry the virus. Iran’s economy has been strangled by sanctions, its people have lost trust in their government and its leaders are isolated from much of the world, providing little clarity about the extent of the epidemic. \n Civil wars or years of unrest have shattered the health systems of several neighboring countries, like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. And most of the region is governed largely by authoritarians with poor track records at providing public transparency, accountability and health services. \n “It is a recipe for a massive viral outbreak,” said Mr Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the former founding executive director of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. \n Millions of Muslim pilgrims travel each year from around the region to visit Shiite holy sites in Iran and Iraq. In January alone, 30,000 people returned to Afghanistan from Iran, and hundreds of others continue to make the pilgrimage to Qom, the site of the outbreak, every week, Afghan officials say. \n Iraq closed its border with Iran on Saturday (Feb 22), but millions cross it every year. So scores of infected people could potentially have brought the virus to Iraq, depending on how long it has been present in Iran. And as of midday Monday in Najaf, flights to and from Iran were still taking off and landing. \n Governors of Iraqi provinces bordering Iran were taking the potential for contagion seriously and at least two were personally inspecting the border crossings to ensure that they were being policed and that Iranians were barred from crossing into Iraq. \n Mr Qutaybah al-Jubouri, the head of the Iraqi Parliament’s Health Affairs Committee, called the coronavirus “a plague” and said his committee was demanding a far more complete closure of all “land, sea and air” borders with Iran “until the disease is completely controlled.” \n Iran’s health ministry sent a letter to the governor of Qom on Thursday and asked Shiite religious leaders to limit the number of pilgrims at the Shrine to Fatima Masumeh and other religious sites in the city, but as of early Tuesday, throngs of people still gathered around the shrine, touching it and taking part in communal prayers. \n Iran is in many ways a case study in the risks of the disease spreading. The country reported its first case of the coronavirus less than a week ago, in Qom. On Monday health officials reported that four people had died there in the last day, bringing the total to 12. At least 61 others had been infected in Iran, the officials said, with new cases being reported in Isfahan, Hamedan and other cities, as well as in Qom. \n Now the slow drip of news about the spread of the virus is compounding Tehran’s already acute credibility problems, less than two months after officials were forced to admit lying about their knowledge of the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet by air defense systems. Many Iranians on Monday were openly skeptical about the official accounts of the spread of the virus. \n A member of Parliament representing Qom claimed on Monday that at least 50 people had already died there, including 34 in quarantine, and that the first case had been reported more than two weeks before officials acknowledged any infections. \n “Every day 10 people are dying in Qom,” the lawmaker, Mr Ahmad Amiri Farahani, asserted in a speech to Parliament, demanding a quarantine on his city. \n Health Ministry officials vehemently disputed his claims. “I will resign if the numbers are even half or a quarter of this,” said Mr Ahmad Harirchi, adviser to the health minister. \n Adding to the public anxiety, the Iranian news media reported that Dr Mohamad Reza Ghadir, the head of a medical university in Qom and the top official in charge of managing the outbreak there, was among those placed in quarantine. \n On Monday, Dr Ghadir said on Iran’s state television network that the Health Ministry had ordered city officials “not to publish any statistics” related to the outbreak in Qom. The situation there was “very dire and disease has spread across the city, ” he said. \n Iranians, distrusting the authorities, were ignoring official urgings to stay away from hospitals for fear of spreading the disease, instead crowding into emergency rooms to be tested. Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran put up a triage tent outside to handle the overflow. \n In an interview with BBC Persian from Tehran, Dr Babak Gharaye Moghadam urged citizens to “please, please listen” to the advice of health officials and not to turn to social media feeds on their cellphones for guidance. \n The price of hospital masks was spiking across the region, including in Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Afghanistan, where some were selling for as much as 30 times the usual cost. \n Experts worry that few Middle Eastern countries are ready to respond effectively to the threat posed by the virus. \n “How ready are these countries?” asked Dr Montaser Bilbisi, an American-trained infectious disease specialist practicing in Amman, Jordan. “In all honesty, I have not seen the level of readiness that I have seen in China or elsewhere, and even some of the personal protective equipment is lacking.” \n In Jordan, for example, he said that he had not yet seen a fully protective hazardous materials suit. “So health care workers would be at very high risk for infection.” \n In Afghanistan, officials said the first confirmed case of the virus was a 35-year old man from the western province of Herat who had recently traveled to Qom. \n Health officials declared a state of emergency in Herat. The government on Sunday had already suspended all air and ground travel to and from Iran. \n But the border is difficult to seal. Thousands cross every week for religious pilgrimages, trade, jobs and study — about 30,000 in January alone, the International Organization of Migration, an intergovernmental agency, reported. \n “In the past two weeks, more than 1,000 people have visited or traveled to Qom from Herat, which means they come into closer contact with the virus,” the Afghan health minister, Mr Ferozuddin Feroz, said Monday at a news conference in Kabul. \n As officials offered reassurances that they were ordering more hospital masks, residents were panicking about what other precautions to take. \n The son of a professor at a university in Herat, who returned three days ago from Iran, called a reporter for The New York Times on Monday asking what the procedure for quarantine was. \n “My father doesn’t show any signs of corona, but he and our family are worried,” the son, Mr Mohamad Iman, said. “He’s locked himself up in a room where he just reads books. He has asked us to leave him some food and water at the door, but to stay away.” \n Saudi Arabia was the epicenter of a similar outbreak seven years ago, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, that was transmitted from camels to humans. \n But even after seven years, Saudi Arabia, one of the richest countries in the world, has struggled to adapt state-of-the-art hygiene procedures to limit the spread of the virus within hospitals. A Mers outbreak last spring infected at least 61 people, killing eight of them. \n “Many hospitals in Saudi Arabia have improved but some could still do better at prevention,” said Dr David L. Heymann, former chairman of Britain’s Health Protection Agency. \n In Iraq, the country with the most extensive border with Iran, only one case has been detected so far: that of a 22-year old Iranian religious student in Najaf, Mr Suhail Mohammad Ali. \n In the first comprehensive steps to combat the spread of the virus, the education department in Najaf on Monday postponed spring exams and the sacred Imam Ali Shrine was closed. \n The central government’s Health Department recommended avoiding crowded places, kissing or shaking hands. \n In Lebanon, a 41-year-old woman who had traveled to Qom on a religious pilgrimage landed in Beirut on Thursday night and was found Friday to have the virus. It was not until Monday, though, that the government issued an emergency plan, suggesting that travel to the affected areas be restricted and that arriving passengers be isolated at the airport if they showed symptoms. \n But no definite restrictions were ordered; not all passengers landing in Beirut in recent days have been screened; and another two planes from Qom were allowed to land in Beirut on Monday. Passengers on the plane carrying the infected Lebanese woman from Qom were told to quarantine themselves at home. \n The country’s health minister, Dr Hamad Hasan, on Monday urged the Lebanese to stay calm. But Mr Rabih Shaer, founder of a Lebanese nonprofit that campaigns against corruption, called the government’s sluggish response “irresponsible and criminal.” \n “Already the Lebanese population lost trust that this political class can face all the problems,” he said. “And now, until today, they still haven’t taken the right measures. There’s no transparency, there’s no accountability.” \n Dr Nada Melhem, a virologist at the American University of Beirut who has been consulting with the Health Ministry, acknowledged that, “the level of panic in Lebanon is really high.” \n “But with systematic follow-up, we will be able to contain it,” she added. “Are we going to have some gaps? We will definitely have some, but I hope we can limit them as much as we can.” THE NEW YORK TIMES \n '

"888888,0,Wuhan huoshenshan hospital received the first batch of 50 people infected with new coronavirus pneumonia on February 4. The patients were transferred from the overloaded hospital in Wuhan. According to reports, huoshenshan hospital does not have an outpatient service, and patients cannot go to this hospital to see a doctor or be hospitalized.\nAFP said that since January 24, China has been keen to watch the construction of the temporary hospital. Many camera lenses take pictures of thousands of continuous workers and excavators and cranes operating on the site almost 24 hours a day.\nToday, China's state-run television showed that the first 50 patients were transported to huoshenshan hospital by emergency vehicles. Some of them were in wheelchairs, others were lying on flatbed scooters, and others were walking with the help of people wearing blue protective clothing.\nHuoshenshan hospital, with a total area of 34000 square meters and 1000 beds, is under the control of the military. The president of the hospital is Zhang sibing, Minister of health service of 301 General Hospital of the Chinese people's Liberation Army.

'888888,0,(Reuters) - Struck down by coronavirus at the age of 83, the long life of Alfredo Visioli ended with a short ceremony at a graveyard near Cremona, his hometown in northern Italy.\n“They buried him like that, without a funeral, without his loved ones, with just a blessing from the priest,” said his granddaughter Marta Manfredi who couldn’t attend. Like most of the old man’s family - like most of Italy - she was confined to her home.\n“When all this is over,” she vows, “we will give him a real funeral.”\nEverywhere the coronavirus has struck, regardless of culture or religion, ancient rituals to honor the dead and comfort the bereaved have been cut short or abandoned for fear of spreading it further.\nThe virus, which has killed nearly 9,000 people worldwide, is reshaping many aspects of death, from the practicalities of handling infected bodies to meeting the spiritual and emotional needs of those left behind.\nIn Ireland, the health authority is advising mortuary workers to put face masks on dead bodies to reduce even the minor risk of infection. In Italy, a funeral company is using video links to allow quarantined families to watch a priest bless the deceased. And in South Korea, fear of the virus has caused such a drop in the number of mourners that funeral caterers are struggling for business.\nThere is little time for ceremony in hard-hit cities such as Bergamo, northeast of Milan, where the mortuaries are full and the crematorium is working around the clock, said Giacomo Angeloni, a local official in charge of cemeteries.\nBergamo, home to about 120,000 people, has been dealing with 5-6 times the number of dead it would in normal times, he said.\nItaly has now reported nearly 3,000 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus - the highest outside China where the virus first emerged. The Italian army sent 50 troops and 15 trucks to Bergamo on Wednesday to take bodies to less overwhelmed provinces.\nA ban on gatherings has shattered the vital rituals that help us grieve, said Andy Langford, the chief operating officer of Cruse Bereavement Care, a British charity providing free care and counseling to those in grief.\n“Funerals allow a community to come together, express emotion, talk about that person and formally say goodbye,” he said.\n“When you feel you have no control over how you can grieve, and over how you can experience those last moments with someone, that can complicate how you grieve and make you feel worse,” he said.\nIn Iran as in northern Italy, hospital and funeral workers are overwhelmed with bodies, as the virus has torn across the country, killing 1,284 people and infecting thousands, according to state TV.\nThe authorities have hired new people to dig graves, said a manager at Tehran’s Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. “We work day and night,” he said. “I have never seen such a sad situation. There are no funerals.”\nMost corpses arrive by truck and are buried without the ritual washing that Islam dictates, he said.\nSome Iranians suspect that the official haste to bury them has more to do with obscuring the spiraling death toll than halting the spread of the virus.\nDeaths from COVID-19 have been recorded as heart attacks or lung infections, a hospital worker in Kashan, a city about a three-hour drive from Tehran, told Reuters.\n“The officials are lying about the death toll,” the worker said. “I have seen dozens of corpses in the past few days, but they have told us not to talk about it.” Two nurses at Iranian hospitals also told Reuters they thought the death toll was higher than the official tally.\nIranian authorities have rejected allegations of a cover-up, and President Hassan Rouhani, in a televised speech on Mar. 18, said his government had been “honest and straightforward with the nation.”\nIn several countries, clusters of infection have followed funerals. In South Korea, where more than 90 people have died, the government has urged the families of COVID-19 victims to cremate their loved ones first, and hold the funeral later.\nKorean funerals usually take place in hospitals, and involve three days of prayers and feasting. Most of the country’s early cases were linked to a church in Daegu city and a hospital in a nearby county. In February, several members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus attended a funeral at the hospital for the brother of the church’s founder.\nSince the outbreak, the number of mourners at funerals has plunged by 90%, regardless of whether the deceased had the virus, said Choi Min-ho, secretary general of the Korea Funeral Association.\n“The culture of funerals has changed significantly,” he said. “A handful of mourners quickly offer condolences and leave the place without dining together out of infection worries.”\nCondolence money, traditionally handed over in cash, is now sent via bank transfer, he added.\nAuthorities in Wuhan, the epicenter of China’s outbreak and location of the majority of its deaths, quickly identified the funeral business as a potential source of transmission.\nThe local civil affairs bureau in late January ordered all funerals for confirmed COVID-19 victims to be handled at a single funeral home in the city’s Hankou district. Mourning ceremonies, usually boisterous social events in China, were curtailed along with all other public gatherings.\nThose restrictions are still in place, even though the number of new cases has dwindled in recent weeks. Bereaved families are not even allowed to see the bodies of their loved ones, a worker at the funeral home told Reuters.\nIn China, the ashes of the deceased tend to be kept in funeral homes until they are taken to a family plot on public holidays such as the Tomb Sweeping Festival in April. That’s also canceled this year.\nIn Spain, too, a large cluster of cases has been traced to a funeral in the northern town of Vitoria in late February. At least 60 people who attended tested positive after the event, said local media reports.\nWith over 600 deaths, Spain is the second-worst hit country in Europe after Italy, and most people are now confined to their homes. Referring to these restrictions, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called coronavirus a “cruel” disease that paralyses the human need to socialize.\nIn Ireland, up to 100 guests are still allowed at all funerals - for now. But most families are opting for small private ceremonies and encouraging others to express their condolences online through websites such as RIP.ie, where death notices and funeral invitations are usually posted.\nOpen casket funerals are out for any victim of coronavirus, and “the family should be advised not to kiss the deceased,” according to new guidelines from Ireland’s Health and Safety Executive to its funeral directors.\nThe risk of catching coronavirus from a dead body is slim, public health officials say, but some countries are recommending extra measures.\nIsrael has reported no coronavirus deaths, but its health ministry says the deceased should be double-wrapped in impermeable plastic. Ritual washing and rites will be performed in full protective gear and the corpse re-wrapped in plastic for burial. Normally Israel’s Jewish dead are laid to rest in a cloth smock and shroud.\nIreland’s guidelines advise workers in funeral parlors to put face masks on dead bodies before moving them, in case they “expel a very small amount of air and viral droplets from the lungs” and infect the living.\nIn Britain, where the pandemic is still gathering pace, there is widespread anxiety about the likely death toll.\nBritain has been slower in implementing the strict measures seen elsewhere in Europe, and expert estimates of how many will die from COVID-19 have ranged wildly from the tens to the hundreds of thousands.\nAn emergency bill to tackle the virus, which has killed 104 people in Britain, includes a number of measures the government says will “streamline the death management process.” The measures include allowing funeral directors to register a death on behalf of a self-isolating family.\nDeborah Smith, a spokesperson for the National Association of Funeral Directors, said the bill will help the profession “preserve the dignity of those who die and care for their bereaved families with compassion - even if they are not able to have the kind of funeral they would have wanted.”\nSmith would not be drawn on the expected numbers, but said “funeral directors are preparing for a variety of scenarios.”\nOne scenario is already playing out in Wuhan.\nLast month, a worker at the funeral home in Hankou district, identifying himself only as Huang, wrote an essay that was circulated on social media. He said funeral workers were as overwhelmed as the city’s medics but had received less recognition.\nHe said staff had worked without a break since the start of the epidemic. “Some of our employees don’t even drink water because they need to go to the toilet and it’s difficult to take off the protective clothing,” he wrote.\nHalf a world away, in the virus-stricken Italian town of Bergamo, funeral workers wage a near-identical struggle.\n“It’s like being in a war with an invisible enemy,” said Roberta Caprini, a partner in Centro Funerario Bergamasco, a funeral service in Bergamo. “We’ve been working without interruption for two weeks and sleeping 3-4 hours a night when we manage it. Everyone in our area, us included, has lost someone or have someone sick in their home.”\nBergamo’s Church of All Saints has become a makeshift mortuary, its pews pushed aside to accommodate the dead. Caprini said she had counted at least 60 coffins when she visited on Tuesday.\nShe spoke of the “real torture” felt by families who watched sick relatives taken away to hospital and never saw them again. Her company has arranged video links to burials, to allow families to watch the priest bless the deceased.\nSometimes, she said, they drive the hearses past the bereaved family’s home, so mourners “can at least come down at the moment and offer a quick prayer.”\n(This story has been refiled to fix the bylines)\n'
'888888,0,SINGAPORE - There are more than 1,900 Singaporeans in mainland China who are registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) but the actual number there is likely to be much higher, said Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Monday (March 2). \n He also said in Parliament that the ministry is aware of one Singaporean who was infected with the coronavirus and hospitalised in China\'s Hubei province. \n The Singapore embassy in Beijing contacted the man to offer help and he has since been discharged from hospital, he added in his reply to Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang GRC). \n The minister urged Singaporeans who are overseas to register with the MFA online amid the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak in China and other countries. \n This will enable the ministry to contact Singaporeans abroad and provide help in an emergency, he said. \n "We\'ve now made it even easier than ever before to e-register using SingPass Mobile," said Dr Balakrishnan, who is also the minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative. \n "Our embassy in Beijing and our consulate-general in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Xiamen maintain close contact with the Singapore community in mainland China. \n "Any Singaporean there who is in need of consular assistance can approach my colleagues in those missions at any time." \n He also said many of the 266 Singaporeans and their family members who were evacuated from Hubei on two Scoot flights on Jan 30 and Feb 9 had registered with the ministry, \n This made it much easier to contact them and arrange their return to Singapore, he added. \n The 266 passengers were quarantined on landing in Singapore. Seven later tested positive for the coronavirus and all have since recovered and been discharged from hospital. \n Dr Balakrishnan said: "I would like to commend the consular officers from MFA who have been working extra hard in this critical period to look out for overseas Singaporeans. We will not leave any Singaporean behind." \n Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten) asked why Singaporeans in China have not returned. \n Dr Balakrishnan said some are living and working in China and their livelihoods depend on their presence there. \n Others have family members there and feel an obligation to look after them, he said. \n "Every family will have its own unique reasons. The key point is this: we will remain in touch and do our best to help." \n CLICK TO LISTEN TO ST\'S HEALTH CHECK PODCAST \n '
'888888,0,Moscow, March 19. /tass/ The Internet initiative development fund sent a letter to Mikhail mishuskin, Prime Minister of the government of the Russian Federation, requesting the adoption of a bill to expand the power of doctors, This will allow them to diagnose patients remotely and provide treatment. This is in a letter on behalf of the Kirill Varlamov foundation, which tasis owns.\nAt present, with the global epidemic situation and the rapid spread of covid-19 virus in Russia, it is particularly urgent to develop telemedicine in Russia. " -Take note of the text in the letter. It also said, The Russian news agency stated that the law on amending certain legislation of the Russian Federation on the application of information technology in the field of health, which came into force on January 1, 2018, laid a foundation for the application of information technology in the field of health 2. Using telemedicine to provide medical assistance remotely. However, Varlamov pointed out that the method does not specify the possibility of diagnosis or the possibility of treatment for the diagnosis results. This greatly reduces the application of telemedicine technologyAbout\n"In this regard, it is clear that there is a need for the speedy adoption of a bill to expand the power of doctors in remote assistance, That is, the possibility of remote diagnosis and treatment. " This will reduce the number of people entering treatment facilities and help to care for more patients.\nAs the director of the Department of legal initiatives, Freya Alexandra olehovic, pointed out, at present, Russian law does not allow doctors to diagnose and treat remotely, That is to say, doctors can only do so legally after an individual has been treated. " In the case of limited mobility, access to qualified medical assistance should not be denied. This is also particularly important for older people who are particularly at risk. This interim measure should be able to quickly detect potentially dangerous conditions in the early stages of the disease, including coronavirus, And prevent people from congregating in medical institutions "- quote his words from the foundation press office.\nThe French agency for international development cooperation stands ready to provide expert and organizational support for the drafting of the bill.\nDoctor\'s opinion\nThis is an important decision in the current epidemic situation, especially in this case, When patients only need to ask question。 There is a group of people who run on every little thing and ask for expert advice, but in principle they don\'t need to. Therefore, in some cases, especially in the case of therapeutic diseases, adequate online tutoring, including video tutoring, can be provided -Share with TASS, associate doctor of medicine, associate professor, surgeon oncologist Sergei osminin\nAccording to him, this not only helps to reduce virus infection, including the spread of coronavirus, but also helps to filter patients in the outpatient department, They really need expert personal advice. " I think it\'s even necessary in this case, because we can assess the patient\'s condition by phone. Through telemedicine, we can see the vision of a patient, and he can tell us what is bothering him. According to the protocol, we can specify symptom treatment "- add immunocorrection to the general manager of tacis medical center. Hotanova, doctor - physician Lyudmila rapa.\nHowever, doctors point out that the main problem in this area is to take this consultation seriously. " Not every doctor can take on such a responsibility, which actually seems easy. It needs knowledge and experience. The main task is not to hurt, "she explained.\n"When the doctor is responsible, he should recommend hospitalization in any dangerous situation, or should still go to see the doctor.About In my opinion, about 50% of requests can be reduced in this way, "osmium concluded.\nCoronavirus pandemic\nA new outbreak of coronavirus has occurred in Central China.

'888888,0,A new coronavirus, which has been infected by hundreds of thousands of people in the world, is likely to be able to adapt to its own vector, Because it\'s not good for any parasite to kill its owner. A leading Russian virologist and professor talked about this in an interview with the Russian news agency, as well as the spread prospect of covid-19 in Russia and the possibility of pets infected with the virus. Director of microbial ecology laboratory, DVF biomedical school Yegorov\'s hopes are in conversation.\n-Mikhail Yuryevich has begun the first trial of the C Lo Navin Ross vaccine. How do you evaluate its future?\nSo far everything has gone well. I think there will be vaccines in Russia by summer. I still hope that this proposal does not need to be widely applied. The best option - the vaccine is still a back-up option. Intermediate programs - vaccines are only available to the elderly at risk, people with diabetes, overweight and cardiovascular disease. These are the standard risk categories of orz. In the worst case, the vaccine must include a seasonal influenza vaccine. But I don\'t think it will come, I hope the best.\nToo many coronaviruses are immune, but only experiments can make us establish its stabilityAbout But from the beginning, we can say that it will be several years, that is to say, the most likely, immunity will not exist for a lifetime.\n-Can humans adapt to a new coronavirus?\n-Humans can\'t, viruses can. It is not good for any parasite to kill its owner. If the virus is too virtual, it\'s not good for him. Sooner or later, the virus will spread among the population, leading to increasingly mild diseases. The virus is easier to adapt because it changes faster. Generally speaking, viruses do not exist as a single solution, which is a cloud choice. They chose those selective advantages over others, which is an advantage - less toxic to their owners - people. That is to say, we will not adapt to him, and he is ours, which is normal.\nSo, one day, people can put corona on their feet?\n-Flu, which we also put on our feet when we are young, when we arrive at risk, can be bad. In this case, coronavirus components will need to be included in the seasonal vaccine.\nYou have reported that the virus is sensitive to high temperature. Does Russia have the risk of another positive cycle when it enters the low tide in summer?\nThis is a riskAbout If the virus becomes a seasonal normal component of ozone depleting substances, it will show seasonal influenza like other epidemic mumps with low toxicity.\nIt is important not to allow the virus to enter the action space and adapt to the human population from the beginning. During 2002-2003, not only in China, but also around the world, the situation of close relatives of the new Colorado virus (SARS) was under control. In other words, the spread of infectious diseases has not continued on such a large scale that the virus can adapt to the human population. But what the United States and the European Union show us today is the eighteenth century. This is related to the characteristics of who there, including preventive measures.\n-In this case, is the slow spread of Russian virus related to the security measures taken by China?\n-Russia has the best biosafety system in the world since the Soviet Union. Don\'t confuse it with the system of the Ministry of health - it\'s not about treating patients, it\'s about prevention, organizing prevention, It is the responsibility of the Russian consumer protection agency and other agencies. Everyone works together and shows good inter agency cooperation. That\'s what you\'ve got - all the bad cases, we see, don\'t spread to epidemic outbreaksAbout Only in the worst case can the virus spread within the family. But it often does not exist, because it will soon be found that the correct diagnosis and rapid positioning.\nThat\'s what we don\'t see in the biosafety systems of the United States and the European Union. The fact that it is too early for who to announce the pandemic is due to the panic of political elites in the United States and the European Union, which needs to be concealed and is spreading. But I don\'t think I should.\n-Do you think that Russia\'s current measures to combat Colorado Russia are enough, or should everyone stay at home?\n-Enough, even a good reserve. The only thing to remember is that the social system is complex and random: someone flees quarantine, for example. Sometimes even a slight vibration is enough to break the stability. Therefore, safety measures must be treated responsibly. The authorities have taken sufficient measures, but no one can guarantee whether they are sufficient to meet the current situation of our society.\n-As you have said, this type of coronavirus cannot be excluded artificiallyAbout Can a naturally mutated virus be triggered in China, as reported by some media?\n-This virus is a natural virus, like all natural viruses, it can circulate in the population of its natural reservoir, in this case, it is a bat), without human participation. If one strengthens the interaction between groups, for example, Collect a large number of wild animals for sale in the Eastern market. This is because SARS CoV, with the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus) mers CoV, occurs in Wuhan market and is related to the epidemiology of today\'s sars-cov-2. Most likely, from what we know, it happened there. But I would like to emphasize once again that this is a normal process.\nHumans have yet to overcome any other natural infection, and coronavirus will not be the first to be here. Therefore, for natural viruses, the principle can only be one - regular monitoring, so that scientists can do this by monitoring the virus\'s intensified cycle. A reasonable assumption in science. Unfortunately, the grant system does not support regular monitoring of natural origin viruses, which is deplorable.\nIn addition, it is clear that Russia has insufficient viral capacity. Molecular genetic systems work very fast, and we have very few institutions that can deal with particularly dangerous virusesAbout Not at all in the Far East. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and strengthen a high-level biosafety virus laboratory system.\nHow many such laboratories are there in this country?\n-There are two world-class institutions: the Novosibirsk vector and the Institute of Microbiology of the Ministry of defense This is the work of all the first pathogens in this country. That is to say, in the eastern part of Novosibirsk, we have a big white spot. Although there are experts, we can also set up schools in a reasonable time. But we need a clear political order.\n-Is there any data on the race and genetic selectivity of Colorado virus?\n- No. There is no scientific evidence that ethnicity can aggravate or weaken the role of the virus. In the case of age, yes. As we all know, children under the age of 12 are statistically justified, and we know the molecular mechanism of this - they are rarely ill, they are milder. But that doesn\'t mean they have to be excluded from risk groups. With age, people will encounter other risk groups - overweight, cardiovascular disease and so on. But middle-aged people can\'t be protected just because of their age.\n-Can pets get infected?\nMany mammals may be infected. But we don\'t know how serious they are, how many viruses they have releasedAbout Few bats directly infect people in the same China. Most often, they infect the host in the middle. In terms of SARS in 2002, these are Himalayan civets used in East Asia. As far as the Middle East is concerned, it\'s camels, which infect themselves and later infect people. In the case of the new coronavirus, the host in the middle, we don\'t know yet, but it may be a pangolian exotic animal, Kitchen in the East and medicine in the East.\nIt\'s possible to infect small mammals, dogs and cats, including, but that doesn\'t mean that pain, they can infect people. We don\'t eat them, unlike China\'s Himalayan civet. Maybe, in our condition, they are pets). - about. Red... ") is also the victim, the dead branch of the virus cycle. But all this needs to be studied.\n-What is your prediction of the course and end of the pandemic?\n-The pandemic ended when the United States and the European Union ended, because it was under them. It will be a will decision of who, as well as a political decision to announce it.\nIn Russia, when our compatriots continue to return from abroad, the number of malignant events will increase to a certain extentAbout But I hope there won\'t be a wave of epidemics like the European Union in Russia.\nFor the United States and Western Europe, they can do anything, either in terms of their actions or in comparison with China\'s clear and consistent actions. It is this fire that can easily spread to neighboring countries, and to neighboring countries. As far as the Russian Federation is concerned, it remains the pillar of European stability, in all respects as well'

'888888,0,A shadowy church in South Korea has become the focus of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. At the heart of it is a 60-year-old coronavirus patient who may have come in contact with nearly 1200 people.\nAs South Korea battles to control the viral infection, the role of a religious congregation has come under the scanner.\nOn Sunday, the East Asian nation reported 123 new confirmed coronavirus cases and a fourth death from the virus, taking total infections to 556.\nMore than half the additional cases were found to be linked to a Shincheonji Church of Jesus congregation in the southeastern city of Daegu after a 61-year-old woman known as "Patient 31" who attended services at the church tested positive for the virus last week.\nWhat makes Patient 31 special? The woman had no recent record of overseas travel.\nWhile authorities call her "super spreader", the locals have dubbed her "crazy ajumma (Korean for aunty)". Diagnosed with pneumonia-like symptoms on February 18, the sexagenarian resisted doctors’ recommendations to get tested for coronavirus not once but twice.\nAunty\'s day out\nThe Daegu woman\'s story is nothing short of a Hollywood-style caper but the reality is quite grim. She was first admitted to a local hospital after an accident on February 7. While in hospital, she developed a fever but refused to get tested.\nShe was finally tested on February 17 and a day later was diagnosed with coronavirus.\nBut between first entering the hospital and finally being confirmed positive for COVID-19, Patient 31 stepped out on at least four different occasions. All very public places.\nFrom a buffet restaurant to a Korean-style public bath and then to church twice, Patient 31 is estimated to have come in contact with some 1,160 people.\nSouth Korean authorities are now pressed as they deal with the ramifications of the woman\'s trip around Daegu.\nChurch becomes epicentre\nThe biggest spread came from her attendance of the Sunday services at a branch of the mysterious Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\nSome 1,000 Shincheonji church followers who attended Sunday services with her have been quarantined at their homes while authorities screen them for the virus. Health authorities are also trying to monitor thousands of others.\nThe Shincheonji church blamed the woman for the spread of the disease, saying it has been advising followers since late January to stay home if they had travelled overseas or were experiencing even mild cold-like symptoms.\nHealth officials were screening some 9,300 church followers and said that 1,261 of them have exhibited cough and other symptoms. The authorities are scrambling to find churchgoers because many followers don\'t reveal their affiliation owing to the sect\'s reputation.\nAll 74 sites operated by the Shincheonji Church have been closed and churchgoers have been told to instead watch services online for a sect whose leader claims to be an angel of Christ, but who is dismissed by many outsiders as a cult leader.\nIts teachings revolve largely around the Book of Revelation, a chapter of the New Testament known mostly for its apocalyptic foreshadowing.\nAuthorities are trying to determine how Patient 31 contracted coronavirus given that she had no travel history with China. Now, church members have admitted to conducting evangelical missions with Koreans in northeastern China, some of whom were invited to South Korea.\nOfficials are also investigating a possible link between churchgoers and the spike in infections at the Cheongdo hospital, where many have been infected, mostly patients at a mental illness ward. The hospital has also recorded South Korea\'s fourth death from coronavirus.\nChurch or Doomsday cult?\nShincheonji, which translates as new heaven and new earth, was established in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, who has been accused by other Christian groups as a false prophet or a cult leader.\nThe church describes Lee as the Promised Pastor, an attendant of Jesus sent to testify what he claims are the fulfilled prophecies from the Book of Revelation. The church boasts of a membership of more than 1,50,000.\nShincheonji followers believe Lee Man-hee is immortal and has an eternal life, said Ji-il Tark at Busan Presbyterian University in South Korea.\nTo propagate their belief, they often approach their relatives and acquaintances or sneak to other churches without telling them they are Shincheonji members.\nTark said Shincheonji followers are likely more vulnerable to virus infections as they often sit very closely on the floor during services. At Shincheonji, attending church-related gatherings isn’t an option, but a requirement, he said.\nRituals followed at Shincheonji may have further exacerbated the spread of the virus as church members are expected to kneel 10cm apart and hold hands with each other.\nOne member told New York Times that churchgoers are restricted from wearing glasses or masks in premises.\nAlso a part of training?

'888888,0,China kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged on Friday, defying expectations for a reduction to ease borrowing costs in an economy jolted by widespread disruptions to businesses from the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was left unchanged at 4.05 per cent from the previous monthly fixing while the five-year remained at 4.75 per cent.\nAnalysts said the unchanged rate suggests policymakers may think recent measures are enough to help the economy in the immediate term, after the central bank last week cut the amount of reserves commercial banks are required to hold.\nForty respondents, or 71.4 per cent of all participants, in a Reuters snap survey had expected a reduction in the LPR, with 36 predicting either a five basis point or 10 basis point cut in the one-year tenor and no change to the five-year rate.\nBut while the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has rolled out powerful easing measures since the coronavirus outbreak, many economists said it was still not enough to revive demand in the current environment.\n"The lack of any cut this month means that the LPR is still only 10 basis points lower than it was at the end of last year, following a small cut in February," Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics said in a note.\n"But with the economy unlikely to get back on track until next year, further monetary easing will be needed to help address the continued strain on corporate and households balance sheets."\nThe virus situation has gradually stabilized in mainland China with no new domestic transmissions reported on Thursday for the first time, raising hopes that strict containment efforts to stop the spread of the virus are working.\nBut the situation overseas remains concerning. With over 242,000 infections and nearly 10,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War Two, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu.\nThe LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. The PBOC revamped the mechanism to price LPR in August, loosely pegging it to the medium-term lending facility rate.\nThe PBOC left borrowing cost on its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans unchanged on Monday, despite its U.S. counterpart’s decision to slash interest rates to near zero to counteract the economic shock from the coronavirus outbreak.\n'

'888888,0,(Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd warned of a drop in revenues at its key e-commerce businesses this quarter as the coronavirus sweeping China hits supply chains and deliveries.\nThe warning from executives came during an earnings call for the quarter ending in December 2019, during which the company beat analyst estimates and brought in record transactions for its annual Singles’ Day shopping event.\nCEO Daniel Zhang said the delayed return to work following the Lunar New Year, due to the virus outbreak which has killed more than 1,350 people in China and infected thousands more, had caused problems for merchants and delays in fulfilling orders.\nHe said food delivery orders had dropped year-on-year due to the number of restaurants that had closed as a result of the outbreak. And while the company has seen a surge in demand for goods from its Hema supermarkets, it has been held back by limited delivery capacity.\nFinance chief Maggie Wu said most of Alibaba’s businesses that rely on the sale of physical goods would likely see a decline in revenues this quarter.\n“We like other businesses are not immune to supply and demand,” she said. “Their recovery and long term success will translate to long term growth for Alibaba Group.”\nDespite the downbeat forecast, Zhang said that as of Monday Alibaba had observed more people in large cities going back to work and logistics networks returning to normal operations.\nHe also said DingTalk, the company’s enterprise chat app, had seen “explosive growth” during the crisis as white collar businesses and schools use it for remote working and online lessons.\n“Alibaba’s earnings for the next couple of quarters are certainly likely to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak. However, the company’s business is strong enough to withstand the brief downturn, with its cloud computing business set to lead the charge for a more positive outlook,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.\nAlibaba usually reports its highest revenue in the December quarter due to its mega Singles’ Day shopping bonanza in November. The company said sales during the 24-hour event hit a record $38.4 billion in 2019.\nThe group primarily generates revenue by selling advertising and promotional services to third-party merchants that list products on its e-commerce sites, Taobao and Tmall.\nThe company said it was supporting the fight against the coronavirus outbreak by ensuring supply of daily necessities and introducing relief measures for its merchants.\nAlibaba affiliate Ant Financial’s MYBank unit has said it will offer 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in loans to companies in China in the wake of the outbreak.\nThe outbreak, which originated in the city of Wuhan, has resulted in companies laying off workers, seeking cheaper funding and struggling to restart production after an extended Lunar New year holiday, as supply chains are disrupted.\nAlibaba is often viewed as a window into the health of China’s consumer economy, which Beijing views as key to continued economic growth.\nThe epidemic is expected to pile more pressure on China’s economy, just as the government had hoped a preliminary deal with the United States would ease a protracted trade war that had weighed on its growth.\nSales in Alibaba’s core commerce business jumped 38% to 141.48 billion yuan in its third quarter ended Dec. 31, while revenue at its cloud computing unit surged 62% to 10.72 billion.\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders rose to 52.31 billion yuan from 33.05 billion.\nExcluding items, the company earned 18.19 yuan per American Depository Share (ADS).

"888888,0,Health authorities are closely watching an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a new virus that originated in China. Governments are stepping up surveillance of airline passengers from central China and taking other steps to try to control the outbreak.\nHere's what you should know about the illness:\nWHAT IS THE NEW VIRUS?\nScientists have identified it as a new coronavirus. The name comes from the Latin word for crowns or halos, which coronaviruses resemble under a microscope.\nThe coronavirus family has many types that affect people. Some cause the common cold while others originating in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses such as SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome - or MERS - Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nWHERE DID IT COME FROM?\nThe first cases appeared last month in Wuhan, a city in central China's Hubei province. Many of the first people infected had visited or worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has since been closed for an investigation.\nChinese health officials say they believe the illness first spread from animals to people. They now say it can spread between people.\nHOW WIDESPREAD IS IT?\nChina has identified 440 cases and nine deaths, most of the illnesses and all of the deaths in Hubei province. Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, the US and Taiwan.\nThe outbreak coincides with China's busiest travel season as people visit their families or go abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday. That travel rush is expected to spread the disease more widely.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In serious cases, the virus can cause pneumonia\n.\nHOW IS IT TREATED?\nThere is a test to identify the virus, but no vaccine to prevent an infection. Patients with the virus have been isolated in hospitals or homes to prevent spreading it.\nThe symptoms are treated with pain and fever medication, and people are advised to drink plenty of liquids and rest while they recover.\nHOW IS IT SPREADING?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Scientists believe the new virus can spread from person-to-person in close contact through the respiratory tract.\nCOULD IT BE AS BAD AS SARS?\nSo far, the virus appears less dangerous and infectious than SARS, which also started in China in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people. However, viruses can mutate into more dangerous and contagious forms, and it's too early to say what will happen with this one.\n"

Most human coronaviruses, such as the common cold, typically cause mild-to-moderate illness, but some are capable of causing severe disease.\nThe following are coronaviruses that have caused severe major human outbreaks in the past 20 years:\nSARS-CoV - Cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, first emerged in 2002 in China. The highly infectious virus  quickly spread to 37 countries globally. Before it was contained in 2003, the virus had infected 8,098 people and killed 774. SARS symptoms included fever, chills, and body aches and   usually progressed to pneumonia. No cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2012, the United States declared SARS-CoV a select agent - meaning it is capable of posing a severe threat to public health and safety.\nMERS-CoV - The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has caused severe illness in people in more than 26 countries. The virus is thought to have emerged from camels, but it acquired the ability to be transmitted from human to human. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, often leading to pneumonia. About 35% of people infected with MERS died, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Only two U.S. patients ever tested positive for MERS-CoV - infected healthcare workers in 2014 who had traveled to the United States from Saudi Arabia\n.\n2019-CoV - The novel coronavirus that has already infected more than 300 people in China, has been confirmed to be transmitted by people. Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus has so far spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Some countries including Australia and the United States have begun screening passengers at airports who have traveled from China, particularly Wuhan. WHO officials are meeting this week to consider whether this virus should be deemed a global health emergency. CDC officials said last week it is highly plausible there will be cases in the United States.\n'
'888888,0,In Germany, the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV has been detected in four people. No comparison to the thousands of infected in China. But the onset of the virus comes at a time when many people are cold in this country, and the symptoms of both diseases are similar. So when is a cough just a cough and when is a case for the house doctor or even the hospital? Philipp Leson of the German Society of General Medicine and Family Medicine (Degam) explains who is the right contact person in case of a suspicion and what happens if a patient or a patient actually finds the new virus.\nONLINE TIME: Cough, fever,\nThe first symptoms of the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV are respiratory problems.\nCold season not unusual. To whom do I turn now, if\nthey appear to me these days, to my GP or directly to a\nSpecialist?\nPhilipp Leson: Also\nAt the present time, when there are so far very few cases in Germany,\nthe first point of contact with these symptoms naturally as well as your\nHousekeeping. That hasn\'t changed a bit. This is not the case, however.\nif you really have a reasonable suspicion. For example, because you just\nfrom the region around Wuhan in China have come to Germany and now this\nIf you notice any symptoms or have had contact with someone who\nhas been shown to be infected with this disease.\nTIME ONLINE: If I now\ncall the house doctor and say, this is what my complaints look like--\nautomatically asked if I had contact to China?\nLeson: This depends on the type\nand the way you put it. If you just take these symptoms\ncall in practice and ask for an appointment, the medical\nProfessionals on the phone probably don\'t ask for it\nYeah. Often missing yes\nalso the time to get into a real history conversation there. But\nif you call with the concrete hint "I was in China and have now\nthe following symptoms", then it may be good that this is discussed in more detail.\nONLINE TIME: Are there any guidelines\nfor general practitioners, how should they behave in such cases?\nLeson: No, a concrete\nThere is no guideline. There are of course those of the German\nSociety for General Medicine and Family Medicine\nGuidelines on different counselling and treatment facilities\nExample of coughing. There are also specific procedures. However, Degam is currently recommending that each patient with a fever should be informed of the countries in which he and his contact persons last stayed.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003 about 8.000 people died, more than 750.\nYeah. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization\nYeah. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nONLINE TIME: Supposed\nsomeone suspects an infection with the Coronavirus, but does not call before\nto the general practitioner, but comes directly into practice. Is that a risk?\nfor other patients already in the waiting room?\nLeson: A risk to\nThere are always sick people in the waiting room of a doctor\'s office. Because there\nPatients who may be infectious can sit where they can get infected.\ncan. This applies to this virus just as it does to everyone else. Here, too, it is a question of asking how much I, as a patient, appreciate the danger,\nA doctor or an assistant can\'t know that. So, when I\nI know I was in China and I\'ll come back with these symptoms, then I should\nat the reception. But, yes, you can basically\nInfect a disease that a patient has, possibly in practice.\nONLINE TIME: In\nPaediatric practice is sometimes seen as a separate waiting room for children\nExample of wind spots or masts. Is that also available in home doctor\'s practice?\nLeson: It is true, in paediatric practice there are sometimes separate\nWaiting room for babies and older, more infectious children, also in\nHospitals have the\nYeah.

What the\nthen has consequences, depends on the health authority: for example, as in the case in Bavaria, the\ntries to identify possible contact persons who have become infected\ncould.\nONLINE TIME: Some people\ncontinue to work with typical cold symptoms.

This applies not only now, but at all times. Here too, the principles of reasonable suspicion and self-sufficiency are basically once again valid. In addition, anyone can minimise the risks of infection, for example by thoroughly washing their hands.\nONLINE TIME: And should one go to the doctor at the moment in view of the new Coronavirus\nhas such symptoms?\nLeson: You just have to understand the risk constellations:\nIs there really a reasonable suspicion that I have this virus in me\nShoot? But now to say in general: whereas the Coronavirus\nis, should I go to the doctor sooner or rather not come to work,\nThat\'s not necessary.\n'

'888888,0,On March 10, India reported six new cases of COVID-19 from Maharashtra and Karnataka--two states that had so far remained untouched by the coronavirus outbreak in India. With this, the overall number of COVID-19 cases in India touched 50. Of these 50 cases, three have been cured and discharged while the remaining are active cases.\nFour of the six COVID-19 cases that were reported on March 10 were detected in Bengaluru, and two in Pune. All these patients had a travel history to the US or Dubai--two locations where coronavirus cases have been on a rise.\nThe 50th COVID-19 case in India was reported 41 days after the first case was reported in Kerala on January 30. The first patient was a student studying at a university in Wuhan, China (the epicentre of the global coronavirus outbreak) and was spending her vacation at her home in Thrissur district.\nIn a span of four days, two more people tested positive for COVID-19 in Kerala. They too were students who had returned from China on vacation.\nWith the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India crossing 50, we take a look at the first 50 cases to understand the geographical spread of coronavirus outbreak in India and the possible manner in which these patients contracted the viral infection.\nGeographical spread: 50 cases, 12 states & 18 cities\nThe map below depicts the geographical spread of the coronavirus outbreak in India.\nThe storymap below gives a gist of the cases reported in each city/district and whether the patient(s) had any travel history to a coronavirus-hit country or whether they contracted COVID-19 locally.\nTransmission: The travel history of COVID-19 cases\nOur analysis of the first 50 COVID-19 cases shows that a majority of them had a travel history to a country that was already affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Analysing statements issued by the Union Health Ministry, we found that 39 of the first 50 COVID-19 cases in India had a foreign travel history, while 11 cases contracted the infection through local transmission i.e. in India.\nMost of the cases (23) had a travel history to Italy. This included the 16 Italian nationals who tested positive in Jaipur.\nBesides this, four COVID-19 cases had a travel history to Iran and an equal number to the US; three cases had a travel history to China and an equal number to Dubai; one patient had travelled to Oman and one to Thailand and Singapore.\nMeanwhile, the 11 cases that contracted the viral infection in India included:\nThis situation demands caution.\nOf the 11 cases of local transmission, 10 were where the patients came in contact with somebody who had travelled abroad. In other words, these patients are the ones who fell ill without having visited any coronavirus-hit country.\nIt will be important to see if such cases continue to get reported in the coming weeks.\nTimeline of 1st 50 cases\nBesides them, an Indian driver who was hired by the group also tests positive for COVID-19.\nSix COVID-19 cases were also reported in Agra. All of them were people who had been exposed to the Delhi patient detected on March 2.\nOf the five cases, the patient in Delhi did not have any travel history outside India. Health officials said she contracted the viral infection from the techie who tested positive in Gurgaon on March 5.\nThe three-year-old girl in Ernakulam and the patient in Punjab had a travel history to Italy; the patient in Jammu (a 63-year-old woman) had a travel history to Iran.\nThe two patients in Pune had a travel history to Dubai.\nPrecautions you can take\nAs per WHO, you should observe the following precautions:\n'
'888888,0,According to the report of Deutsche Welle today, the sequela of the new crown: the loss of lung function by 30% leads to testicular infertility? The novel coronavirus pneumonia has spread to over 100 countries worldwide. Besides the epidemic prevention, the sequelae caused by the virus have also attracted much attention.\nNovel coronavirus pneumonia has been recorded in Hongkong since, and about 70 people have recovered from the disease, according to the comprehensive media report of the 130 media. The center for infectious diseases of Margaret Hospital analyzed the data of the first batch of more than 10 discharged patients. Among them, 2-3 convalescents were short of breath when they were walking fast, they could not do exercise as usual, or even could not do the previous work. It is estimated that "lung function damage is not half, but it is 20-30%.\nZeng Dexian, chairman of the clinical treatment task force of the medical authority and medical director of the infectious diseases center, explained that viral pneumonia can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, which needs to be treated with drugs. After recovery, there may be scars, which will hinder breathing when the scar tissue becomes hard. He said that in 2003, the recovery of SARS patients also had poor pulmonary function. At present, we are still observing the long-term impact of the new coronavirus on the patients. The authorities will take a pulmonary function test and arrange physical treatment for the rehabilitation patients during the follow-up. They also suggest that the patients do more lung expansion exercises such as swimming, running, etc., which is believed to help improve their pulmonary function. As of March 11, the hospital has received 26 patients diagnosed with the new coronavirus, 6 of whom are seriously ill, 5 of whom need to stay in the intensive care department, and 2 have died so far. Of the 26 confirmed patients, 21 received drug treatment, while the other 5 were younger and had no obvious symptoms. They were expected to recover on their own.\nNovel coronavirus, China\'s Hubei provincial government website, published an article in March 12th, which quoted professor Li Yufeng from Huazhong University of Science and Technology\'s Tongji Hospital Reproductive Medicine Center as the main cause of the new coronavirus infection, which could damage the function of the testis in theory. Novel coronavirus infection has not been studied to confirm whether the infection of the new coronavirus affects male fertility, but the new crown virus is highly similar to the SARS virus. The infection is the same as the invasion cell receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Although SARS virus has not been detected in testis, "SARS infection can still cause severe immune damage to testis, orchitis and extensive destruction of reproductive related cells". Therefore, theoretically, it is speculated that new crown infection can cause testis damage, affect sperm production and androgen synthesis, and seriously cause male infertilit。\nAccording to the research team\'s recommendations, the age of men who have been infected with the virus need to be admitted to the hospital for semen quality and hormone level tests after recovery in order to deal with the problem as early as possible. After the article was published, it caused hot discussion on the Internet, and the article was removed from the shelves today.\nAccording to the report, "surging news" contacted Li Yufeng through Tongji Hospital. In response to the inquiry, he pointed out that the new coronavirus infection may cause testicular damage "theoretically based". The main purpose of the article is to remind patients to check after cure, but stressed that relevant research is still in progress. Asked if there is any testicular injury, the head of the hospital responded: "the clinical time is not enough without such a fast speed."\nAccording to a paper published on preprints on February 21 local time, 2019 coronavirus infection may inhibit the reproduction related functions of targeted cells and lead to failure of spermatogenesis, the paper continued. Both authors are from institutes affiliated to the National Institutes of health. Their papers have not been peer reviewed or published in official journals. Qi Lihua, Chi Xiaochun, et al. From Peking University Medical Department, were cited in two papers published in January and February 2007. They pointed out that male patients with orchitis were caused by SARS, and there were many causes, among which the autoimmune damage caused by SARS virus might be one of the main causes.\nAccording to Hong Kong 01, ye Weijin, a urologist in Hong Kong, agreed that "in theory, the new crown virus can infect testicles", but since the virus can run in patients\' bodies for a period of time, it is recommended to wait six months to one year after recovery before accepting testicular function related tests'

The measure is a response to growing concern about the outbreak which, inside and outside China, has already killed 17 people.\nResidents were advised not to leave the city, and the decision was made to close the airports and train stations for exit travel.\nBus, metro, boat and long-distance transport networks will cease to operate from the 10h00 local hours (2h00 in Lisbon) of the 23rd day of January.\nAfter the death toll almost doubled in the space of one day, the Chinese authorities claim that the country is now in the "most critical" phase of prevention and control.\n"Just don\'t go to Wuhan. And those in the city, please do not leave,"appealed to the Deputy Minister of the National Health Commission, Li Bin, in one of the first public interventions since the outbreak began.\nThe closure of public transport takes place in a week when millions of Chinese are preparing to travel, to celebrate the Lunar New Year.\nAccording to the latest update, there are 440 confirmed cases of infection with 2019-nCoV.\n'
'888888,0,A man from China is the first to test positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, with another Chinese national here in an unrelated case also likely to have contracted it. \n The 66-year-old Wuhan resident arrived in the country with nine travelling companions on Monday, and stayed at Shangri-La\'s Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said at a briefing last night. \n The announcement of Singapore\'s first confirmed case came amid intensified efforts here to keep the novel coronavirus at bay, including temperature screening at land and sea checkpoints starting this morning, in addition to ongoing checks at Changi Airport. \n A 53-year-old woman, also a Chinese national but not with the group of 10, came up positive in preliminary tests, which were awaiting confirmation. \n In addition, the man\'s son, 37, a suspected case, has been admitted to hospital, while the rest of the group have left the country. \n All three were in stable condition, and there was no evidence that the virus had spread to the community, the ministry said. \n After widening the net to include temperature screening for all air travellers from China, the number of suspected cases in Singapore went up. In total, there have been 28 suspected cases aged one to 78 years, said MOH. Seven people have been ruled out. \n "All measures will be taken to contain its possible spread," said the ministry\'s director of communicable diseases Vernon Lee. \n But more cases are expected, given the large number infected in China and high travel volume from the country to Singapore. \n As for the first case here, the man was in isolation and was no longer a risk to the public, Associate Professor Lee stressed. "There is no need for the general public to panic or take any special measures." \n Close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined\n. \n Yesterday, in measures to shore up defences against the virus, the newly formed multi-ministry task force decided at its first meeting to enhance border control and intensify screening. Measures have also been stepped up in places such as hospitals, schools and army camps. \n Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who heads the task force with National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, said that the effort was multi-tiered. \n "First, we have to ensure that we do what we can in our defensive measures in terms of our border controls, temperature screening and so on, but at the same time, we have multi-layers of defence, including our clinics, hospitals, health institutions and healthcare workers who are at the front line." \n Finally, he said, it was important that everyone protected themselves by observing personal hygiene and behaving in a socially responsible way. \n Speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore had been preparing for a new viral outbreak since severe acute respiratory syndrome hit in 2003. \n This included doing a thorough review of infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and scientific testing and capabilities. "And I think we are much better prepared now," he said. \n China, too, had made progress in dealing with public health emergencies, he noted. \n The country has taken the unprecedented move of putting extensive travel restrictions on cities at the heart of the outbreak, which has killed at least 17 and infected more than 600 people, with cases surfacing all over the world. \n Singaporeans are advised to avoid travel to the whole of Hubei province, in view of the travel restrictions China has imposed on Huanggang, Chibi, Xiantao and Ezhou, in addition to Wuhan, and to be cautious and pay attention to hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n The virus, now known as 2019-nCoV, is mutating and can now be passed from person to person\n. Infections are expected to spike over the Chinese New Year weekend, with hundreds of millions of travellers on the move. \n • Additional reporting by Timothy Goh and Aw Cheng Wei\n'
'888888,0,The number of patients with the novel corona virus behind lung disease in China has risen sharply again. Four infections have been confirmed in Germany. The three new cases announced on Tuesday evening are related to the first patient in Bavaria who had contracted it from a colleague from China. In the People\'s Republic the number of diseases increased within one day to Wednesday at 1459. This covers more than 6000 cases. Other 26 patients died in China. Thus the total number of deaths climbed to 132.\nWhile there are a little more than 80-year-old infections outside the People\'s Republic, the Health Commission in Beijing counted patients alone in China until Wednesday around 5951. There are almost ten thousand suspicious cases. The Commission even reported cases of 5974, but counted 23 infections in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao. Beijing regards these territories as part of the People\'s Republic. Therefore, 1239 patients are severely ill. Deaths are usually older patients with pre-existing illnesses.\nOutside the People\'s Republic there are also people with the new virus in Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the USA, Australia or South Korea. In Europe, four cases have also been confirmed in France. Most of the patients were previously in China. However, there are also increasingly infections that have occurred outside in contact with travellers from China, such as most recently in Japan and Taiwan. Thus, the Beijing government has advised its citizens to postpone travel abroad for the time being.\nIn China, the eleven million metropolis of Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei in Central China are particularly hard hit. Around 45 million people were shot to death there. Flights and short- and long-distance transport have been suspended\nYeah. Japan began to bring back first compatriots from the area. A charter machine with 206 people from Wuhan landed in Tokyo on Wednesday.\nThe passengers did not use the normal flight terminal for regular passengers, but were taken to a medical facility in a special bus. More flights will follow, as around 650-Japanese want to return. Germany and other countries, such as the USA, South Korea or India, are also considering, or are already planning, concrete similar recovery actions. In Wuhan there are about 90-Germans. How many of them want to go to Germany is unclear. Australia, too, wants to expel citizens from the crisis region, but to quarantine them for a 14-day period on Christmas Island.\nAccording to the Bavarian Ministry of Health, as in the first case, the three new patients in Germany are also employees of the car supplier Webasto in Stockdorf (Bavaria). "It has been decided that the three new patients at the Munich clinic Schwabing will also be admitted stationary and medically monitored and isolated," the ministry said. "Some other contact persons are currently undergoing a test to see if there is also an infection with the Coronavirus."\nBecause of the infections, Webasto closes its headquarters in the Upper Bavarian village of Stockdorf, a part of Gauting, until Sunday. Until then, employees of the company headquarters should also not travel to national and international locations, as the company announced on Tuesday evening. Webasto is a major supplier for the automotive industry with a total of 13 400 employees at 50-locations worldwide. There are twelve locations in China, one of them in Wuhan. The infected Chinese woman who had come to the company seminar had contracted it with her parents in the city. She did not develop symptoms until returning to China on the 23rd. January\nYeah.\nIn the fight against the virus, new reporting obligations are being imposed on airlines and hospitals in Germany, according to Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). In the case of flights from China, pilots should inform the Tower of the health of the passengers prior to landing. Travellers from China should provide information on their flight, whereabouts and accessibility in the next thirty days in forms. Clinics will also have to report cases of Coronavirus suspicion to the Robert Koch Institute in the future, not just confirmed cases.\nThe first patient with the new virus in Germany, a 33-year-old from Landsberg am Lech district, is being treated at the isolation station at the Munich clinic Schwabing, as Clemens Wendtner, chief physician at the clinic, said. He\'s all right. The incubation period is up to two weeks in the case of lung disease. However, infected people are already contagious even before they show symptoms, which makes it particularly difficult to contain the virus.\nThe new virus 2019-nCoV originated probably from a market in Wuhan, where it probably jumped from there traded wild animals to humans. Symptoms, including dry cough, fever and shortness of breath, can be alleviated with medication. According to current experts, lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, in some cases even without symptoms. The new pathogen is very similar to the virus behind the Sars pandemic 2002/2003, which also broke out in China. Back then, 8000-year-old people were sick. Barely 800 died.\nAustralian scientists have been breeding the Coronavirus in the laboratory. The Peter Doherty Institute for Infections and Immunity in Melbourne reported this on Wednesday. It is now possible to work together with other institutes and the World Health Organisation on an antidote. (dpa)\n'

'888888,0,NEW YORK — A mother who was infected with the coronavirus couldn’t smell her baby’s full diaper. Cooks who can usually name every spice in a restaurant dish can’t smell curry or garlic, and food tastes bland. Others say they can’t pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the foul odour of kitty litter. \n Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of infection. \n On Friday (March 20), British ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease’s spread. The published data is limited, but doctors are concerned enough to raise warnings. \n “We really want to raise awareness that this is a sign of infection and that anyone who develops loss of sense of smell should self-isolate,” Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, wrote in an email. “It could contribute to slowing transmission and save lives.” \n She and Professor Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK, a group representing ear, nose and throat doctors in Britain, issued a joint statement urging health care workers to use personal protective equipment when treating any patients who have lost their senses of smell, and advised against performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus. \n Two ear, nose and throat specialists in Britain who have been infected with the coronavirus are in critical condition, Dr Hopkins said. Earlier reports from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus first emerged, had warned that ear, nose and throat specialists as well as eye doctors were infected and dying in large numbers, Hopkins said. \n The British physicians cited reports from other countries indicating that significant numbers of coronavirus patients experienced anosmia, saying that in South Korea, where testing has been widespread, 30 per cent of 2,000 patients who tested positive experienced anosmia as their major presenting symptom (these were mild cases). \n The American Academy of Otolaryngology on Sunday posted information on its website saying that mounting anecdotal evidence indicates that lost or reduced sense of smell and loss of taste are significant symptoms associated with Covid-19, and that they have been seen in patients who ultimately tested positive with no other symptoms. \n Dr Rachel Kaye, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Rutgers, said colleagues in New Rochelle, New York, which has been the center of an outbreak, first alerted her to the smell loss associated with the coronavirus, sharing that patients who had first complained of anosmia later tested positive for the coronavirus. “This raised a lot of alarms for me personally,” Dr Kaye said, because those patients “won’t know to self quarantine.” \n “Most ENTs have on their own accord tried to scale down,” she said, adding that her department at Rutgers had already started using personal protective equipment and stopped performing nonessential exams. \n In the areas of Italy most heavily affected by the virus, doctors say they have concluded that loss of taste and smell is an indication that a person who otherwise seems healthy is in fact carrying the virus and may be spreading it to others. \n “Almost everybody who is hospitalised has this same story,” said Dr Marco Metra, chief of the cardiology department at the main hospital in Brescia, where 700 of 1,200 inpatients have the coronavirus. “You ask about the patient’s wife or husband. And the patient says, ‘My wife has just lost her smell and taste but otherwise she is well.’ So she is likely infected, and she is spreading it with a very mild form.” \n A study from South Korea, where widespread testing has been done, found that 30 per cent of some 2,000 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus reported experiencing anosmia. \n Dr Hendrik Streeck, a German virologist from the University of Bonn who went from house to house in the country’s Heinsberg district to interview coronavirus patients, has said in interviews that at least two-thirds of the more than 100 he talked to with mild disease reported experiencing loss of smell and taste lasting several days. \n Another physician who studied a cluster of coronavirus patients in Germany said in an email that roughly half of the patients had experienced a smell or taste disorder, and that the sensory loss usually presented after the first symptoms of respiratory illness, but could be used to distinguish people who should be tested. \n Dr Clemens Wendtner, a professor of medicine at the Academic Teaching Hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, said that the patients regained their ability to smell after a few days or weeks, and that the loss occurred regardless of how sick they got or whether they were congested. Using nasal drops or sprays did not help, Wendtner said. \n Several American patients who have had symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, but who have not been tested or are still awaiting test results, described losing their senses of smell and taste, even though their noses were clear and they were not congested. \n Mr Andrew Berry, 30, developed a fever and body aches about 10 days ago, and then a sore throat and debilitating headaches. He tested negative for influenza and has not gotten the result of a coronavirus test taken four days ago, but his physician was convinced that he had the virus, he said. \n Now, Mr Berry said, he literally cannot smell the coffee. \n “Even with a clear nose, I just realised I couldn’t smell the food that I was cooking, and I couldn’t taste the food that I was making,” said Mr Berry, a tattoo artist based in Orlando, Florida. He was cooking a plantain dish with onions and vinegar, yet he could not smell it. \n Ms Amy Plattmier, a woman from Brooklyn, was not tested for the coronavirus during a recent illness, but her husband then became sick and had a positive test. Ms Plattmier said she usually had a very sensitive nose, but now could barely smell anything — not the bleach she was using to clean the counters, which usually makes her feel nauseated, or the dog’s accident in the bathroom, which she cleaned up. \n Mr Berry has also lost some weight, because he has not had much of an appetite. “Hopefully it’s not a prolonged effect,” he said. “I can imagine it changes the quality of life.” THE NEW YORK TIMES \n '
'888888,0,On a cruise ship under quarantine in front of Japan 41 more passengers have contracted the Coronavirus. The Japanese authorities reported that the number of infected passengers had increased to 61. Earlier on, 20 patients had been taken off the Diamond Princess.\nAccording to the German Embassy in Tokyo, ten persons of German nationality are among the total of about 3.700 passengers and crew members of the cruise ship. According to the embassy, however, the Germans on board had not been infected, and they were doing well under the circumstances, the embassy said.\nThe Japanese authorities have the ship until 19th. In February, the virus was quarantined to prevent further spread on the mainland. In addition, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that Japan would refuse entry to foreign passengers of another cruise ship with the aim of Japan. The reason for this was a suspicious case on board the Westerdam, which was on its way from Hong Kong to Okinawa. The new regulation will enter into force on Friday. Thousands of passengers and crew members were also isolated on another cruise ship anchored outside Hong Kong called World Dream.\nMost cases of Coronavirus occur in China. There the number of deaths increased to 636 until Friday, and more than 31.000 people with respiratory disease have become infected worldwide.\nPolitically sensitive to the Chinese government is the death of Doctor Li Wenliang, announced on Thursday. Li had warned early of the outbreak of the new virus. The death of the 34-year-old ophthalmologist, who died of lung disease himself on Thursday evening, has caused great sympathy throughout the country.\nYeah. With the agreement of the Party\'s Central Committee, the State Supervisory Commission sent an investigation team to Wuhan, as the authority announced on Friday.\nHis death symbolizes for many Chinese the consequences of inaction or slow reaction of the authorities to the outbreak. The investigation is about questions of the people about this incident, he said. Li Wenliang was in his 30s. In December, in an online discussion group of doctors and students, citing a growing number of mysterious viral outbreaks in Wuhan, warned of a recurrence of the Sars virus, which led 17-year ago to the pandemic of 8.000 infected and 774 dead.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, every third person has died of it.\nYeah. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment must be\nYeah. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nEight participants in the chat group were then summoned and warned by the police about the spread of "rumors". They also had to sign that they were not revealing anything more about the outbreak. A few days later, the doctor infected himself with a patient.\nThe number of new infections with the Coronavirus in China seems to have stabilised slightly, but remains very high. From Thursday to Friday, authorities reported more than 3.140 new cases, increasing the total number of confirmed diseases in China to 31.161. It was the second day in a row that the reported infections did not exceed those of the previous day. Within one day, however, 73 patients died again from the new type of lung disease, as many as the day before. So far there have been 636 Coronavirus deaths in China.\nWhether a further trend in infections can already be identified with the new figures is open, as statistics can also fluctuate with the number of ongoing investigations. In addition, more than 26.000 suspect cases are still registered. The course of the epidemic is difficult to predict from the point of view of the World Health Organisation. Outside the particularly affected areas in Central China, the situation in China seems to be relatively stable at the moment, said WHO expert Michael Ryan in Geneva\nYeah.\nA newborn in the city of Wuhan, the starting point of the virus, was found only 36 hours after birth. These are the most recent known patients.\n"The baby was separated from its mother immediately after birth and fed artificially. There was no close contact with the parents, yet he was diagnosed with the disease,"said Zeng Lingkong, director of neonatal diseases at Wuhan Children\'s Hospital, Chinese TV. Other sick mothers would have had children who responded negatively to tests, Zeng said. It is therefore not clear whether the virus can be transmitted in the uterus.\nOn the edge of the most heavily affected Chinese city of Wuhan, construction workers have now completed the second fastest-built hospital. In both hospitals, 2.500 beds are available for Corona patients. Patients with mild symptoms were transferred to temporary hospital camps in sports arenas, exhibition halls and other public places.\nThere was a 13-year-old in Germany the day before. Fall. Eleven of them are related to the Bavarian company Webasto, where employees had contracted infection from a colleague from China. Two returnees from China were also tested positively. The most recent viral findings came from the 38-year-old wife of one of the patients from Bavaria, as reported by the Bavarian Ministry of Health. Two of the couple\'s children were also infected. In the third child, a baby, the virus has not yet been detected.\n'

'888888,0,The Chinese Embassy in Singapore has responded to an article written by veteran diplomat Bilahari Kausikan, which touched on how the Covid-19 outbreak starkly highlighted China\'s strengths and weaknesses. \n The article, which Mr Bilahari originally wrote for Canadian international affairs magazine Global Brief\'s blog, was reprinted in The Straits Times on Monday with the headline, "China\'s inflection point and the CCP\'s fundamental dilemma". \n The Chinese embassy spokesman said the article by Mr Bilahari, a former diplomat who is now chairman of the Middle East Institute at the National University of Singapore, was similar to the "stereotype cliche of Western anti-China voices" in its misinterpretation of China\'s political system and the leadership system under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). \n The spokesman said that at a difficult time when the Chinese people are making sacrifices to fight the Covid-19 outbreak, "the sense of justice of the author to ideologically denigrate China and sell his long-held prejudice and even hostility towards China has to be questioned". Whether a country\'s developmental strategy is right depends on that country\'s situation, said the spokesman, citing China\'s progress over the past 70 years to become the world\'s second-largest economy, and lifting over 800 million people out of poverty. \n Those achievements were made under the leadership of the CCP and the "system of socialism with Chinese characteristics", benefiting not just China but the rest of the world. "Though Mr Bilahari himself did not deny China\'s great achievements, he still criticised the political system and the leadership system that created them. Actually it is logically self-contradictory," added the spokesman. \n He added that the country has united around the CCP Central Committee headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, its general secretary, since the 18th National Congress in 2012. "China is striving hard to modernise the system and capacity for governance. All constructive comments and suggestions are welcomed, but arrogance and prejudice through coloured glasses are unacceptable," said the spokesman. \n He also said the Covid-19 coronavirus is "the enemy to all mankind", and that Mr Xi is "in full command, and the whole country is united as one" in battling the epidemic, bringing "positive results". \n The spokesman questioned why the same criticism was not levelled when the H1N1 flu originated in North America and spread globally in 2009, saying: "At the moment, what the world needs most is unity and trust, not the political virus that keeps people at bay." \n '

'888888,0,Now the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV has also appeared in Germany. Health systems are well prepared for this. In the country of origin, however, thousands are infected and it is still uncertain how dangerous the organism is. There are no medicines to treat the sick. Rolf Hilgenfeld is trying to help. The biochemist has been on his way to China since last week.\nTIME ONLINE: Mr Hilgenfeld, what are you actually doing?\nRolf Hilgenfeld: I want to find out if the inhibitors we developed at the University of Lubeck work as well against the new Coronavirus as against Sars and Mers viruses. I\'m here looking for collaborators who have cell cultures with the new virus to test the substances on. However, our substances are still at an experimental stage. Unfortunately, they are still a long way from being used as a medicine in the current outbreak.\nTIME ONLINE: Still no medicine for the new virus?\nHilgenfeld: No, not yet approved, because 2019-nCoV has just been discovered. However, experience has been gained with various medicines during the Sars outbreak 2002 and 2003. And a combination of two substances proved particularly promising in the first clinical trials: the combination of the active substances lopinavir and ritonavir. It\'s actually anti-HIV medicine.\nTIME ONLINE: You\'re saying you should give Coronavirus patients aids?\nThis is how it is. Especially in outbreaks such as these, there are regular attempts to re-dedicate already authorised medicines. This has the advantage that these products have already been tested intensively on humans and can therefore be considered safe. This saves you years of testing, because usually when you break out, time is of the essence. Now it takes far too long to develop something new\nYeah. And Lopinavir and ritonavir are only allowed against HIV.\nTIME ONLINE: How do these medicines work?\nHelpful field: In order to multiply, RNA viruses, like 2019-nCoV, form very large protein molecules. They must then be cut into individual components by certain enzymes in order for the virus to multiply. That\'s what you\'re trying to prevent. You can do that by inhibiting the enzymes. The good news is, these enzymes are very similar to the individual coronavirus. We investigated this in Lubeck before the Sars outbreak 2002. Back then, Coronaviruses were still considered unimportant to humans. They thought they\'d cause a cold. At the time, many even advised me to stop these "unimportant" works. And shortly after the Sars pandemic began, we were the only ones who had ever clarified three-dimensional structures of coronavirus proteins. On this basis, we have already developed a substance that can inhibit coronavirus. We were able to suggest that a medicine that should actually work against rhinoviruses, the typical "flu viruses", should also be effective against coronavirus after slight changes.\nTIME ONLINE: If so, why can\'t you use the substance in the current outbreak?\nHelp field: It is still in experimental condition. In order to be able to use it, it has to be developed into a medicine in years of research. When we wanted to run more tests back then, the Sars outbreak was over and we had no patients to test the substance on. This is also a fundamental problem for all research in this field.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation WHO a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan\nYeah. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death\nYeah. Because it\'s a viral disease, antibiotics don\'t help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere\'s no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nONLINE TIME: What do you mean?\nHelp field: First you have to show in an animal experiment that a substance is safe and then that it works. But you can\'t just infect a mouse with coronavirus, you have to plant an extra human receptor in the mouse, you have to "humanize" it. It takes months.\nYeah. And only then will the examinations of patients begin, which will last for years to come. And when you finally get there, there are no more patients to try the drugs on because the outbreak is over. This is why it is difficult to find funding. And the pharmaceutical industry is not interested in coronavirus. Even the 8.000 Sars cases at the time are not a lucrative market for companies. That is also why we now have no effective medicine against the new virus.\nONLINE TIME: Viruses change their heritage when they multiply. Does that also make it so difficult to develop an effective medicine?\nHelpful field: It is sometimes read that Coronaviruses mutate particularly quickly. That\'s not true at all. The virus does not change as quickly as influenza viruses, for example. The mutation rates are lower. This is because Coronaviruses are quite effective in correcting the errors that occur when they multiply. So that\'s not the reason why there\'s still no authorized drug for coronavirus. In fact, it is not so difficult to develop one if only there were more support for research.\nTIME ONLINE: Are there any other medicines besides lopinavir and ritonavir that have already been tested and would be readily available?\nHelp field: I think another medicine is promising: Remdesivir. It was originally developed against the Ebola virus. In cell cultures, however, it also works against other RNA viruses, for example against Sars and Mers Coronaviruses. That\'s why they call it a broad-spectrum drug. I think it is possible that Remdesivir could also work against the new 2019-CnoV. And I assume that the WHO will also recommend the drug in the current outbreak.\nTIME ONLINE: What are the chances that it actually works?\nHelp field: You have to see this\nYeah. Finally, unlike the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, it has never been used in humans against coronavirs. In this respect, it can be described as experimental, but it has already been tested for its safety in humans. Both drugs, and perhaps also interferon beta, should now be tested as soon as possible in clinical studies to know if they work.\nTIME ONLINE: Could this stop the current Coronavirus outbreak?\nHelpfeld: It is difficult to predict because many aspects of the outbreak have not yet been clarified. But after everything that\'s been known about these drugs so far, I think it\'s possible to break the chain of infection and stop the outbreak.\nONLINE TIME: Treatment is one thing. In addition, there would be the option of immunising people with a vaccine against the Coronavirus. What\'s the status?\nHelpful field: Currently several organizations around the world are working on a vaccine, for example the Chinese Center for Disease Control, but also the National Institutes of Health in the USA. They seem to hope to be able to start tests on patients in the first half of the year. That would be very quick. Sars took almost two years to start the first clinical trials with vaccines after the virus was decoded.\nTIME ONLINE: Could vaccine candidates developed against Sars and Mers serve as the basis for a vaccine against the new Coronavirus?\nAuxiliary field: The aim of the vaccines is the so-called spike protein, which you have to think of as spikes on the viral envelope. And, unlike the enzymes that are attacked by the AIDS medicines Lopinavir/ritonavir, they differ significantly depending on the type of virus. The spike protein of the Wuhan virus is only 51 percent identical to that of the Sars-Coronavirus. This makes a vaccine that works against many coronary viruses equally unlikely.\nYeah. Even if it is quick: it will take months for a specific vaccine against 2019-nCoV to be developed and ready for use. Our best chance against the virus right now is the drugs we already have.\nRead all about the Coronavirus outbreak on this page.\n'

'888888,0,For Matthias Denneburg everything went as usual: the exhibition stands of his clients were finished, the assembly teams were booked, the cars rented, hotel rooms reserved. But then the trade fair in Cologne cancelled the hardware fair and moved it to spring 2021. Because of the "worldwide situation around the occurrence of the Coronavirus". A third of the exhibitors were from China, where the corona epidemic began. Three of them were clients of Zenit Messebau, Denneburg\'s company.\nThe rejection in Cologne is by no means the only one. For the same reason, the Frankfurt Trade Fair cancelled the Light + Building Building Building Building Building Technology Exhibition and moved it to September. In Augsburg, Denneburg\'s people were stopped in the middle of building stands for a meeting of an electricity wholesaler because the organiser canceled the fair. The Geneva car dealership could not take place either, it is said, from industry circles.\nThe Coronavirus is becoming a risk for many companies, and it is precisely the medium-sized ones that could cause millions of damage. The volume of orders for the hardware fair alone "is in the six digit range", says Denneburg. Today, a booth is a high-tech building made of high-quality materials with ceiling installations, LED walls, screens, VR installations. The company from Cologne is now trying to limit the damage: "What we could stop, we stopped." Whoever has to bear what costs now, he is clarifying with the clients.\nSimilarly, Ute Yiannakis, Managing Director of the Exhibition Facility Profile & Design from Bad Honnef. The exhibition stands are in stock for the 200-Chinese exhibitors at the Frankfurt fair Light + Building, as she says. An order volume of approximately 180.000 euro. The exhibition has been cancelled since Monday.\nThe industry is heavily uncertaiYeah. The impact of the Corona crisis on trade fair construction companies, trade fair organisers and event agencies is "already dramatic", says Jan Kalbfleisch, Managing Director of the Famab Branch Association, who sees his member companies before difficult times." The more international the trade fair is, the higher the likelihood that it will be cancelled,"he says. There is no compelling reason for this at the moment." According to the Ministry of Health and Robert Koch-Institut, we currently have a low to moderate risk,"Kalbmeat says, complaining:"Currently, the limit to hysteria has been crossed. We hope for the return of reason."\nIn Frankfurt, the Light + building failed to meet official medical requirements. Exhibition staff from China should be fully interviewed and checked repeatedly." The Health Department asked us to carry out a multi-stage health check, which could not be carried out by the fair,"says Trade Fair spokesman Markus Quint. The Authority did not request a refusal, the trade fair decided to do so itself.\nSuch decisions are also accompanied by the risk that exhibitors may leave in turn, which means that the fair loses its attractiveness. In this way, the Barcelona Mobile Radio Fair had recently shrunk until the organiser cancelled it.\nOne of Germany\'s biggest industry shows is still resisting the virus. The Berlin International Tourism Exchange is due to open on Wednesday. On Friday, however, the Federal Government\'s Crisis Staff wants to discuss ITB and balance health protection against economic interests. About 400-exhibitors from Italy, the current Corona\'s main risk area in Europe, are said to have already cancelled, according to the trade fair management, who also points out that only 16-000 exhibitors would come from mainland ChinaYeah.\nThe Tourism Fair wants to be prepared against the virus: donors for disinfectants should be present at all inputs and outputs, outlets should point to protective measures, the cleaning intervals of sanitary facilities will be increased. All exhibitors, trade visitors and journalists must declare in writing prior to admission whether they have been in Corona risk regions during the last two weeks, the incubation period of the virus, or whether they have had contact with such people.\nBut all this remains an attempt to minimize the risk of infection, because the fair cannot force anyone to truthfully answer the questionnaires." We do not expect visitors to give false information,"says trade fair spokeswoman Britta Wolters."We do not expect visitors to give false information." We appeal to common sense and the responsibility of all."The need for information is only temporary anyway: at 7th. and 8. In March, when the trade fair opens for private visitors, these controls should be abolished, at least as planned to date.\nAccording to the Berlin trade fair, Fruit Logistica, the main trade fair for fruit and vegetables in February already had such protective measures. Here half of the Chinese producers said no. After the big tourism fair ITB will follow rather smaller events in Berlin, the next trade fair is at the end of April. Then comes the ILA Air Show. Large events similar to ITB will not be held until September.\nIt could be a positive thing for exhibitors and exhibitors that the exhibition centres still have free periods later in the year in which they can now put cancelled events." It is half good that the hardware fair will take place next year,"says the Cologne Messebauer Denneburg,"then turnover only shifts."Ute Yiannakis of the company from Bad Honnef has contractually insured against economic damage:"We demand fifty percent of the order amount already one month before the fair starts"This should at least cover the cost of the preparations.\nBut the postponement has limits, as Harald Koter of the trade fair organisers\'association says: "This is not an easy process, the dates have to be in tune with the industry." The toy fair Nuremberg at the end of January is consciously located at the beginning of the year, because it is focused on the Christmas business.
