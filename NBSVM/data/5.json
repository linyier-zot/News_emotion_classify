        "news_content_translate_en": "(Updates with measures in casinos)\nBy Donny Kwok\nHONG KONG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed on Wednesday its first case of pneumonia linked to an outbreak of a newly identified coronavirus and tightened temperature screening measures in casinos and around the city.\nThe death toll from the flu-like coronavirus in China rose to nine on Wednesday with 440 confirmed cases.\nThe virus, originating in Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.\nThe Macau case involves a 52-year-old Wuhan businesswoman who reported to hospital on Tuesday, said Macau Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture Ao Leong Lu, who vicechairs a committee set up to respond to the virus.\nThe woman took a high-speed train to the Chinese city of Zhuhai on Jan 19, then a shuttlebus to Macau. She had dinner with two friends, then went to the hotel and spent a long time in casinos. She was in a stable condition in an isolation ward. Her two friends were also being monitored and were in isolation.\nSpeaking at a news conference in Macau, Ao and other officials said authorities were coordinating with six gaming enterprises to introduce temperature screening machines at all entrances into casinos.\nA total of 405 guest entrances and 47 staff entrances have already been provided with portable screening devices and all casino staff had to wear surgical masks. All performers and staff at the events hosted across Macau will be screened.\nEntry points into Macau will also have temperature checks and visitors will be asked to fill in a health declaration form. Bus stops, taxi stands and wet markets will be cleaned more frequently.\nThe tourist-magnet casino industry in Macau, which returned to Chinese rule in 1999, accounts for more than 80% of the revenue in the city of 600,000 people\n. Macau is a popular Lunar New Year destination for mainland Chinese.\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses named because of the crown-like spikes on their surfaces that cause respiratory illnesses ranging from the common cold to the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The first case of the virus has now been reported in US with official confirmation that a person arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.\nThe patient was hospitalised on Sunday, after arriving in Seattle from Wuhan on January 15, officials at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said\n.\nLi said the figures from the commission show a total of 2,197 close contacts have been traced. A total of 1,394 are under medical observation while 765 people have been discharged.\nAll of the deaths were reported in central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared in the city of Wuhan.\nChina yet to confirm the exact source of the virus.\n\"Though the transmission route of the virus is yet to be fully understood, there is a possibility of virus mutation and a risk of further spread of the epidemic,\" Li said.\nThe warning comes as millions of people across China are travelling within the country and abroad for the Lunar New Year week-long holiday.\nThe holiday season began on January 10 and would last for 40 days.\nOfficially, China will declare week-long holiday from January 24.\nThe Wuhan Health Commission said it would authorise medical institutions to quarantine all patients and people in close contact with them as a prevention and control measure, Li said.\nOn Tuesday, the National Health Commission upgraded the coronavirus to a Class B infectious disease, but said it would use the stricter control measures for a Class A disease to handle the outbreak, meaning any infection nationwide must be reported within two hours and monitored.\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization, which is holding an emergency meeting on Wednesday, will consider declaring an international public health emergency over the virus -- as it did with swine flu and Ebola.\nSuch a declaration, if made, will be seen as an urgent call for a coordinated international response in view of fears that millions of Chinese are travelling at home and abroad for the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival holidays starting from January 24.\nThe week-long festival triggers biggest mass migration, clogging road, rail and air networks every year.\nIndia has already issued a travel warning.\nSeveral countries started screening travellers coming from China, especially from Wuhan to detect symptoms like fever\n.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang confirmed on Monday about Chinese official's attendance at the emergency meeting of the International Health Regulation called by the WHO.\n",

Many also venture abroad. \n CONTAINMENT \n On Wednesday, the commission announced measures to contain the disease, including sterilisation and ventilation at airports and bus stations, as well as inside planes and trains. \n People are being urged to wash their hands regularly, avoid crowded places, open windows to allow in fresh air, and wear a mask if they have a cough. \n Anyone with a cough or fever should go to a hospital, Mr Li said. \n At Beijing's main international airport on Wednesday, the majority of people were wearing masks. \n In Wuhan, Mayor Zhou Xianwang urged residents not to leave the city and visitors to stay away if there is no reason for them to come. \n \"If it's not necessary we suggest that people don't come to Wuhan,\" Mr Wang told state broadcaster CCTV\n. \n Police were conducting spot checks for live poultry or wild animals in vehicles leaving and entering the city, state media said. \n The local government has cancelled public activities during the holiday, including the annual prayer-giving at the city's Guiyan Temple — which attracted 700,000 tourists during last year's holiday. \n Tour groups heading out of the city have also been cancelled. \n Hong Kong and British scientists have estimated that between 1,300 and 1,700 people in Wuhan may have been infected.

Governments are stepping up surveillance of airline passengers from central China and taking other steps to try to control the outbreak.\nHere's what you should know about the illness:\nWHAT IS THE NEW VIRUS?\nScientists have identified it as a new coronavirus. The name comes from the Latin word for crowns or halos, which coronaviruses resemble under a microscope.\nThe coronavirus family has many types that affect people. Some cause the common cold while others originating in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses such as SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome - or MERS - Middle East respiratory syndrome.\nWHERE DID IT COME FROM?\nThe first cases appeared last month in Wuhan, a city in central China's Hubei province. Many of the first people infected had visited or worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has since been closed for an investigation.\nChinese health officials say they believe the illness first spread from animals to people. They now say it can spread between people.\nHOW WIDESPREAD IS IT?\nChina has identified 440 cases and nine deaths, most of the illnesses and all of the deaths in Hubei province. Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, the US and Taiwan.\nThe outbreak coincides with China's busiest travel season as people visit their families or go abroad for the Lunar New Year holiday. That travel rush is expected to spread the disease more widely.\nWHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?\nCommon symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous kinds of coronavirus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In serious cases, the virus can cause pneumonia\n.\nHOW IS IT TREATED?\nThere is a test to identify the virus, but no vaccine to prevent an infection. Patients with the virus have been isolated in hospitals or homes to prevent spreading it.\nThe symptoms are treated with pain and fever medication, and people are advised to drink plenty of liquids and rest while they recover.\nHOW IS IT SPREADING?\nMany coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Scientists believe the new virus can spread from person-to-person in close contact through the respiratory tract.\nCOULD IT BE AS BAD AS SARS?\nSo far, the virus appears less dangerous and infectious than SARS, which also started in China in 2002-03 and killed about 800 people. However, viruses can mutate into more dangerous and contagious forms, and it's too early to say what will happen with this one.\n",

The 68-year-old was detected with a high body temperature at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on Jan 19. He is being treated at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Disease Institute in Nonthaburi province. \n Anutin said both patients are receiving treatment at medical facilities outside the capital Bangkok. \n He added: “I’d like to ask the people to be confident in Thailand's medical system and public health, which is modern and ready to handle the situation, although the virus is a new strain. \n \"As of now, there is no report of human-to-human transmission in Thailand. We are monitoring and separating arriving passengers.

        "news_content_translate_en": "DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s government is on high alert to deal with a new flu-like coronavirus that has killed nine people in mainland China, the city’s commerce secretary, Edward Yau, said on Wednesday.\nThe outbreak has rattled financial markets as investors recall the huge impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.\nYau is part of a delegation on a mission to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos to convince global business and political leaders that the Asian financial hub is back on track after more than seven months of protests, even as it faces a potentially more damaging crisis.\n“The whole world is watching this new epidemic ... We are also getting fully prepared for this because of such close proximity between Hong Kong and the mainland, and very hectic travel,” Yau told Reuters.\nDuring the Lunar New Year celebrations, tens of millions of Chinese travel domestically, starting from this week.\n“Policy is on high alert, making sure that we can contain and prevent the spreading of the disease.”\nThe virus, originating in Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to Chinese cities including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.\nThere have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Hong Kong, although the Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed on Wednesday its first case of pneumonia linked to the coronavirus.\nYau also said the former British colony was well placed to address any cyclical and structural challenges, just days after Moody’s downgraded the financial hub, blaming the government for failing to deal with the sometimes violent protests.\nSpeaking about the city’s “one country, two systems” formula of governance, Yau said Hong Kong was holding on “steadfastly” to the system\n.\nBritain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy under the “one country, two systems” formula, including a free press and independent judiciary.\nMany protesters believe Beijing has been steadily encroaching on that promised autonomy, something that China denies.\n",

I don't want Chinese tourists to enter.\" \n The incoherently worded, grammatically incorrect sign written in Chinese with the heading \"No Chinese allowed in the shop\" was displayed on the storefront and bore offensive words like \"absurd ethnic group\" and \"makes one feel annoyed\". \n The sign appears to also urge the Chinese not to go to Hakone and the rest of Japan in view of the virus outbreak. \n The store owner said the sign was written with the help of a translation app and told reporters he will rewrite it to avoid using expressions that may generate controversy. The ban, however, will stay. \n On the Chinese Twitter-like platform Weibo, netizens are calling for a boycott of the store. \n \"Although the translated text doesn't make sense, one can feel the strong malice,\" said one Weibo user Dong Dong Dong Ying Jiang who also posted a photo of the shop. \"Remember this trash shop and never go there.\" \n Some users however also pointed out that some shops in China also carry signs that say no entry for the Japanese and dogs\n. \n The 2019-nCoV virus emerged in central China's city of Wuhan in December last year and has since infected over 400 people and killed nine in mainland China alone, according to official figures released on Wednesday morning (Jan 22).

The total number of infected in that region alone is already greater than 440, while total patients throughout Chinese territory have risen to 547, officials announced. With this new data, the total number of cases detected worldwide increased to 55.\nIn Wuhan, a metropolis of nine million inhabitants, an unprecedented order was given to stop the contagion: no one leaves the city and public transport services are suspended. The airport departure terminal has been shut down and long-distance trains will follow if they make stops in the city.\nThe measures reflect the nervousness of the Beijing authorities, at a time when the largest annual migration on the planet is taking place: the Chinese Lunar New Year festivities, which move around the country hundreds of millions of people taking the opportunity to visit family and friends, As with Christmas in Western countries. According to the Chinese Ministry of Transport, the country must register a total of three billion domestic journeys over the next forty days. This is even the worst time of year to deal with a virus in China.\nThe figures released this Wednesday still harbour fears about a possible pandemic similar to that of atypical pneumonia, or Severe Acute Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which between 2002 and 2003 killed 650 people in mainland China and Hong Kong.\nFaced with this scenario, the Chinese National Health Commission announced further measures to contain the disease, including disinfection of ventilation systems at airports, stations and shopping centres across the country.\nYeah. \"If necessary, temperature controls will also be carried out in key areas and busy locations,\" said the reporting state body.\nThe total number of Chinese provinces with recorded cases of the new coronavirus is now 24, to which Hong Kong and Macao join. In the last ancient Portuguese territory, the authorities confirmed the case of a 52-year-old merchant woman from the Chinese city of Wuhan who arrived in Macao on the 19th day and who was subjected to two tests confirming the disease. Currently committed in isolation at the Count of Saint January Hospitality Centre, is considered a high-risk patient.\nHowever, the Macanese authorities stress that there is no outbreak in the territory at the moment. But there are preventive measures in place: daily visits to hospitals will be reduced from two periods to one and public spaces are being cleaned up, cases of bus stops and taxis and municipal markets.\nIn Hong Kong, the case of a 39-year-old man who had visited Wuhan is confirmed and, according to Hong Kong Health Secretary Sophia Chan, he is \"highly suspected\" of contracting the virus. The authorities have also set up an emergency telephone line to meet people who have been on the same train as the possible patient who has already travelled in Hong Kong territory.\nOutside China, cases of the new coronavirus have also been confirmed in South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan and the United States. All the patients were in Wuhan. Several countries with direct or indirect air links to Wuhan are therefore systematically carrying out checks on passengers from areas considered to be at risk.\nYeah.\nThe Portuguese Government, for its part, warned on Wednesday that citizens travel to China and surrounding areas to learn about the evolution of the virus and recommended that tourists and residents register with or register at the consulate, according to the Lusa Agency.\n\"Travellers, in particular those travelling to China and neighbouring regions, are recommended to be duly informed of developments and to remain vigilant with regard to reports published on the portals of the Directorate-General for Health, from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organisation\", it warns the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the portal of Portuguese communities.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIn Brazil, authorities are investigating a suspicious case in Minas Gerais, advancing the Globo news portal G1. According to a note released by the State Department of Mining Health, the possible patient, a 35-year-old Brazilian woman, has returned from Shanghai to 18th January. While ensuring that she was not in the Wuhan region, the woman had respiratory symptoms compatible with the disease and was transported to the Menezes State Hospital in Belo Horizonte, where she is under observation and waiting for tests to validate or rule out infection with the new coronavirus.\nW\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Deaths from China’s new flu-like virus rose to 17 on Wednesday, with more than 540 cases confirmed, leading the city at the center of the outbreak to close transportation networks and urge citizens not to leave as fears rose of the contagion spreading.\nThe previously unknown coronavirus strain is believed to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central city of Wuhan. Cases have been detected as far away as the United States.\nContrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people, China’s communist government has this time given regular updates to try to avoid panic as millions travel for the Lunar New Year.\nAfter a meeting at its Geneva headquarters on Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it would decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which would step up the international response.\nIf it does so, it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade.\n“This is an evolving and complex situation,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nAs it seeks to stop the spread of the virus, Wuhan’s local government said it would close all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from the city as of 10 a.m. on Thursday (0200 GMT), state media reported, adding that the government said citizens should not leave the city unless there were special circumstances.\nThe measure was intended to “effectively cut off the transmission of the virus, resolutely curb the spread of the epidemic, and ensure the health and safety of the people,” state media cited Wuhan’s virus task-force as saying.\nWuhan’s move was praised by Ghebreyesus as a “very strong” measure that could minimize the risk of contagion\n.\n“If Wuhan is taking such drastic measures, we must assume widespread community transmission in this central China megacity & transport hub,” Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington, wrote in a tweet.\nWith more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China’s main industrial and commercial center, home to the country’s largest inland port and gateway to its Three Gorges hydroelectric dam.\nThe latest death toll in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, rose to 17 by midday on Wednesday, state television quoted the provincial government as saying.\nHowever, the virus has already spread beyond the city to population centers including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong.\nThe official China Daily newspaper said 544 cases had now been confirmed in the country. Thailand has confirmed four cases, while the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have each reported one.\nBritain advised its citizens against all but essential travel to Wuhan.\nMany Chinese were canceling trips, buying face masks, avoiding public places such as cinemas and shopping centers, and even turning to an online plague simulation game as a way to cope.\n“The best way to conquer fear is to confront fear,” said one commentator on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.\nChina’s National Health Commission Vice Minister Li Bin said the virus, which can cause pneumonia and has no effective vaccine, was being spread via breathing. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.\n“I feel fearful, because there’s no cure for the virus,” said Fu Ning, a 36-year-old woman in Beijing. “You have to rely on your immunity if you get an infection. It sounds very scary.”\nThe WHO’s head of emergencies program, Mike Ryan, said the priority was to find the roots of how the virus was passing between people\n.\nFears of a pandemic initially spooked markets but they regained their footing on Wednesday, with investors citing the robust response from authorities as reassuring.\nBut companies with operations in China, from Foxconn (2317.TW) to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L), warned staff to avoid Wuhan and handed out masks.\nThe European Center for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said in a risk assessment that further global spread of the virus was likely. “The likelihood of case importation is highest in countries with the greatest volume of people traveling to and from Wuhan,” the ECDC’s director Andrea Ammon said in a statement.\nAirports globally stepped up screening from China.\nRussia strengthened its sanitary and quarantine controls, and Singapore and Saudi Arabia started screening all passengers from China.\nThe Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed its first case of pneumonia linked to the coronavirus and tightened body-temperature screening measures.\nA first case emerged in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, media reported, with the patient arriving via high-speed railway from the mainland, and Mexico was investigating a potential case.\nNorth Korea banned foreign tourists, several foreign tour operators said.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The emergence of a new virus in central China has brought back painful memories of another virulent respiratory disease that wreaked worldwide havoc and left the country’s health authorities struggling to rebuild public trust.\nBut global health experts said China has come a long way since 2003, when it was accused of trying to cover up a major outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a previously unknown virus believed to have emerged from the wet markets of Guangdong province before spreading into major cities. As many as 774 people died in an epidemic that reached nearly 30 countries.\nNow, nearly 17 years later, government officials insist they have learned from past mistakes as they try to contain the latest deadly viral pneumonia strain, which has infected 440 people, mostly in Wuhan city, and killed nine since it was first identified at the end of last month.\nLiu Heng, an adviser to China’s cabinet said it took the country about four or five months to announce the SARS outbreak to the public, and this time it had taken less than a month.\n“We are doing much better now... We are paying greater attention to preventing the epidemic,” he told reporters.\nLi Bin, vice minister at the National Health Commission, told reporters on Wednesday that since 2003, China had established comprehensive new procedures to handle major health threats.\n“With relatively complete prevention and control systems for sudden and infectious diseases in place since SARS ... and with the support of the broad masses of the public, we are confident of victory,” he said.\nA key factor watched by experts both at home and overseas has been the rapid disclosure of information about the genetic structure of the virus and the way it has spread through the population\n.\nLi said Beijing had learned from its experiences with SARS and was now sharing all relevant data with international stakeholders, including the World Health Organization (WHO).\n“The speed with which this virus has been identified is testament to changes in public health in China since SARS and strong global coordination through the WHO,” said Jeremy Farrar, a British infectious diseases specialist who also worked on combating SARS.\nExperts say the failures of SARS were caused by an under-resourced and overcentralised health system with little experience of infectious diseases and no information disclosure mechanisms. Local governments were also reluctant to take responsibility for the rapid spread of infections.\nBeijing has since established the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention that hooks up hospitals and clinics nationwide and reports outbreaks in real time. It has also set up specific mechanisms for new pneumonia strains.\n“China... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since SARS, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,” said Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at the Kirby Institute in Sydney.\nVice-minister Li said China’s health infrastructure was also now better able to cope, with the country ready to deploy several “back-up” hospitals that could be put into action should the number of infected people spike further.\nThe silence on the part of authorities during the early stages of SARS helped create a rumor mill that sparked panic in several major cities and brought the economy to a standstill. One estimate suggested China’s economy slowed by around 1-2 percentage points in 2003 as a result of SARS.\nThis time, officials have been warned they face public ignominy if they cover up any infections, and the message throughout state media has been about the need for greater transparency\n. Communist Party-backed tabloid Global Times said on Wednesday that “concealment would be a serious blow to the government’s credibility and might trigger greater social panic”.\nPresident Xi Jinping has vowed to curb the spread of the virus, which has erupted just before the nation begins its biggest holiday this week, the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions people travel.\nNevertheless, some people said Chinese officials are cracking down on those who spread news about the disease online.\nSocial media is still awash with cover-up claims, and some doubts are still being expressed about the accuracy and timeliness of China’s data.\n“We can only judge the information we are being provided and have no way to determine if any information is not being disclosed,” said MacIntyre.\nAnd the big test of lessons learned could be still to come, when new year travel could create countless new vectors for the potential transmission of the virus.\nAdam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney, said China has “come a long way” since the outbreak of SARS.\n“I’m not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations,” he said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "上海（路透社）-一种新病毒在中国中部地区的出现，让人们回想起另一种致命的呼吸道疾病的痛苦记忆，这种疾病在世界范围内造成了严重破坏，使中国卫生当局难以重建公众的信任。\n但全球卫生专家表示，自2003年中国被指试图掩盖严重急性呼吸系统综合征（SARS）的大规模爆发以来，中国已经取得了长足的进步。据信，SARS是一种此前未知的病毒，在蔓延到主要城市之前，从广东省的潮湿市场中出现。多达774人死于一场波及近30个国家的流行病。\n近17年后的今天，政府官员坚称，他们从过去的错误中吸取了教训，因为他们试图控制最新的致命病毒性肺炎菌株，该菌株已感染440人，其中大部分在武汉市，自上月底首次被确认以来，已造成9人死亡。\n中国内阁顾问刘恒说，中国花了四五个月的时间才向公众宣布非典疫情，而这次只花了不到一个月的时间。\n“我们现在好多了。。。我们正在更加注意预防这种流行病，”他告诉记者。\n国家卫生委员会副部长李斌周三告诉记者，自2003年以来，中国已经建立了全面的新程序来处理重大健康威胁。\n“非典以来，突发性传染病防控体系比较完善。。。在广大人民群众的支持下，我们有信心取得胜利。”。\n国内外专家关注的一个关键因素是，病毒基因结构和在人群中传播方式的信息迅速公开\n.\n李克强说，北京从非典的经验中吸取了教训，目前正在与包括世界卫生组织（世卫组织）在内的国际利益攸关方分享所有相关数据。\n同时致力于抗击非典的英国传染病专家杰里米·法拉尔说：“这种病毒被发现的速度证明了自非典以来中国公共卫生的变化以及通过世卫组织进行的强有力的全球协调。”。\n专家说，SARS的失败是由于缺乏资源和过度集中的卫生系统造成的，该系统对传染病缺乏经验，也没有信息披露机制。地方政府也不愿为传染病的迅速蔓延承担责任。\n此后，北京建立了中国疾病预防控制信息系统，将全国的医院和诊所连接起来，并实时报告疫情。它还为新的肺炎菌株建立了特定的机制。\n“中国。。。悉尼Kirby研究所生物安全研究项目负责人Raina MacIntyre说：“自非典以来，我们已经开发了出色的疾病监测系统，包括对严重急性呼吸道感染的实时紧急部门监测，因此这将有助于快速识别新病例。”。\n李克强副部长说，中国的卫生基础设施现在也有了更好的应对能力，中国准备部署几家“后备”医院，如果感染人数进一步激增，这些医院可以投入行动。\n在非典的早期，当局的沉默帮助制造了一个谣言工厂，在几个主要城市引发恐慌，并使经济陷入停滞。一项估计显示，2003年由于非典，中国经济放缓了1-2个百分点。\n这一次，官员们被警告说，如果他们掩盖了任何感染，他们将面临公众的耻辱，整个国家媒体都在传递这样一个信息：需要提高透明度\n. 中共支持的小报《环球时报》周三表示，“隐瞒真相将严重打击政府的公信力，可能引发更大的社会恐慌”。\n习近平总统誓言要遏制病毒的传播，该病毒是在本周开始的最大节日，即农历新年，几亿人旅行的时候爆发的。\n尽管如此，一些人说，中国官员正在打击那些在网上传播疾病消息的人。\n社交媒体仍然充斥着掩盖真相的说法，人们仍对中国数据的准确性和及时性表示怀疑。\n麦金太尔说：“我们只能判断所提供的信息，无法确定是否有任何信息没有被披露。”。\n而经验教训的重大考验可能还在后头，届时新年旅行可能会为病毒的潜在传播创造无数新载体。\n悉尼大学国际安全研究中心（Centre for International Security Studies）传染病专家亚当•卡姆拉特•斯科特（Adam Kamradt Scott）表示，自非典爆发以来，中国“走过了漫长的道路”。\n他说：“我不确定在疫情爆发的现阶段，我们是否能期待更多的疫情爆发，特别是当他们集中精力应对疫情并试图在中国农历新年庆祝活动之前遏制疫情爆发时，这是可以理解的。”。\n",

A man in his 30s who traveled to the Chinese region was diagnosed with the virus last week in Seattle, in the State of Washington, confirmed Tuesday the Center for Disease Control (CDC), while nationwide I was glued to the television to follow the impeachment against Donald Trump in the Senate.\nWuhan virus is a new coronavirus called 2019-nCov transmitted between humans and causes respiratory diseases. It was first detected less than a month. From this city, located in the central part of the Chinese territory and where 11 million people live -more than London or New York, the disease began to spread to neighboring provinces. Last Friday, for example, there was no positive out there, but now there are 38 cases spread across 15 other major cities Chinese and jumped to four countries in Southeast Asia.\nPatient Seattle, which is currently unknown identity, is admitted to the Regional Medical Center Everett, the capital of Snohomish County (Washington). It is stable, responding to treatment and is not considered a risk. The CDC has also explained that the patient had no symptoms when he landed on January 15 in the US. He went to the doctor last Sunday and was hospitalized for pneumonia.\nThe patient did not visit any of the markets of Wuhan, where numerous cases of people affected by the virus were confirmed, but it was in the region, as explained to the press Nancy Messonnier, director of the department of respiratory diseases the CDC. Authorities are looking for all the people who have been in contact with the patient these days, Messonnier said. They do not expect more cases.\nSince last Friday 17, the CDC had imposed special controls to monitor the possible entry of the virus to the country's busiest airports on the West Coast, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and New York. They are the three airports with more passengers from the region of Wuhan. The CDC has allocated about 100 workers at these airports and quarantine rooms installed. Health authorities were alert for two weeks. On January 11 they had issued a health warning Level 1 passenger who had been in Wuhan.\nA group of experts from the Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong suggests that reality is even more worrying that the data offered by China. According to his report prepared in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and presented Tuesday, the total number of infected may already touching 1,500: 1,343 in Wuhan and 115 in the rest of the country.\nIn addition to China and the US, there have been cases of people with the virus detected in South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Taiwan, where a 55 year old woman has also been recognized Tuesday with the disease. As in previous cases, he traveled to Wuhan in recent weeks. Minister of Health of the island, Chen Shih-chung, insured has none of the relatives of the patient presents symptoms any, similar to those of an ordinary pneumonia, and 46 others who were in contact with her during the journey aircraft have been placed under observation. In addition, the Philippines and Australia have also announced to have taken action at the first suspected cases in its territory.\nWHO he conducted Monday a visit to Wuhan with a group of Chinese health experts, led by Dr. Zhong Nanshan, director of the State Laboratory of Infectious Diseases in Canton and national eminence in the field. According to experts conglomerate, 15 medical workers in the city have contracted the virus, confirming the spread between humans end -a ruled until the end of past- week.\nThe escalation of this new coronavirus, discovered two weeks ago, reminiscent of the SARS epidemic, which has similarities with genetic. The epidemic of 2002, also originated in China, it has killed 700 people worldwide. WHO held tomorrow Wednesday an emergency meeting to decide whether to declare a \"public health emergency of international\" because of the outbreak. The Chinese State Council, meanwhile, has also scheduled a press conference in which he detailed the evolution of the virus in the last hours.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (AFP) - The food market where China's deadly virus surfaced was a smorgasbord of exotic wildlife ranging from wolf pups to species linked to previous pandemics such as civets, according to vendor information and a Chinese media report. \n The Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan came under greater scrutiny on Wednesday (Jan 22) as Chinese officials said that the virus which has so far killed nine people and infected hundreds may have originated in a wild animal sold at the food emporium. \n Past deadly epidemics have been blamed on wild animals - severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was linked to Chinese consumption of civet meat - setting the Chinese authorities up for potential embarrassment if lax supervision of wildlife trafficking is found at fault in the latest outbreak. \n A price list circulating on China's Internet for a business at the Wuhan market lists a menagerie of animals or animal-based products, including live foxes, crocodiles, wolf puppies, giant salamanders, snakes, rats, peacocks, porcupines, camel meat and other game - 112 items in all. \n \"Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door,\" said the price list for the vendor, \"Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses\". \n Dr Gao Fu, director of the Chinese centre for disease control and prevention, said in Beijing on Wednesday that authorities believe the virus likely came from \"wild animals at the seafood market\" though the exact source remains undetermined. \n China bans the trafficking of a number of wild species or requires special licences, but regulations are loose for some species if they are commercially farmed. \n AFP was unable to directly confirm the authenticity of the price list. Phone calls to the vendor went unanswered, and attempts to connect to its social media accounts were rejected\n. \n The Beijing News published a photo on Tuesday showing the same vendor's now-shuttered store front, as authorities in white hazmat suits milled about. \n The paper also quoted other merchants as saying that trade in wildlife took place up until the market was shuttered for disinfection shortly after the outbreak. \n A number of the early sufferers of the virus, now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), were employees of the market. \n Many exotic species are still widely consumed in China or other Asian countries, where they are considered a delicacy - like the civet or some rats or bats - or for purported health benefits that are unproven by science. \n But this brings growing human health risks, said Dr Christian Walzer, executive director of the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society's Health Programme. \n Dr Walzer said 70 per cent of all new infectious diseases come from wildlife, with habitat encroachment increasing the chances of pathogens spreading. \n \"Wildlife markets offer a unique opportunity for viruses to spill over from wildlife hosts,\" he said. \n \"It is essential to invest resources not only into discovering new viruses, but more importantly, in determining the epidemiological drivers of... (the) spillover, amplification, and spread of infectious diseases.\" \n Bats are thought to have spawned Sars, which in 2002 to 2003 killed hundreds of people in Asia, mostly China. \n Sars was also found in civets in wildlife markets in China, with many scientists believing the bat virus infected the cat-like creatures and then humans who ate them. \n Following Sars, China cracked down on consumption of civets and some other species, but conservationists say the trade continues. \n China has so far won praise for its openness and handling of the current outbreak in stark contrast to Sars, when it was accused of stifling information and failing to cooperate with the rest of the world.\n",

The nCoV (acronym for \"new coronavirus\") was born thousands of kilometers of Latin America, a region remote: no city of the continent is among those that receive more visits from the Chinese provinces affected by a detailed study. And yet, Google searches on \"coronavirus\" have soared in recent days.\nIn all cases, the alarm is for a suspected case. Media and audience are (are) to hunt for the Latin American patient zero of the nCoV. We have already had several discards: one in the Tamaulipas border, another in Cali, another in northern Argentina, several in Brazil under study right now. Chances are that this case comes, sooner or later. Everything moves so fast that it is possible that when you read these lines already have among the owners of the newspaper. But what do you mean exactly? What it will mean for the region that have imported a respiratory virus still poorly understood?\nOur brain perceives better define the risks if dramatically. We need a character (the disease) and a drastic change in the course of events (daily routine) to alert ourselves. But rare disease sometimes behaves under this Hollywood script, however much we try hard to put it into the story. Take, for example, the influenza epidemic (swine) born in Mexico in April 2009. From week to week, the attention of the country (and the world) was overturned on four characters: H1N1. A sense of urgency was quickly caught, as if moved by electrical impulses, reflected for example in relevant Google searches. But the evolution of the epidemic was substantially more gradual.\nWhat's more: slowly, the scientific teams were distilling the real impact addition of the virus, imposing parallel containment measures and necessary response. In the end, it was a contagious disease, yes, and amazingly dangerous for younger (when flu tends to affect especially those over 65). But I did not mean catastrophe in mortality our minds wanted to dramatize: according to an estimate by the Center for Disease Control in the US, H1N1 killed about the same people as seasonal flu, staying below other pandemics last.\nOur brain, however, remains committed to find dramas and is in the seemingly cold numbers. One of these figures, which has captured the attention of the audience on social networks on the nCoV, is known as R0: the average people who become infected from another already infected with a disease. We had just a few weeks when several epidemiologists epidemic drew their estimates. Some clung to the highest figures, once again sounding the alarm messages from the \"contagious coronavirus each affected by three people\" style. But the truth is that these estimates were considerably variables. They always are: even with well-known diseases, the value of the R0 varies greatly according to the study.\nIt's just normal; to the end and Cape, a disease can behave very differently depending on the social context in which it develops. Not be the same a viral outbreak in a place without hygienic conditions and high population density, which in a sparsely populated rural area. That is why even the most contagious diseases, such as measles, offer wide ranges greatly contagion. Also, do not forget that averages can be misleading: if it turns out that the value of contagion from the nCoV in China is 2, this figure is so compatible with the idea of ​​a thousand infected transmitting the virus to two people each, as the extreme scenario ten \"super-contagiadores\" affecting fifty people each one (because their work puts them in contact with many people, because there was still no insulation, or for other reasons) and other ninety-nine that contaminates less than one person per capita. While the first scenario would ensure an exponential spread in the second control of the virus it would be much easier once one identifies the conditions that favor the massive transmission. Between these two extremes there is a whole world of possibilities we do not know, and that will determine when and how will the nCoV Latin America.\nActually, what these numbers tell us is that uncertainty is an unavoidable aspect when we speak of epidemics. The drama is in fact a way to reduce it: if we have a clearly identifiable enemy, fear becomes certainty. But this same bias is what makes us belittle or ignore those risks to which we have become accustomed. Even when they are suffering a worrying rise.\nLet's talk, for example, the mentioned measles. In 2016 there were fewer than a hundred cases in the Americas. Two years later the figure had increased one hundred sixty: 16,000, recorded by WHO, mostly located in Brazil. Sao Paulo in 2019 recorded the first death from the disease in two decades. The lack of coverage of full and effective vaccination was the main cause.\nMalaria infected by mosquitoes in tropical areas, is otherwise return an adversary who never left the whole. But here the weight of the upturn corresponds to Venezuela, which captured more than half of the total cases in 2017.\nInterestingly, although both diseases have disproportionately drawn attention in the respective countries during the last half of 2019, both in Brazil and Venezuela look (measured by Google searches) turned quickly to the coronavirus in early 2020, confirming that nothing beats a good, new story of fear and uncertainty.\nThus, although follow our attention different logics, while certain diseases are greatly diminished or almost disappeared in the region (cholera is a good example of success), others remain with similar figures (tuberculosis: about 280,000 cases throughout the American continent year after year throughout the XXI century), as referenced above, even recover lost ground. When looking for causes, no simple answers. The mosquito-borne diseases are a good example. Several Venezuelan doctors on the ground have complained about the lack of fumigations led by the state that once served to decimate malaria. But spraying is not everything: as asked in its editorial of March 2016 the Journal of the National Institute of Health of Colombia, of the Zika (another virus infected bites) in Colombia and Brazil, do you really how cash is fumigated in places that do not meet sanitation (water, garbage collection) minimum? The director of the Institute for Health and Environment at the University of El Bosque, Victor Olano, pointing at a later issue of the same publication the need to ensure these minimum coverage in rural areas as a first line of fire against another disease still present on the continent : yellow fever.\nA similar reflection we can make in your day with nCoV: although it is likely that all the media attention focuses on the design of new drugs, measures basic control proliferation (early identification of cases with corresponding insulation) and maintenance healthy immune systems are the most effective strategies, but less spectacular. Similarly, the best way to prevent such epidemics flourish is to implement hygiene protocols in the treatment of animals by humans, something that the public authorities also have much to say and do.\nThe war against epidemics is not ultimately a matter of a single dramatic battle for the fate of mankind. It is neither the nCoV, as it was not the H1N1 (which, although diminished, still with us).\nThe moral is that, as the disseminator Swedish doctor Hans Rosling said, we must tame our thirst for drama and refocusing attention, effort, dedication to what can actually have a positive impact. In the case of infectious diseases, vaccines, protocols and sanitation infrastructure, research and response mechanisms exist internationally are our best allies. While the first two points are what will help us fight diseases already known, research and supra-state capabilities are particularly crucial when we are facing a new disease. Recognizing this, the World Health Organization agreed international regulatory framework of reference in 2005 to ensure commitment to common standards in the region and throughout the world. Every year, the WHO itself measures the degree of implementation of regulations in each country.\nAlthough there are obvious differences in the region it is considerable agreement. There are some worrying points in regard to preparation, and some countries are conspicuously behind the rest. It is also important to note that these WHO figures do not measure the quality or the actual state of health systems in the field. Something that, for example, Venezuela would score well below the rest given the damage to its facilities with the crisis of recent years. All these data indicate that, on paper, the continent has many of the tools of governance needed to face a new epidemic. Now, to know what their exact translation into reality can only hope.",

Two weeks of isolation will only be preventive, since they have no symptoms, as noted by Bethlehem Padilla, assistant doctor of the Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the Gregorio Maranon hospital and vice president of the Medical Association of Madrid: \"There are sick. They are people who have been in an area with coronavirus, but have no symptoms. Quarantine is to monitor only \".\nAlso emphasizes that the Health Minister Enrique Ruiz Escudero: \"There are considered and patients. They were in the region and are therefore potential candidates, but nothing more. Are asymptomatic and, if they had any symptoms, had been unable to travel. \"He explains to the phone when they arrive in Madrid will be another test and then go to\" normal to pass that preventive quarantine hospital. \"\nWhile the trip was being prepared, a few hours ago, the Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the international emergency outbreak to launch a \"global action\" to contain the advance of the virus and, community, the Ministry of Health established a protocol sent to all hospitals in the region to handle, if any, to patients suspected of infection with this virus. The alarm landing the plane can generate citizenship is normal -for the novelty of the virus- but lacking arguments. Dr. Padilla explains why.\nIs there a risk of contagion in Madrid?\nThe risk is now none, because there is no case in Spain. Although it seems a very transmissible virus [it has had a rapid spread], can only happen if you have traveled to that particular area of ​​China or had contact with people who have done it. But today the risk is zero.\nIs it advisable to take precautions?\nCurrently we do not have to do anything other than be aware of new information that gives the Ministry of Health and follow their recommendations as well as those published by the Community of Madrid. No need to go to pharmacies for masks or we use alcohol hand sanitizer for all and everywhere. We must take the same precautions apply with influenza or other viruses that visit us every year, for example, never coughing into hands, but in a handkerchief and then discarded or elbow.\nHow Madrid is ready to meet the arrival of evacuated citizens?\nTranquility has to be high, public health in Spain and Madrid is excellent, with excellent services microbiology and large hospitals that offer services where you can do the test for the virus if necessary, though, for now who has officially confirmed any suspicions is the National Microbiology Center (CNM) in Majadahonda.\nWhat if a case appeared in the Community?\nAlso tranquility would have to be absolute. We have two hospitals with isolation units, La Paz-Carlos III and Gómez Ulla military hospital, where patients could be. So far this untreatable virus, nor have many other viruses, and what they need are good supportive care. Oxygen in case of pneumonia, for example, or good intensive care services. Hospitals are putting up multidisciplinary teams to adopt the measures of the protocol of the Community of Madrid, formed by emergency physicians, preventive, microbiology, infectious and medical UVI.\nThe protocol to which Dr. Padilla refers establishes guidelines for handling possible cases when symptoms give the Ministry of Health has collected into a document. \"The most common include cough, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, a major difficulty breathing, kidney failure and even death. The most serious cases usually occur in elderly or suffering from some other disease such as of the heart, lung or immune problems. \" Although not yet known precisely how the infection occurs, the most accepted form is through contact and by droplets expelled to coughing.\nThe document states that \"in the first contact with patients who come to hospital emergency\" is necessary to ask if you have traveled to the province of Hubei in China, in the 14 days before the onset of symptoms or has been in contact with a probable or confirmed case of 2019-nCoV. If affirmative answer was, start the first part of the protocol, which involves the placement of surgical mask for both patient and staff to accompany him and isolation in a single habituation to the corresponding tests.\nIf the suspicion is confirmed, it would be reported immediately to Public Health and the necessary samples be extracted to send to the National Center for Microbiology (which should communicate the results in less than 24 hours), while the patient would have to remain in isolation to get the results.\nAnd \"if the clinical condition of the patient has severity criteria before knowing the diagnosis pending the result of the laboratory of the CNM, prior authorization for public health, may be transferred the patient to the referral hospital: Hospital La Paz-Carlos III\" says the document of the Ministry. In that case, \"Public Health who will perform communication to the Hospital La Paz-Carlos III and contact Summa 112 to transport the patient.\"\nThe Minister of Health believes it is essential to give information and give it responsibly: \"We must be expectantly, yes, but calm. And raise awareness of what is reality. Now, today, the population is not at risk \". If you ever happen, the region, claims the director, \"is absolutely ready\". Explains that this Thursday was updated with the latest information and with the Ministry of Health, the protocol for primary and hospital care and the management of patients suspected: \"Both epidemiological part as healthcare, is all scheduled and defined. Itineraries, processes patients, staff ... \".\nAs more becomes known to the experts whose mortality virus priced between 2% and 3%, compared with similar low virus, according to the data hitherto available-protocol will change if necessary. Guarding that information there, in Madrid, a specific committee as the Minister has already met three times and comprises the whole spectrum of specialists required by the situation, \"in perfect coordination\" with the Ministry. \"In any case, if a case occurs, Madrid has the care dimension list for what may come.

He and five other German citizens who were negative in tests remain in quarantine at the Our Lady Hospital Guadalupe Island of La Gomera for possible contain contagions, as reported Saturday morning Fernando Simon, director of the Coordinating Center Health emergencies.\nSimon has given some details of the case following a ministerial meeting evaluation and monitoring of the coronavirus, which was held at the Ministry of Health. Right now there is no other case study. The patient contracted the disease confirmed in Germany, after a \"very direct\" contact with an employee which had transmitted a female colleague who came from China. At the time of infection, this had some symptoms (although still had not tested positive), so the hypothesis that the disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients is increasingly losing weight, according to Simon.\nGerman tourists who are now in quarantine arrived in Spain on 28 night from Munich. At the next day, to notify the German authorities the positive in the case of the employee and have the record that those who had traveled to Spain had maintained contact with him, it was decided, in principle, a home insulation in the municipality of Hermigua. After doing tests, five of them were negative, but remain quarantined and under observation. The other was positive, so their situation is confinement in a hospital room, although on no symptoms, does not require any special care. This is a precautionary measure.\nHealth authorities are now looking for contacts to track if they appear symptoms of the disease. Two people who will track them be who traveled to her on the plane. Canary President Victor Angel Torres, reported Saturday that tourists came to Tenerife and, hence, went to La Gomera by boat, reports Pedro Murillo. The victim made the trip, an hour, to the side of a window, which \"minimizes the risks.\" \"There is an accurate description since he left Germany\" has assured the head of the Epidemiology service Canaries Domingo Nunez. \"On the boat he did not move even to go to the bathroom;. There was no contact with other passengers There is no reason to think about contact risk.\" The port of San Sebastian de La Gomera were moved by rental car to Hermigua, one small town located 20 kilometers from the capital where many houses are located.\nHealth Minister, Salvador Illa, expressed his confidence in the NHS. \"The detection and warning systems are working. We have already warned that it was possible that some cases were detected in Spain\", he has assured after the meeting between the government responsible. Illa has announced that it will convene all health counselors of the autonomous communities in an extraordinary inter-territorial council early next week to study the situation and, if necessary, strengthen the prevention and detection of the virus week.\nMeanwhile, the Spanish quarantined arrived on Friday to the Gómez Ulla hospital in Madrid also in perfect condition, the ministry reported. The center is coordinating how will the regime of family visits. The twenty nationals who are on the 17th floor of the military hospital grounds do not require evidence first, since they are not \"risk cases\" in the words of Simon, \"simply they remain in quarantine\" that China had already imposed in Wuhan.\nWuhan coronavirus has already left 304 dead and affected more than 14,000 worldwide. Of these, 151 are in 23 countries other than China. The rapid ascent of the number of cases-just over a month has exceeded the number of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, for its acronym in English), history more similar- and the first contagions outside China-and there have been not imported into Germany, the UK, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the international health emergency on Thursday. This measure allows the body to coordinate actions and make recommendations to countries, but so far have not substantially changed compared to before the global alarm.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The world is in the midst of emergency caused by pneumonia. And no, I not just talk about the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China. While public health authorities are struggling to contain the dangerous viral agent of SARS -nCoV2019 type, as is known-, childhood pneumonia is today the most infectious murderer of children, claiming a life every 39 seconds. Nevertheless, the international community has responded to this emergency with little more than a collective shrug.\nPerhaps this is because most people think that pneumonia is primarily a threat to the elderly, which is true. Coronavirus, which kills through severe acute respiratory infection and has reinforced this perception. Most of the victims were elderly with preexisting health conditions. However, pneumonia is today the leading cause of infectious death in children and claims more than 800,000 lives a year. Most victims are under the age of 2 years. Most deaths occur in the poorest countries of the world.\nThere are no statistics that can capture the human tragedy that is at the center of the emergency. Caused by bacteria, fungi or viral agents this is a disease that attacks the air sacs of the lungs, causing it to swell and fill with pus. Children are literally struggling to breathe.\nThe good news is that childhood pneumonia can be overcome. Effective pneumococcal vaccines (PCVs) can prevent non-viral cases and Gavi (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) has funded the vaccination of more than 120 million children. With early and accurate diagnosis by a health worker, most cases can be treated successfully with basic antibiotics that cost less than 45 cents. Even the most severe cases can be treated with antibiotics highest level and medical oxygen. In recent research conducted in hospitals in Nigeria has been found that a combination of medical oxygen and a diagnostic instrument called pulse oximeter, which measures oxygen levels in the blood, can reduce the death rate in half.\nNow the bad news. Although childhood pneumonia deaths are declining, more slowly than those of other great murderers such as malaria and measles. Five years ago, governments signed the commitment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of \"ending preventable child deaths\" by 2030. If current trends continue, pneumonia turn that promise into (another) promise unfulfilled, which it will further weaken the credibility, already fragile, governments, donors and international agencies comply with the ODS.\nSo why is the biggest murderer of children the world generates so little action and international cooperation? As I discussed in another space Devi Sridhar -Professor global public health at the University of Edinburgh-the victim profile it is part of the explanation.\nWith malnutrition as the main risk factor, pneumonia is the final illness of poverty. Those who face the greatest risks -the poor rural and slum dwellers urbanos- no voice in the priorities of the health agenda. And although the poorest children face the greatest risks are the least likely to be immunized, the last in the list of treatment and those most at risk of receiving an inaccurate diagnosis.\nPneumonia can check (in) equity health systems. When symptoms of the disease appear, the poorest households often delay treatment because of concerns about their cost, or because the nearest clinic is far away. In many cases, the clinics lack the trained personnel and diagnostic equipment they need to provide effective treatment.\nThere are some encouraging signs that suggest that inertia is giving way to action. This governments, donors, researchers, UN agencies and civil society organizations meet in Barcelona week in the first World Forum on Child Pneumonia. The goal is to share evidence and, more importantly, give impetus to control strategies pneumonia and action plans to turn that evidence into policies that save lives. They are emerging alliances for change, led by the Every Breath Counts Coalition (Every Breath account).\nOne of the barriers to effective action against pneumonia has been increasingly anachronistic debate between advocates of \"vertical\" or specific for the disease, and approaches \"horizontal\" aimed at strengthening health systems interventions. Substantive issues at stake are real. Too often, donors pronounced horizontal speech, emphasizing its commitment to strengthening health systems, but then loaded resources disease-specific interventions that distort health priorities. While the World Bank extols the virtues of strengthening health systems, their funds largely diverted resources into vertical interventions.\nIn the same way health systems must respond to diseases that endanger the poor. The idea that countries can move towards the holy grail of Universal Health Coverage without addressing diseases such as pneumonia, without breaking the link between malnutrition and broader health risks, is a fiction. The entry point for effective action is the primary health care and support for community health workers. Health systems that divert resources to higher-level facilities outside the reach of the poor, never become more than just a trickle effect.\nThe coronavirus has provided a painful but timely reminder that we are members of one human community. In our interconnected world, a health epidemic that starts in Wuhan can, in a few weeks, pose threats to health from Bombay to New York. Multilateralism and international cooperation are our only defense.\nBut the argument in favor of multilateral action does not stop with the epidemics that cross borders and affect the public in rich countries. Today, pneumonia kill more than 2,000 children. That is a health emergency, and is one that can stop.\nKevin Watkins is CEO of Save the Children UK.

        "news_content_translate_en": "While China intensified measures to control the spread of the coronavirus of Wuhan, which has killed 56 people and infected more than 2,000 in this country will know something more about the nature of the pathogen. The bad news: the ability to spread of the virus seems to get stronger, as pointed Health Minister Ma Xiaowei, so the number of people affected will continue to grow in time. The good news: so far no Chinese scientists have detected clear signs of mutation (although do not rule out in the future). And they have already begun to develop a vaccine.\nIn a crowded press conference in central Beijing, where the vast majority of journalists were covered with protective masks, the minister acknowledged that he knows about the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV is still very limited. Unlike the virus causing SARS, with which it is related, it can be spread during incubation period -of one to 14 days-during which the carrier still no symptoms. Another difference from that epidemic of 2003 that left nearly 800 dead worldwide: then the infection took three or four months to become epidemic. This only ever needed a month. \"Human beings adapt to the virus and get sick less. They also suit us, \"noted the director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Fu Gao, also present at the gathering.\nSo far, the virus has spread to 12 countries on four continents: the United States, Canada, France, Australia, Nepal, Korea South, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, totaling more than thirty cases. Tokyo said Sunday it had detected a new case, the fourth in its territory.\nSince the outbreak is not yet under control, China will continue to strengthen and adjust their control measures against the epidemic, the minister said, a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping, took the reins of the crisis and give orders spare no cost to resolve it. One key area will be the cancellation of mass events and limits on transport. The latter is especially important: after the holidays for the Lunar New Year is about to begin a wave of return trips, which can reach 400 million journeys and contribute to the spread of the virus.\nSo far, the Chinese government has chosen to enact a general extension of the holidays. For all, until Sunday 2 February. And for students, probably even more, although the exact dates back to the classroom at the time announced by the Ministry of Education, as indicated by state television CCTV.\nThe director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced Sunday that are traveling to Beijing to meet with Chinese officials and health experts. \"We want to explore the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China to provide more protection against the outbreak,\" he said in a Twitter message. After two days of meetings last Friday, WHO avoided international emergency decree by the virus. The agency considered it \"soon\" to implement the plan.\nMore victims at the epicenter\nThe autonomous government of Hong Kong has announced that from Monday, prohibits the entrance to the city of people from Hubei Province, whose capital Wuhan, is the picentro of the outbreak. The veto affects people originating in Hubei and those who have visited the area in the last 14 days, although the Government has clarified that the restriction is not for their fellow countrymen, Reuters reports.\nThe mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, acknowledged at a news conference he expects the number of affected increase by a thousand more in their city in the coming days. Authorities are awaiting the results of the nearly 3,000 suspected cases have been detected in the city, as recorded EP. The mayor has emphasized the pressure that are suffering the infrastructure to respond to the coronavirus and announced the construction of a specialized hospital to treat patients infected in this city of 11 million people.\nSeveral large municipalities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have already announced that schools be extended at least two weeks the school holidays. The capital and tourist cities such as Xi'an, or the whole province of Shandong, have suspended bus services long distance. To the extent possible, it is recommended to avoid displacement; transport companies return the cost of tickets without penalty. In railway stations, airports exchangers and temperature gauges and observation areas for possible suspected cases be installed.\nAdded to the quarantine blockades fifteen cities in Hubei, including Wuhan, the epicenter of the infection, these measures have reduced travel by 28.8% compared to previous seasons New Year, as revealed by Minister Transportation.\nIn addition to limiting the movement and close the area most affected part of efforts they will also engage in the treatment of those infected. Wuhan, where most patients are concentrated and has publicly acknowledged a shortage of protective medical supplies, will receive reinforcements of all kinds. It has already increased its hospital beds in 2300, and is expected in the coming days to have another 5,000 more. In the last 24 hours they have reached more than 2,000 healthcare professionals from the rest of the 30 Chinese provinces. Also they sent more than three million masks.\nOne of the big problems, he admitted the minister, it is the lack of protective suits. Wuhan each day, 11 million people need 10,000, and now, due to New Year holidays, the only factories are producing at 40% capacity. In order to complete the required number, it said Ma, will be used to reserves of the central government and the provinces, and will contact abroad to receive outside the quota missing.\nAuthorities are also trying to locate any resident of Wuhan who has left the city in the last two weeks. As he pointed out the mayor at his press conference, up to five million residents had left the city for the time quarantine, last Thursday at 10 am came into force. The wuhaneses who are outside should go to the nearest medical centers for a physical exam, and maintain a home quarantine for 14 days, as has urged Health Minister.\nThe governments of several countries have announced their intention to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan and other cities in quarantine. The United States plans to charter a plane on Tuesday to move back to its territory to 230 diplomats and other citizens. South Korea, Russia and France last -this, by bus to other cities have also indicated that they are in negotiations with the Chinese authorities for the release of their nationals. They were joined Sunday Japan, which has 700 compatriots in the area.",

Most patients who have died are above 60 and had pre-existing conditions, according to reports from local authorities.\nThe coronavirus can be passed between humans through close contact, Chinese medical experts say.\nThe novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak may reach its peak in one week or around 10 days, Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said.\n\"It is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be large-scale increases,\" Zhong told state-run Xinhua news agency.\nZhong is the head of a national team of experts set up for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering\n.\n\"There are two keys to tackling the epidemic: early detection and early isolation. They are the most primitive and most effective methods,\" he said.\nZhong said fever and weakness were the typical symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection found in the majority of patients.\nTen to 14 days is a sound period for isolation and observation. When the incubation period ends, those who fall sick will get timely treatment and those who do not will be just fine, he said.\nHe suggested that hospitals be staffed with not only infectious disease specialists, but also specialists in treating severe cases to better save patients.\nEpidemiologically, the novel coronavirus is homologous to the virus discovered in a type of bat in 2017, said Zhong, adding that the 2019-nCoV probably has an intermediate host that may be a certain kind of wild animal.\n\"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak lasted about six months, but I don't believe the novel coronavirus outbreak would last that long,\" said Zhong.\nThe country has taken a series of powerful measures, especially early detection and early isolation.\n\"We have sufficient confidence in preventing a major outbreak or a recurrence as long as the two measures are in place, although we still need to conduct much scientific research,\" he said.\nNoting that the key for Wuhan is how to reduce infections inside hospitals, Zhong said he supported the construction of makeshift hospitals in the city to control the infectious disease.\nThe activation of top-level public health emergency response was aimed at reducing the chance of infection, he said, adding that the vaccine development may need three to four months or even longer.\n\"Now scientists are speeding up research of neutralizing antibodies of the virus, but it takes time. With help from across the country, Wuhan, a heroic city, will pull through,\" Zhong said.\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called the coronavirus a \"demon\" which should be brought under control\n.\nChina has ramped up efforts to contain the virus. The country has extended the New Year Festival holidays till February 2 to prevent reverse migration of millions of migrants works to return to their work from holidays.\nUniversities, primary and middle schools and kindergartens across the country will postpone the opening of the spring semester until further notice.\nThe government is focussing efforts to prevent mass gatherings and mass travel to ensure the virus is not spread fast.\nBeijing has also launched temperature detection at 55 subway stations, including stops at railway stations and Beijing airport. Passengers with abnormal body temperatures will be sent to hospital.\n",

Ninety-three people are in isolation wards in various hospitals, according to the latest figures.\nKey players in the field have claimed that mass cancellations of hotel bookings and tour packages have already begun across the state.\nAfter the Kerala government declared the coronavirus outbreak as a 'state calamity', as the three positive cases were detected from Thrissur, Alapuzha and Kasaragod, tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran admitted that the sector had suffered a hit.\nThe sector had aggressively launched promotional advertisements in the domestic and international markets after the floods to revive the sector\n.\nHowever, all the efforts took a beating, with mass cancellations of hotel bookings after the outbreak of the infection in the state was reported.\nAccording to tourism department sources, during the 2019 calendar year it was projected that there would be an 18 per cent growth in the domestic and 8 per cent growth in foreign tourist arrivals.\nIn the first nine months of 2019 (January to September), domestic visitors to the southern state touched 16.48 per cent against 4.8 per cent in foreign tourist arrivals.\nThe peak season for foreign tourists is from November-February while for the domestic guests it is during April-May, August-September (Onam festival) and December-January.\nNoted travel and tourism entrepreneur E M Najeeb said tour programmes and packages are being cancelled widely from the state.\nDeclaration of the epidemic as a 'state calamity' by the government would adversely impact the economic situation in the state, he said.\n\"We completely appreciate the steps taken by the government to protect the infected persons, create awareness among the public and tackle the situation.\n“But, as far as tourism industry is concerned, such measures will scare the people. Not only tourism but all the business activities of the state will be affected,\" Najeeb, also senior vice president, Indian Association of Tour Operators, told PTI.\nWhile Najeeb said \"over-reaction\" would not augur well for the state, Jose Dominic, a key player in the hospitality industry, felt there are cancellations of hotel bookings but not as much as was being projected by the media.\nDominic said he personally felt that the state's reputation of having a robust healthcare system would help in such situations.\n\"We cannot say that there is no cancellation of hotel bookings. There are 15-20 per cent cancellations after the reporting of the coronavirus cases. But there are bookings also,\" he told PTI\n.\nThough people were worried about the development, the state generally has a reputation that the safest place to be in India, especially during the time of a health calamity, is Kerala, he said.\n\"We have a reputation that we will put travellers' health first before commercial interest,\" Dominic, CEO of Kochi-based CGH Earth, added.\nMeanwhile, a senior official of the state tourism department said the exact number of cancellations were not yet available, but he agreed that the repeated instances of flood and other epidemics were affecting the industry.\n\"As of now, the exact numbers are not available. But industry sources told us that many hotel bookings, including that of KTDC (Kerala Tourism Development Corporation) have been cancelled,\" he told PTI.\nThe help desks of Kerala Tourism at various centres were receiving several enquiries from people wanting to know the situation in the state, he said.\n\"As of now, the situation in Kerala is under control. There is no need to worry. But still people are worried and some have cancelled their bookings,\" the official said.\nHowever, Praveen Muraleedharan, who runs a couple of resorts in the state, said uncertainty was looming over the industry due to the virus scare.\n\"We are getting lots of cancellations. Many confirmed hotel bookings, events, conferences have got cancelled. The industry is extremely worried about the business. There is an uncertainty looming over the industry. We don't know from when we can start taking bookings,\" he said.\nMuraleedharan said the industry was also affected by the hartals or strikes even as the government had claimed that the protests will not affect the tourism sector.\n\"Earlier, hartals used to affect our industry. Even now, the situation is not different. Sabarimala protests, two consecutive floods and landslides in Wayanad, Nipah, anti-CAA protests and now this coronavirus.\n“All are directly affecting the tourism industry\n. Inflow of inbound tourist and the domestic tourism movement are affected,\" he said.\nAccording to T K Manzoor, managing director of the Bekal Resorts Development Corporation, despite the floods and Nipha, they had recorded a remarkable increase in tourist arrivals. There is 40 per cent growth in foreign tourist arrivals in 2019 (upto September) in North Kerala districts of Kasaragod and Kannur, he said.\n\"We hope to manage the present catastrophic situation due to the coronavirus. In the coming fiscal, Malabar Tourism is expected to record an uptrend though more efforts have to be put in,\" he said.\nKerala Tourism, which attracts international and domestic tourists, plays a significant role in the economy of the state by contributing over 10 per cent of the GSDP and providing employment to over 1.5 million people in the state.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Repeats story published earlier on Tuesday)\nBy Yawen Chen and Cate Cadell\nBEIJING, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n“My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don’t get any new answers,” Zhang told Reuters. “Every time the responses are the same: ‘There’s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what’s going on.’ The doctors are all very frustrated too.”\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travellers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan’s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters\n. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being “rumour spreaders.”\n“The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,” a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalised. “I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.”\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some “loopholes” in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognised that “all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.” But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n“In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I’m authorized,” he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested\n.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, “You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. “We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,” he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the centre for mathematical modelling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n“We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,” he told Reuters. “Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.”\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China’s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people\n.\n“The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus’s genome, building new hospitals at a moment’s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,” said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan’s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is “impossible to conduct the test right away,” an official at the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n“Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn’t be able to be treated,” the worker told Reuters. “The actual deaths were higher.”\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker’s account\n. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu’s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city’s health authorities.\n“All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,” said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. “At least if it’s confirmed we have a direction.

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Yang Zhongyi was still waiting on Monday for a coronavirus test in the Chinese city of Wuhan two weeks after she started to show signs of a fever, even though doctors privately told her family that she almost certainly has been infected, her son Zhang Changchun told Reuters.\nYang, 53, is just one of many Wuhan inhabitants finding it difficult to get tested or receive treatment for the new form of coronavirus, which authorities say has infected 2,800 people and killed at least 80 in China, a situation that may be contributing to the spread of the disease.\nYang has been unable to gain full-time admission to a hospital, her son said. She has been put on drips in unquarantined areas at four separate hospitals in the city to treat her deteriorating lungs, he said, while he is doing what he can to get her tested or admitted full-time.\n“My brother and I have been queuing at the hospital every day. We go at 6 and 7 in the morning, and queue for the whole day, but we don’t get any new answers,” Zhang told Reuters. “Every time the responses are the same: ‘There’s no bed, wait for the government to give a notice, and follow the news to see what’s going on.’ The doctors are all very frustrated too.”\nOfficially known as 2019-nCoV, the new form of coronavirus was first identified as the cause of death of a 61-year-old man in Wuhan on Jan. 10, when China shared gene information on the virus with other countries. Some, such as Japan and Thailand, started testing travelers from China for the virus within three days.\nHowever, testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan’s hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters\n. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.\nDuring that gap, hospitals in the city reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to just 82, according to data compiled by Reuters from Wuhan health authorities, and no new cases were reported inside China.\nDespite the lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan, Chinese authorities assured citizens in the days after the virus had been identified that it was not widely transmissible. In previous weeks, it had censored negative online commentary about the situation, and arrested eight people it accused of being “rumor spreaders.”\n“The doctor didn’t wear a mask, we didn’t know how to protect ourselves... no one told us anything,” a 45-year-old woman surnamed Chen told Reuters. Her aunt was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 20, five days after she was hospitalized. “I posted my aunt’s photos on (Chinese social media site) Weibo and the police called the hospital authorities. They told me to take it down.”\nNational, regional and city health officials did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters on how the virus outbreak has been handled. National officials did say at a media briefing last week that there were some “loopholes” in initial treatment methods.\nWuhan’s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, told Chinese state television on Monday he recognized that “all parties were not satisfied with the disclosure of our information.” But he pointed to strictures placed upon him by provincial and national leaders.\n“In local governance, after I receive information, I can only release it when I’m authorized,” he said. Zhou told a media briefing on Sunday that a further 1,000 people could be diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan, based on the number of patients yet to be tested\n.\nChina last week locked down the affected region in Hubei province in the biggest quarantine operation on record and is building two new hospitals to treat virus patients. President Xi Jinping has created a special committee to tackle the outbreak.\nThe country has been praised internationally for quickly sequencing the virus gene. However, its slow scale-up of testing has been questioned.\nOnce a virus has been identified, “You need to make sure you have all the reagent (a substance used in chemical analysis) samples and you’ve got it all pushed out to where you want to do testing,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, who focuses on emerging infectious disease and pandemic preparedness.\nAlthough information from the region is scarce, Adalja suggested China has had problems with this stage of tackling the outbreak. “We’re already hearing that there are shortages of medical professionals there, that there are shortages of test kits and medicines,” he said.\nJohn Edmunds, a professor at the center for mathematical modeling of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said China has not communicated enough detailed data after the initial outbreak.\n“We have a very incomplete picture of what’s going on,” he told Reuters. “Whether it’s incompetence, secrecy, or deliberate, I don’t know, but it would be very useful if we could have some basic epidemiological data.”\nThe shortage of testing supplies and China’s initial reticence have drawn criticism that the country is still learning lessons from the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 that killed almost 800 people\n.\n“The improvements have been on the hard science side - figuring out the virus’s genome, building new hospitals at a moment’s notice - more than on the soft science side of managing information and dealing with people,” said Mary Gallagher, a political science professor who leads the University of Michigan’s Center for Chinese Studies.\nCity managers had little incentive to escalate problems to political superiors. The week in which no new virus cases were reported in Hubei coincided with preparations for the Lunar New Year and sessions of the province’s National People’s Congress and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference.\nSeven of the largest hospitals in Wuhan are now equipped with testing kits for the virus, which in theory deliver results within a day, the Hubei CDC official said.\nBut four people told Reuters they were refused tests because the process involved a complex reporting system including hospital, district and city health authorities and disease control officials.\nTo qualify for the test, patients need to meet certain criteria, such as having symptoms of fever and pneumonia, and a surge in patients means it is “impossible to conduct the test right away,” an official at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters.\nThree hospital and local government workers, who have been briefed on how doctors are handling tests and confirming cases, told Reuters that official numbers of infections and deaths do not reflect the actual toll.\nWuhan health authorities have a limit on tests, chiefly because of the shortage of testing kits, and are screening lists of patients before deciding who gets a test, which takes several hours, one hospital worker told Reuters.\n“Some severely ill patients were left out from the final list for testing because they know they wouldn’t be able to be treated,” the worker told Reuters. “The actual deaths were higher.”\nReuters could not independently confirm the hospital worker’s account\n. Hubei and Wuhan health authorities did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nZhang, whose mother is still waiting for a test, said doctors at three Wuhan hospitals told her family privately that they are almost certain she has contracted the coronavirus.\nHowever, he said two of those hospitals told him they are not equipped with testing kits, and the other told him it has no available bed to accommodate his mother for the test.\nNone of those hospitals replied to Reuters requests for comment.\nSixty-nine year-old Xu Enen, who has had fever and a lung infection since Jan. 8, was rejected by six hospitals in Wuhan for testing as they said they had ran out of beds, his daughter told Reuters. Xu’s symptoms have worsened lately, and he is starting to have breathing difficulties.\nHe was finally admitted on Jan. 22 to queue for the test at Hankou hospital in Wuhan after his daughter publicized his case on Weibo.\nResearchers at Lancaster University estimate that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan have been identified. By Jan. 21, they estimated a total of 11,341 people had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. More than 30,000 people in Wuhan are under observation, according to the city’s health authorities.\n“All we want is to confirm the case is the virus or not,” said a 33-year-old Wuhan woman surnamed Liu, whose father has been on a respirator in hospital since Jan. 14 and was still untested on Monday. “At least if it’s confirmed we have a direction. If there’s no direction, there’s no hope.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two planes with about 300 passengers, mostly U.S. citizens, took off from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Thursday bound for the United States — the third group of evacuees from the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. State Department said.\nOne of the flights had room to accommodate more than 60 Canadians, who will disembark on a stopover in Vancouver, British Columbia, before the remaining passengers continue on to the United States, a State Department spokeswoman told Reuters.\nThe plane stopping in Vancouver will fly on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in Southern California, the Pentagon said in a separate statement.\nThe second aircraft is headed for Omaha, Nebraska, by way of Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, following a refueling stop in California, the Defense Department said. Both planes are due to arrive on Friday.\nThe Defense Department has set aside surplus housing at each of those and a handful of other U.S. bases as quarantine sites for American evacuees arriving from Wuhan or the surrounding province of Hubei, where the coronavirus originated.\nThe first evacuation flight from Wuhan, carrying 195 State Department employees, their family members and other Americans, arrived Jan. 29 at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles.\nAnother group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from Wuhan arrived on Wednesday aboard two cargo jets - 178 of them taken to Travis Air Force Base in northern California and 167 others to Miramar near San Diego.\nFollowing the same procedures of previous flights, the latest wave of evacuees will be met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening and will be placed under quarantine for 14 days, the extent of the incubation period for the coronavirus, the Pentagon said\n.\nAny who show signs of illness will likely be hospitalized in isolation off base, as have a total of at least six passengers who exhibited fever, cough or other possible symptoms of the disease upon their arrival at Travis and Miramar.\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 30,000 people and killed at least 600, most in and around Wuhan.\nThe CDC has said the risk of widespread transmission of the disease in the United States remains very low, but the Trump administration last week declared a U.S. public health emergency to ensure containment of the virus.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. All but two of the patients were infected while traveling to China. Just two cases are known to have been transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both spouses of individuals who were infected abroad.\nStarting this week, the U.S. government has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently been in China.\nThe CDC also has ordered mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited China’s Hubei Province, while Americans who were elsewhere in mainland China are subject to 14 days of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China are being directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers are screened by the CDC.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - International alarm over the coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December is driven by its rapid spread and the fact that infectious disease experts cannot yet know how deadly or contagious it is.\nWithin weeks, the virus has infected nearly 8,000 people in China and killed 170.\nClose to 100 cases have been confirmed in other countries, from Japan to the United States. On Thursday, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global emergency.\nStatistics from China indicate that just over 2% of people known to be infected with the virus have died, suggesting that it may be less deadly than the coronaviruses behind Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nBut disease experts caution that it will take several more weeks to be confident of how the new virus behaves given how quickly it has spread and the fact that a reliable diagnostic test has only recently been introduced.\n“Not everybody is being seen, not everybody is being tested,” Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters.\n“All the experts, myself included, tell the public that there is much we don’t know about this virus and we are learning as we go along. That is not so reassuring.”\nSome experts question whether the new virus shares similarities with seasonal flu, which has a low mortality rate but infects so many people that more than half a million may die from it each year, according to global health estimates.\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus here\nThe latest statistics indicate a fatality rate of about 2.2%, but the actual rate may be higher or lower as there are likely more unconfirmed cases, he said.\nThe SARS virus killed about 10% of all infected individuals, while the MERS outbreak identified in 2012 had a fatality rate of around 35%\n.\nIn emerging infectious disease outbreaks, the most serious cases are identified first. Coronavirus infections can range from mild cold-like symptoms to severe cases that cause pneumonia, acute respiratory illness and death.\nAbout 20% of confirmed cases in the China coronavirus outbreak are classified as severe, similar to SARS and MERS, Schaffner said.\nGRAPHIC: Online package of China virus news here\nThe previously unknown strain is believed to have originated late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in Wuhan.\nWithin weeks it appeared capable of being transmitted from one person to another via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n“The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than SARS,” said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain’s University of Nottingham.\nThe incubation period is estimated between one and 14 days, and there have been anecdotal accounts of “symptomless spreading” by someone who is infected but unaware of it.\nNeil Ferguson, an infectious disease specialist at Imperial College London, says that is too early to know if so-called “super-spreader” events seen with MERS and SARS is happening with the new coronavirus.\nSome 60 million people are under virtual lockdown in China’s Hubei province – of which Wuhan is the capital. Australia, South Korea, Singapore, New Zealand and Indonesia are quarantining evacuees from China for at least two weeks.\nMany global airlines have suspended or scaled back direct flights to China’s major cities.\nExperts say China has been more forthcoming with information than it was during its 2003 SARS outbreak, but there are still concerns about how much data they are sharing.\nSome also questioned the effectiveness of the quarantine attempt on millions of people.\n“That kind of thing can backfire. It can make it harder to get resources in,” said Dr\n. Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That’s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country’s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China’s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world’s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels\n.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters’ favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China’s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed\n. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The \"new coronavirus infection pneumonia spread early in Wuhan, China\" provides the most detailed epidemiological data on the rapidly spreading epidemic. The authors of this paper are experts from authoritative health institutions in China, and also have considerable administrative responsibilities, including Gao Fu, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, director of China CDC, Feng Zijian, deputy director of China CDC, and Yang Bo, director of Hubei CDC.\nWhat caused much controversy is that the paper pointed out that in 2019, a new coronavirus appeared in Wuhan in mid December. \"The interpersonal communication between close contacts has occurred since mid December and has gradually spread in the following month.\" however, the Wuhan Municipal Health Protection Commission went straight to January 11th. It also said, \"no obvious human transmission phenomenon has been found.\" the 16 day renamed \"does not exclude limited persons.\" The possibility of a successor, but the risk of continuous human transmission is low \"; in addition, it is more controversial that the paper points out that in from January 1st to 11th and 12 to 22, there were 7 and 8 medical staff infected, but until 20, when Xi Jinping was formally addressing the epidemic, Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemic prevention expert, was informed that 15 medical staff were infected when he was interviewed. The Wuhan Health Protection Committee was delayed 21 days before it informed the 15 medical staff of the new coronavirus infection.\nWang Liming, a professor at Zhejiang University, questioned on Weibo: \"this is the first time that I have seen clear evidence, and the evidence of human to human transmission of the new coronavirus has been deliberately concealed!\" the professor asked in an accusatory tone: \"it is the scientists of the CDC who, in order to publish their papers, do not publicize the data? Is the Wuhan municipal government suppressing data disclosure for some reasons? Or what? \" He further questioned: \"as a researcher with first-hand information, you know the exact information about human to human transmission three weeks earlier than the public. Have you done what you should do?\" His post has now been deleted.\nZhang Fengfeng, an epidemiologist at UCLA School of public health, told intellectuals that some Chinese scholars published articles in several internationally renowned magazines in a short period of time. From the data disclosed in the paper, it can be seen that many of them can be used to guide the control of this new infectious disease at the early stage of the outbreak.\nThe publication of this paper and the query of experts shocked the Internet. At the first time, these queries were almost directed at the researchers\n。 The core question that netizens question is when scientists knew when the 2019 new coronavirus would be transmitted to others. Why was it published in foreign periodicals instead of telling the truth to the domestic people earlier? Another is that scientists know that such a paper can not be published at home, so they can \"save the country by curving\" and \"disclose the truth abroad\". It seems obvious that it means to excuse scientists.\nIn the face of doubt, China CDC put forward four explanations on Friday, pointing out that the paper is based on the retrospective analysis of 425 confirmed cases reported as of January 23, and all cases have been released to the society before the paper was written. The 15 cases of infection of medical staff mentioned in the paper were also announced to the public by Zhong Nanshan and Wuhan health and Health Commission respectively from 20th to 21st; the viewpoint that human to human transmission occurred in December last year proposed in the paper \"is a retrospective inference based on the epidemiological investigation data of 425 cases\". Disease control experts use \"retrospective\" to explain that there is no problem that scientists have long known the epidemic and concealed the truth. Feng Zijian, deputy director of the center, was interviewed by the Beijing news about the infection of medical staff. One of the first doctors infected by Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital was hospitalized on January 16. Did the National Center for Disease Control and prevention not receive any information about the suspected infection of medical staff on that day? Feng Zijian said that \"it is not particularly clear\". The reporter asked whether the network direct report system of infectious diseases could directly reach the country within two hours Home level? Feng Zijian replied that \"the use of network direct report is not so early\", because Wuhan pneumonia is a new disease, and there is no infectious disease report in the directory. Adjusting the network direct report system settings requires a process of personnel training. All in all, he denied questions about the data being withheld by the CDC.\nAfter the controversy over the above-mentioned papers, there is also a view that we should not lose focus and focus on researchers. The root of the problem is power. On this point, even Zhou Xianwang, mayor of Wuhan, explained in an interview with CCTV why he didn't disclose the epidemic in time. He said, \"as a local government, I can only disclose it after I get this information and authorize it.\" after that, officials in Wuhan and Hubei made similar statements, which were derided by netizens as \"throwing the pot\".\nSome netizens think that the scientific papers reveal two key facts: one is that there are 425 confirmed cases in January, while 198 cases were published in Wuhan on January 20; the other is that human to human transmission was confirmed at the beginning of January, which was not published until the 20th of Beijing until the local government, which obviously exposed that the Communist Party of China is lying from top to bottom\n。\nA student who claimed to be academician Gao Fu came out to defend the National Center for Disease Control and prevention. He pointed out that the center for Disease Control and prevention formally participated in the epidemic on December 31, confirmed the level II and level I response on January 6, announced the level 8, announced the level 10 sequence and diagnostic reagents, and raised the level 15 to the highest level. The response of disease control met the standard. Another netizen wrote, \"is academician Gao Fu right? Not necessarily. As the director of the center for Disease Control and prevention, he didn't release the epidemic situation in time, and didn't raise the risk level of the virus in a more timely manner. All of these are Gaofu's pots, or at least some of them are his pots. But this is his mistake as an administrator, not as a researcher. \"\nOther netizens questioned why so many things pointed to technical experts and National Centers for Disease Control and prevention all at once in order to dump the pot for the highest level. Technical experts have no right to decide on information disclosure. The key to this epidemic is not to make it public in time.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Experts say the number of people infected with Wuhan virus will exceed 250000 within 14 days, VOA reported.\nAccording to the report, research experts predict that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus in Wuhan will exceed 250000 within 14 days, and the virus will break out in large cities such as beishangguang.\nAfter the outbreak of Wuhan epidemic, the University of Glasgow Centre for virus Research) and four infectious disease biologists from the University of Florida in the United States closely tracked the epidemic situation, and analyzed the epidemic situation and spread using professional models and existing data. On January 23, the Research Report \"2019 new coronavirus: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic prediction\" was released.\nAccording to the report, the basic reproductive number of new coronavirus (????? 0) is significantly greater than one, currently between 3.6 and 4. This shows that the control rate of virus transmission must be between 72% and 75% in order to stop the increase of virus infection; the report estimates that only 5.1% of new coronavirus infection in Wuhan area has been found at present, and there are a large number of undetected virus infections in urban communities.\n\"If there is no change in control or transmission, we expect further outbreaks in other cities in China, and the virus will continue to be exported to overseas regions more rapidly,\" the report quoted the report as saying. Our model predicts that in the next 14 days (February 4, 2020), Wuhan will have more than 250000 virus infected people. Other cities where we expect the largest outbreaks in China are Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Chengdu. We also expect that by February 4, 2020, the countries or special administrative regions most likely to import virus infection through air travel will be Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea. \".\nAccording to the report, the measures taken by Hubei Province to close the city were analyzed, and it was found that these measures were difficult to effectively control the spread of the virus. \"Our model shows that travel restrictions in and out of Wuhan are unlikely to effectively stop the spread of the virus across China; by February 4, if travel is effectively reduced by 99%, the scale of the epidemic outside Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9%,\" the report said\n。\nAccording to the Central News Agency today, more than 40000 people in Wuhan were infected with pneumonia at Hong Kong University Medical College, which declined in the middle of the year.\nAccording to the media report, Liang Zhuowei, Dean of the school of medicine of University of Hong Kong, said today that according to the research model, the current outbreak of the new coronavirus is doubling every 6.2 days. It is estimated that 44 thousand people have been infected in Wuhan. The overall epidemic will be \"peaked\" in 4 and May, and will gradually decrease in 6 and July.\nAccording to the report of Hongkong radio and Xingdao daily, a press conference was held on the afternoon of May 27 to explain the latest epidemic situation of new-type pneumonia. Liang Zhuowei made the above estimate at the meeting. Liang Zhuowei, Dean of the medical school of the University of Hong Kong, said that as of the first day of the new year (25th), it is estimated that there should be no less than 25000 people diagnosed in Wuhan. In addition, there are still cases in the incubation period and without disease, and it is expected that 44000 people have been infected in Wuhan. The basic reproduction rate of the virus is 2.13, which means that the epidemic will double every 6.2 days.\nAccording to Liang Zhuowei, Wuhan is the main transportation hub in Central China. It is estimated that some of the infected people went to other provinces and cities by means of transportation as early as the first day of the new year. At least 18 cases have entered Qingdao, and at most 318 cases have entered Chongqing. He believes that the number of confirmed cases in Wuhan will continue to rise in the future, and he dare not say that the early customs clearance measures have no effect, but as some cases have been exported to other provinces and cities earlier, the epidemic situation in relevant regions will change greatly, and the confirmed cases will continue to appear in the next few weeks.\nLiang predicted that the epidemic would peak in April and may in Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Among them, Chongqing has the most frequent traffic links with Wuhan, with the largest number of people entering and leaving the country. It will reach the peak one to two weeks earlier than other provinces and cities, and the epidemic will slowly decline in June and July.\nAccording to Liang Zhuowei, Dean of the medical school of the University of Hong Kong, the results will be sent to the World Health Organization (who), China National Center for Disease Control and the Hong Kong SAR government for reference.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "● what is the development of \"Wuhan pneumonia\" in Taiwan this week? It is said that the government began to adopt \"electronic monitoring\". Will this make the control measures more effective?\nIt should be more effective. Taiwan's central epidemic command center held an emergency press conference at 8:00 p.m. on the 28th. Chen Shizhong, Minister of health and welfare, personally announced that the \"severe special infectious pneumonia\" in Taiwan had its eighth confirmed case, which was the first local case in Taiwan since the outbreak.\nThis local case is the fifth confirmed case in Taiwan. The husband of the \"Wuhan female Taiwanese businessman\" was infected because they lived together. It was determined to be \"family cluster infection\". In addition, the male Taiwanese businessmen with the previous third confirmed case should have been isolated at home for 14 days after returning to Taiwan, but they did not implement it. They took the MRT, went to the dance hall and went to the Department of dermatology in Kaohsiung. After the diagnosis of the disease, Kaohsiung was panicked. Taiwan's government has implemented \"electronic monitoring\" on those who must be isolated at home since the 29th. There are two types of people who must be isolated at home, including \"contacts of confirmed cases\" and \"returnees from Hubei\".\nAt present, there are about two thousand of these two kinds of people. Each local health bureau will send them a mobile phone with positioning function, which can be monitored in real time through the line community software. Within 14 days of monitoring, the local health unit will actively monitor twice a day through video phone, and the home isolators will also regularly reply to their physical conditions. If they are found to leave or have abnormalities, such as deliberately putting the mobile phone at home After running out, the quarantine personnel will send a message to ask for a reply, and ask to return to the isolation point immediately. If they do not cooperate, the police will immediately assist in finding people, or even force isolation and resettlement. Taiwan officials even revealed that three compulsory isolation places in the north, South and central China have been arranged, but at present, they can't explain where they are. ● over the past week, the United States, Britain, France and Japan have all arranged for the evacuation of overseas Chinese. It was once said that Taiwan would also send charter flights to Wuhan to evacuate the Taiwanese people. What's the situation now?\nThere are more than 2000 Taiwanese businesses in Wuhan for a long time, so it may be difficult to evacuate all of them. At present, the mainland Committee of Taiwan has focused on more than 300 of them. Most of these people come to Wuhan for various reasons, such as temporary business trips, personal travel or family visits. They do not live in local Taiwanese businessmen for a long time. As a result, the city is suddenly closed, making them unable to leave. Some people are short of medicine, living in poor environment, and the situation is worrying. During the Spring Festival, Taiwan government agencies received a More than 100 calls for help\n。\nThe Taiwan Land Commission said it had inquired the mainland through the SEF about the possibility of \"chartering back to Taiwan\", but the mainland did not respond.\nAs a result, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the people's Republic of China responded publicly that since the outbreak of the pneumonia, the Taiwan compatriots in Hubei had been properly taken care of. By the afternoon of January 27, no Taiwan compatriots had been found to be infected with the disease. The Taiwan Affairs Office of Hubei Province and Wuhan city also cared about the situation of the Taiwan compatriots and solved their difficulties in a timely manner. The Taiwan Affairs Office also said that the mainland has always maintained communication with Taiwan related parties, arranged for Taiwan experts to visit Wuhan, and has been timely informing and providing data, and will continue to maintain such communication and coordination in the future. As for the request for chartered flights to evacuate the Taiwan compatriots, the state Taiwan Affairs Office only briefly said that the Association received a letter from the foundation at 6 p.m. on the 27th. However, the state Taiwan Affairs Office did not say whether it agreed. So far, the matter of evacuating the Taiwan compatriots in Wuhan has not been discussed below.\n● during the Spring Festival, some counties and cities in Taiwan have seen long queues of people buying masks. Before that, Taiwan officials also announced that the export of masks is prohibited. Has there been a shortage of masks in Taiwan?\nOn New Year's Eve, Su Zhenchang, Taiwan's chief executive, ordered that the export of medical surgical masks and N95 masks be stopped for one month. This measure was immediately criticized by Lanying. Cai Zhengyuan, the former executive director of the Kuomintang policy meeting, wrote in a Facebook address that when the fire broke out in Australia, Cai Ying Wen announced to donate masks to Australia. However, in Wuhan, the mainland, with pneumonia, Cai Ying Wen's government announced to ban the export of masks, which he thought was strange. He stressed that the smart way to win over international public opinion is to donate masks to the mainland. He exclaimed, \"I haven't seen such a stupid politician.\".\nSecondly, a Taiwanese blogger wrote an article on the Internet, saying that his wife's family from mainland China was in the disaster area of the epidemic and could not buy masks. So he and his wife bought masks everywhere in Taiwan in a few days. They bought a total of 2000 masks and were going to send them to their relatives in mainland China to help them through the difficulties. As a result, two groups of netizens argued on the Internet. One group thought that it was not advisable to sweep the goods to save their relatives, but it was not too harsh. The other group thought that Taiwanese were not enough, and that it was too much to scrape 2000 masks.\nIn fact, there is no shortage of masks in Taiwan, but it is also a fact that there are people lining up to buy masks during the Spring Festival. In some places, the long lines are hundreds of meters long, which is really worrying\n。 However, this should be a temporary phenomenon. On the one hand, the official ban on the export of masks is the main reason. On the other hand, the production of mask factories is not large due to the suspension of work during the Spring Festival. In addition, people's expectations finally lead to the phenomenon of rush buying. But the first day after the Spring Festival on the 30th, the problem has been solved. As a result of the coordination between the government and the mask manufacturers, the manufacturers stepped up their work. The government purchased 4 million masks from the operators every day, and unified the distribution channels for the whole Taiwan. Judging from the current epidemic situation in Taiwan, the supply of masks should not be a problem, but the problem is the hostile political position of both sides.\nIn addition, the World Health Organization again held an emergency committee meeting in Geneva on the 30th, but still did not invite Taiwan experts to attend. What is Taiwan's response?\nWHO (WHO) secretary general Tan Desai (Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus) visited Beijing several days ago to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping. After 29 returned to Geneva, a press conference was held in the evening. She said that although the number of cases outside China is still very small, the potential of global transmission is likely to expand further. Therefore, WHO30 will convene experts to discuss the new coronavirus pneumonia. Whether the epidemic constitutes an international public health emergency. At the press conference, the media asked why Taiwan was not invited to participate in the conference. Ryan, executive director of who emergency health events, replied that Taiwan experts participated in who related consultation, clinical and laboratory work, so Taiwan fully participated in and fully understood all the development. In response, Lane asked Maria van kerkhove, the deputy head of the emerging diseases department of who, to add to the questions about the participation of Taiwan experts. Van khove also said that the who did contact all countries with cases. Therefore, although Taiwan requests to participate in the WHO meeting every time a global infectious disease occurs, it also accuses China of not preventing Taiwan from participating, and China also responds, and Taiwan can get all the information. From who's point of view, I'm afraid there is no plan to let Taiwan participate in the meeting in the short term.\nThe Ministry of foreign affairs of Taiwan stressed that Taiwan has a sound medical and epidemic prevention system, and is capable and ready to make specific contributions. It once again appealed to WHO to hold the profession and invite Taiwan to attend the expert meeting against new coronaviruses.\n。 Taiwan also called on who to put aside political pressure, work professionally and neutrally to implement the purpose of \"achieving the highest level of human health\" as stipulated in the Charter of the organization, and resume inviting Taiwan to attend the World Health Assembly held in Geneva in May as an observer, so as to ensure that there is no loophole in global epidemic prevention.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "●本周台湾的「武汉肺炎」疫情有什么发展？据说官方开始采取「电子监控」，这会让管制措施更有成效吗？\n应该会比较有成效。台湾的中央流行疫情指挥中心28日晚间8时紧急召开记者会，卫福部长陈时中亲自宣布，「严重特殊传染性肺炎」台湾出现了第八个确定病例，这也是疫情爆发以来，台湾的第一件本土病例。\n这个本土病例，是台湾第五个确诊病例那位「武汉女台商」的丈夫，因为两人住在一起而被传染，判定是「家庭群聚感染」。加上之前第三个确诊病例的男性台商，返台之后本应居家隔离14天，却没有落实，在高雄搭捷运、去舞厅跳舞、去皮肤科看诊等，发病确诊后搞得高雄人心惶惶。台湾官方已经从29日开始，对必须居家隔离者实施「电子监控」，所谓「必须居家隔离者」有两种人，包括「确诊病例的接触者」和「从湖北返台者」。\n这两种人目前共有大约两千人，各地方卫生局会发给他们一支具备定位功能的手机，透过Line社群软件实时监控，在监控的14天内，地方卫生单位每天会透过视讯电话主动监测两次，居家隔离者也要定期回复身体状况，如果发现离开或出现异常，比如故意把手机放家里跑出去，检疫人员会发简讯要求回复，并要求立刻回到隔离点，如果不配合，立即由警方协助找人，甚至强制隔离安置。台湾官方甚至透露，北中南三个强制隔离的地点都已经安排好了，但目前不能对外说明是在哪里。●一周以来，包括美国、英国、法国、日本都已经安排撤侨，台湾一度传出也要派包机去武汉，撤出台湾民众。现在情况如何呢？\n台湾在武汉长期经商的台商约有两千多位，全部撤离可能有困难。目前台湾陆委会把焦点锁定在其中三百多人，这些人多数都是因为临时出差、个人旅游或探亲等各种原因到武汉，并不是长期住在当地的台商，结果突然封城，让他们无法离开，有的人身上药品缺乏、居住环境很差，状况令人担忧，台湾政府机关在春节期间接到一百多通这类求救电话。\n台湾陆委会说，他们透过海基会向大陆探询「用包机接回台湾」的可能性，但大陆没有回应。\n结果，国台办公开响应说，肺炎疫情发生以来，在湖北的台胞得到妥善照顾，到1月27日下午，没有发现台胞染病，湖北省台办、武汉市台办也都有关心台胞情况，及时解决他们的困难。国台办还说，大陆一直和台湾有关方面保持沟通，安排台湾专家到武汉考察，并一直及时通报讯息、提供数据，接下来会继续保持这种沟通协调。至于包机撤离台胞的要求，国台办只简短地说，大陆海协会是在27日下午六点收到海基会的函件的。但是否同意，国台办并没有说。到目前为止，撤离武汉台胞的事，还没有下文。\n●春节期间，台湾有部分县市出现民众大排长龙买口罩的现象，之前台湾官方也曾宣布，禁止口罩出口，难道台湾已经出现口罩供不应求的现象吗？\n有关口罩的风波，除夕当天，台湾行政院长苏贞昌曾下令，停止出口医疗外科口罩和N95口罩一个月，这个措施立刻受到蓝营批评。国民党政策会前执行长蔡正元在脸书发文，提到澳洲大火时，蔡英文宣布捐赠口罩给澳洲，但大陆武汉肺炎，蔡英文政府却宣布禁止口罩出口，他认为，这样处理很奇怪。强调，要争取国际舆论，聪明的办法是捐赠口罩给大陆，他感叹说「没看过那么笨的政客」。\n其次就是，有一位台湾的部落客在网上写了一篇文章，说他大陆籍妻子的家人，在大陆深陷疫情灾区，买不到口罩，于是他和妻子在几天内在台湾到处买口罩，总共买了两千个，准备寄给在大陆的亲戚，帮他们度过难关。结果在网络上引起两派网民论战，一派认为想救亲人而扫货的做法虽不可取但情有可缘，不需太过苛责；另一派则认为台湾人都不够用，搜刮两千个口罩实在太超过。\n其实，台湾并不缺口罩，但春节期间到处有人排队买口罩也是事实，有的地方大排长龙达几百公尺，看了实在令人担心。不过这应该是暂时的现象，主因一方面是官方宣布禁止口罩出口，其次是口罩工厂因为春节停工休息，所以产量不多，加上民众预期心理，终于导致抢购现象。但30日开春后第一天上班，这个问题已经迎刃而解。政府和口罩厂商协调结果，由厂商加紧赶工，政府每天向业者征购400万片口罩，统一调度给全台的贩卖通路，从台湾目前的疫情来看，口罩的供应应该不是问题，有问题的是两岸敌对的政治立场。\n●另外，世界卫生组织30日再度在日内瓦召开紧急委员会议，这次仍然没有邀请台湾的专家出席，台湾方面有什么回应呢？\n世界卫生组织（WHO）秘书长谭德塞（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）前几天访问北京会见中国国家主席习近平，29返回日内瓦后在晚间举行记者会提到，虽然中国境外的病例仍然很少，但全球传播的潜力可能会进一步扩大，因此WHO30日会召集专家开会，讨论新型冠状病毒肺炎疫情是否构成「国际关注公共卫生紧急事件」。记者会上有媒体问到为什么没有邀请台湾参与会议的事，WHO突发卫生事件执行主任莱恩回答说，台湾专家参参与了WHO相关咨询、以及临床和实验室等工作，因此台湾充分参与并充分了解所有发展情况。莱恩回答之后，要旁边的世卫新兴疾病部门代理主管范科霍芙（Maria Van Kerkhove）针对台湾专家参与的问题再做补充，范科霍芙也说，WHO确实与所有出现病例的国家都进行接触。所以，虽然台湾在每次全球性传染病发生时都要求参与WHO的会议，也指责中国大陆不该阻止台湾参与，而中国大陆也都回应，台湾都能获得所有信息。从WHO的态度看来，短期内恐怕没有打算让台湾参加会议。\n台湾外交部则强调，台湾有完善的医疗和防疫体系，有能力、且已准备好做出具体贡献，再次呼吁WHO秉持专业，邀请台湾出席对抗新型冠状病毒的专家会议。台湾也呼吁WHO摒除政治压力，以专业、中立的态度致力落实组织宪章明订的「达致全人类最高健康水平」的宗旨，恢复邀请台湾以观察员身分出席五月间在日内瓦召开的世界卫生大会，以确保全球防疫没有漏洞。\n",

But we have not received the final numbers of Malaysians coming back,” she told reporters after attending a Chinese New Year Open House organised by the Federation of Chinese Associations Malaysia (Hua Zong) at Wisma Hua Zong here tonight.Dr Wan Azizah, who is also the National Disaster Management Committee chairman, said in a statement this afternoon that the AirAsia AK8264 departed at 3.50pm with 12 crew and eight HADR mission personnel from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (klia2) for Wuhan, China to bring home 141 Malaysians and their family members.The aircraft also brought with it 500,000 pairs of rubber gloves as a contribution to the Chinese government in an effort to contain the 2019-nCoV outbreak in the country.As for the return flight to Kuala Lumpur, it was reported that the returning Malaysians and their family members would have to undergo health screening according to conditions set by the Chinese authorities before they can board the plane to Malaysia.At the event, which was also attended by Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Bai Tian, Hua Zong president Tan Sri Goh Tian Chuan, Works Minister Baru Bian, Youth and Sports Deputy Minister Steven Sim Chee Keong and Deputy Health Minister Lee Boon Chye, a Yee Sang tossing ceremony was held as a symbol of prosperity.The coronavirus outbreak in China was a topic of conversation at the gathering, with both sides expressing the hope that the health crisis would end soon and more lives can be saved.Bai Tian in his speech said China was working hard to curb the spread of coronavirus, which has claimed 361 lives in the republic and infected 17,205 people in 27 countries as at yesterday.“Fair to say that Chinese New Year in China is not joyful; a medical team has rushed to Wuhan city and we have confidence to put an end to this epidemic. Thanks to Malaysia for its continuous support, and we know China is not fighting this battle alone,” he said.-- BERNAMA    \r\n ",

They were together with 200 British and others\nCitizens previously arrived at a British military airport near Oxford.\nThe\nAccording to Berlin Health Senator Dilek Kalayci (SPD) they were first boarded at the military part of the airport\nexamined by an official physician and tested for the corona virus. You will spend two weeks in an isolation area of DRK clinics in\nAccommodation in Berlin-Copenhagen. The results of the tests\nshould be available by Monday afternoon.\nAlready a week ago, about a hundred German citizens and their family members had flown to Frankfurt am Main by a German army machine. Two of them tested positive for the virus.\nThe number of deaths caused by the new Coronavirus, meanwhile, has exceeded that of the Sars pandemic 17 years ago. China's health department reported new deaths on Sunday morning 89. So far, 811 people have been killed by lung disease worldwide. Due to Sars respiratory disease, 2002/2003 worldwide 774 patients had died.\nAir China announced on Sunday night that it would \"adapt\" its connections between China and the USA due to the Coronavirus epidemic. The website of the company can be seen that numerous flights between Beijing and Washington as well as to other American cities up to 28. were deleted in March. However, some of the connections between Beijing and Los Angeles, as well as San Francisco and New York, continue to operate the airline.\nThe number of confirmed infections in China recently increased to approximately 37.200. Outside the People's Republic there are more than 270 other cases in more than two dozen countries, of which 14 diseases in Germany\nYeah.\nChina plans to fight the epidemic\nconverted into almost ten billion euros. Amongst other things, the money is intended to ensure that:\nthat all Chinese take a virus test and treatment\nThe Ministry of Finance informed us. It should also be avoided that financial\nLimits the use to contain Corona in the individual\nRegional handicap.\nThe growing number of infections and deaths caused by\nnew virus frightens many Chinese who on Monday\nafter the extended New Year's holidays at their place of work\nreturn. In the social media, discontent with the\nAuthorities and doubts about the official case numbers are loud. The\nVacation had been extended to contain the spread of the virus.\nIn Spain, meanwhile, a second infection with\nCoronavirus confirmed. In Mallorca be one person\ntested positive for the pathogen, the national\nMicrobiology centre. Tests on three other persons\nnegative results. The four are with someone in France\nhave been in contact where the disease subsequently\nhad been diagnosed. Five new cases had previously been reported in France. The French Minister for Health, Agnes Buzyn, said that a child and four adults with British citizenship had been tested positive for the virus in France. Twelve cases in Germany refer to a Chinese employee of the Bavarian car supplier Webasto. Two returnees from China were also tested positively. In addition, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) data (Friday evening stand) there are cases in Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia, Belgium, Finland and Sweden. There are at least 37 infected people in Europe.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation WHO a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan\nYeah. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death\nYeah. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nAccording to its own information, the WHO opposes the dissemination of false information concerning the new virus. They caused confusion and fear in the population, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\n\" We are therefore also fighting the trolls and conspiracy theorists who spread false information and thus undermine the work against the outbreak,\"Tedros said. To do this, you should be in contact with numerous social networks.\" We have asked them to filter out false information and to promote correct information from reliable sources.\"On Instagram and YouTube, the WHO has also sought contact with influenza sufferers and influenza sufferers and has asked them to spread factual news about the virus. According to Tedros, the focus is on the Asia-Pacific region.\nAccording to a study by Chinese scientists, the novel virus could also be transmitted via faeces. Some patients in a hospital in Wuhan would have had diarrhoea and nausea before the onset of fever symptoms and difficulty breathing, according to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\nThe course of the disease started with diarrhoea and nausea for ten percent of 138 patients, writes the scientists. They indicated that in the early cases of the first disease to occur in Wuhan in December, they all focused on respiratory symptoms. Symptoms associated with the digestive tract may have been overlooked.\nThe Sars virus, which is also caused by coronary viruses, was also partially transmitted during the epidemic at the beginning of the zero years. David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, warned that faecal infection, especially in hospitals, could pose a new challenge for the control of viral disease. The main route of transmission of the virus continues to be a drop infection via the cough of a patient.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Now the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV has also appeared in Germany. Health systems are well prepared for this. In the country of origin, however, thousands are infected and it is still uncertain how dangerous the organism is. There are no medicines to treat the sick. Rolf Hilgenfeld is trying to help. The biochemist has been on his way to China since last week.\nTIME ONLINE: Mr Hilgenfeld, what are you actually doing?\nRolf Hilgenfeld: I want to find out if the inhibitors we developed at the University of Lubeck work as well against the new Coronavirus as against Sars and Mers viruses. I'm here looking for collaborators who have cell cultures with the new virus to test the substances on. However, our substances are still at an experimental stage. Unfortunately, they are still a long way from being used as a medicine in the current outbreak.\nTIME ONLINE: Still no medicine for the new virus?\nHilgenfeld: No, not yet approved, because 2019-nCoV has just been discovered. However, experience has been gained with various medicines during the Sars outbreak 2002 and 2003. And a combination of two substances proved particularly promising in the first clinical trials: the combination of the active substances lopinavir and ritonavir. It's actually anti-HIV medicine.\nTIME ONLINE: You're saying you should give Coronavirus patients aids?\nThis is how it is. Especially in outbreaks such as these, there are regular attempts to re-dedicate already authorised medicines. This has the advantage that these products have already been tested intensively on humans and can therefore be considered safe. This saves you years of testing, because usually when you break out, time is of the essence. Now it takes far too long to develop something new\nYeah. And Lopinavir and ritonavir are only allowed against HIV.\nTIME ONLINE: How do these medicines work?\nHelpful field: In order to multiply, RNA viruses, like 2019-nCoV, form very large protein molecules. They must then be cut into individual components by certain enzymes in order for the virus to multiply. That's what you're trying to prevent. You can do that by inhibiting the enzymes. The good news is, these enzymes are very similar to the individual coronavirus. We investigated this in Lubeck before the Sars outbreak 2002. Back then, Coronaviruses were still considered unimportant to humans. They thought they'd cause a cold. At the time, many even advised me to stop these \"unimportant\" works. And shortly after the Sars pandemic began, we were the only ones who had ever clarified three-dimensional structures of coronavirus proteins. On this basis, we have already developed a substance that can inhibit coronavirus. We were able to suggest that a medicine that should actually work against rhinoviruses, the typical \"flu viruses\", should also be effective against coronavirus after slight changes.\nTIME ONLINE: If so, why can't you use the substance in the current outbreak?\nHelp field: It is still in experimental condition. In order to be able to use it, it has to be developed into a medicine in years of research. When we wanted to run more tests back then, the Sars outbreak was over and we had no patients to test the substance on. This is also a fundamental problem for all research in this field.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation WHO a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan\nYeah. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires.

The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it.

This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nONLINE TIME: What do you mean?\nHelp field: First you have to show in an animal experiment that a substance is safe and then that it works. But you can't just infect a mouse with coronavirus, you have to plant an extra human receptor in the mouse, you have to \"humanize\" it. It takes months.\nYeah. And only then will the examinations of patients begin, which will last for years to come. And when you finally get there, there are no more patients to try the drugs on because the outbreak is over. This is why it is difficult to find funding. And the pharmaceutical industry is not interested in coronavirus. Even the 8.000 Sars cases at the time are not a lucrative market for companies. That is also why we now have no effective medicine against the new virus.\nONLINE TIME: Viruses change their heritage when they multiply. Does that also make it so difficult to develop an effective medicine?\nHelpful field: It is sometimes read that Coronaviruses mutate particularly quickly. That's not true at all. The virus does not change as quickly as influenza viruses, for example. The mutation rates are lower. This is because Coronaviruses are quite effective in correcting the errors that occur when they multiply. So that's not the reason why there's still no authorized drug for coronavirus. In fact, it is not so difficult to develop one if only there were more support for research.\nTIME ONLINE: Are there any other medicines besides lopinavir and ritonavir that have already been tested and would be readily available?\nHelp field: I think another medicine is promising: Remdesivir. It was originally developed against the Ebola virus. In cell cultures, however, it also works against other RNA viruses, for example against Sars and Mers Coronaviruses. That's why they call it a broad-spectrum drug. I think it is possible that Remdesivir could also work against the new 2019-CnoV. And I assume that the WHO will also recommend the drug in the current outbreak.\nTIME ONLINE: What are the chances that it actually works?\nHelp field: You have to see this\nYeah. Finally, unlike the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, it has never been used in humans against coronavirs. In this respect, it can be described as experimental, but it has already been tested for its safety in humans. Both drugs, and perhaps also interferon beta, should now be tested as soon as possible in clinical studies to know if they work.\nTIME ONLINE: Could this stop the current Coronavirus outbreak?\nHelpfeld: It is difficult to predict because many aspects of the outbreak have not yet been clarified. But after everything that's been known about these drugs so far, I think it's possible to break the chain of infection and stop the outbreak.\nONLINE TIME: Treatment is one thing. In addition, there would be the option of immunising people with a vaccine against the Coronavirus. What's the status?\nHelpful field: Currently several organizations around the world are working on a vaccine, for example the Chinese Center for Disease Control, but also the National Institutes of Health in the USA. They seem to hope to be able to start tests on patients in the first half of the year. That would be very quick. Sars took almost two years to start the first clinical trials with vaccines after the virus was decoded.\nTIME ONLINE: Could vaccine candidates developed against Sars and Mers serve as the basis for a vaccine against the new Coronavirus?\nAuxiliary field: The aim of the vaccines is the so-called spike protein, which you have to think of as spikes on the viral envelope. And, unlike the enzymes that are attacked by the AIDS medicines Lopinavir/ritonavir, they differ significantly depending on the type of virus. The spike protein of the Wuhan virus is only 51 percent identical to that of the Sars-Coronavirus. This makes a vaccine that works against many coronary viruses equally unlikely.\nYeah. Even if it is quick: it will take months for a specific vaccine against 2019-nCoV to be developed and ready for use.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Letters and parcels from China? Can be received without driving. Vaccines for pneumonia? Don't help with the new Coronavirus. Should I eat garlic? It's healthy, but there's no evidence that it's protecting it from the pathogen.\nThese questions and answers come from the World Health Organisation (WHO) website. Under a heading called myth busters, the WHO tries to fight myths. The United Nations authority is thus trying to counter the rumours about the new Coronavirus. Because rumors, misinformation and conspiracy theories spread faster than the virus itself.\nAt the end of 2019, a new virus broke out in China, 2019nCoV, closely related to the deadly Sars virus. Meanwhile, thousands of people have been infected, hundreds have died, and many countries have long reported cases. Because the pathogen was unknown last year and the consequences of the outbreak are not yet predictable, there is a great need for knowledge: Google Trends is showing a rapid increase in the corona virus in January. A demand that remains undiscovered: more than 15 million tweets about the Coronavirus have been posted on Twitter in the last four weeks, and new news and assessments are appearing daily in the media. There are so many contributions that the WHO writes about an information epidemic, an abundance of information, correct but also wrong.\nIn general, it is necessary to distinguish between uncertain information, news ripped out of context or false news and conspiracy theories. For example, the story of a couple of parents who allegedly left their two sick children at the airport is circulating online. There's no proof of that. Just like a video that spreads in alarmist tones alleged facts about the virus\nYeah. The claims in it are partly exaggerated, partly unfounded, partly incorrect, as the Correctiv portal has researched. But there are conspiracy theories. It is said that the outbreak was based on a plot by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. That's not true either.\nNow you may find this information harmless. In part, however, the false information circulating around the new Coronavirus is harmful, even life-threatening. About when they advertise supposed remedies or treatments. For example, the Indian Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Natural Medicine recommends homeopathic treatment of coronary lung disease. The effect of homeopathy beyond the placebo effect has not been demonstrated. And there's a rumor on Facebook that it cures a coronavirus infection by drinking a chemical solution called MMS. This is not only wrong, but even life-threatening when used. Facebook, usually not known for its intensive handling of false content, has now announced to remove corresponding posts from its platform. Twitter not only wants to delete misleading posts, but only to find credible information when searching for the Coronavirus, it says in a blog post.\nThe media dynamics that can be observed at the moment are not new. It resembles other news stories, whether terrorist attack or plane crash: first something bad happens, then information spreads in the social media in minutes, and finally media reports. People read posts or articles, look for more information, for certainty. But because there is still little certainty, there is room for rumors, false information and even conspiracy theories.\nYeah. The effect is reinforced by the fact that the level of knowledge around the centre of the news, in this case the corona virus disease, can constantly change and what seems certain today could be refuted tomorrow.\nNicole Kramer works as a professor of social psychology at the University of Duisburg-Essen and researches, among other things, on Fake News. She sees several reasons for spreading false and uncertain information: \"There is still a lot of uncertainty about the Coronavirus,\" she says, \"and because the outbreak is threatening to become a pandemic, and so everyone in Germany could eventually be in danger of getting infected, the need for information was particularly great. People sent information they see too quickly, Kramer says, often without having read the message accurately. Images with particularly frightening motives, such as pictures from overcrowded hospital halls, on which patients lie on the floor, fired this: \"Some texts will certainly be passed on because the power of the images is so strong,\" says Kr am er. We are all responsible for spreading false information.\" It is less relevant who puts the wrong message into the world, but who disseminates it. And these are mostly people, not bots,\"says Kramer.\nBut, of course, misinformation is not only unwittingly disseminated. There are also actors who purposefully disseminate the information, Kramer says. These could be laymen who simply want attention, but also state actors who want to create unrest.\nAdditionally, especially on health issues, much reliance is placed on the experience of others, communications scientist Markus Schafer of the University of Mainz told ZDF. Together with colleagues, he has investigated how Internet users learn about health\nYeah. According to this, almost every second respondent (46 percent) claims to be informed about health issues in personal conversations with family, friends and colleagues. 39 percent use the Internet, in the age group from 18 to 29 there were even 46 percent (journal for online consulting and computer-mediated communication: Shepherd et al., 2019). Only health issues are often very complex.\" That is why misinformation in this area spreads so well,\"says Schafer. Medicine is not an exact science. In medical practice, scientific knowledge and experience come together. There is sometimes more room for rumours than for scientific questions.\nThe impact of such false information is not only problematic in the short term, but also in the long term. In psychology, one speaks of the misinformation effect: if one reads incorrect information directly after an event, it can lead to one noticing it, even if one should actually know that it is not true (for example Loftus, 2005).\" This is normal in evolutionary psychology,\"says social psychologist Kramer. At first we believed what we saw and did not immediately doubt everything. The problem was that misinformation would be as well received as facts. The wrong information could hardly be overwritten. Therefore, even if people have read a correction, they may remember the wrong information.\nIt becomes even more difficult when the false information you read fits into your own worldview. Because we all tend to believe what we want to believe. In psychology, it's called confirmation bias. In the case of the Coronavirus, this is good to observe: anyone who wants to believe that the world is in the midst of a pandemic will find and share information that suits them. If you want to believe the pathogen is harmless, find the opposite information\nYeah. It is still unclear how deadly the virus really is, and whether the outbreak will take on a global scale.\nSo how do you make sure that what you read is actually true?\" Those who see a text online should not just share it, but read it all,\"says social psychologist Kramer. It also helps to keep an eye on the sources. Is a contribution based on scientific knowledge? Can you check what's in there? Does anyone just quote from other media? What is the original source? Is there even one? This may sound trivial, but can effectively help identify misinformation. According to Kramer, the media, too, would be responsible for correcting reports if they originally contained false information.\nExperts are already calling for a global media strategy for future outbreaks of disease.\" We need effective media observers to monitor how outbreaks of disease are reported,\"writes Ilona Kickbusch, professor of global health in Geneva, and Gabriel Leung, Dean of Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, in a paper for the British Medical Journal. In the future, the WHO should not only contact social media, but also work with well-known fact-tellers. It is also possible to find out whether information would be withheld or whether critical journalists and journalists would be silenced.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires\nYeah. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person\nYeah. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nRead more about the outbreak of the new Coronavirus here.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The number of patients with the novel corona virus behind lung disease in China has risen sharply again. Four infections have been confirmed in Germany. The three new cases announced on Tuesday evening are related to the first patient in Bavaria who had contracted it from a colleague from China. In the People's Republic the number of diseases increased within one day to Wednesday at 1459. This covers more than 6000 cases. Other 26 patients died in China. Thus the total number of deaths climbed to 132.\nWhile there are a little more than 80-year-old infections outside the People's Republic, the Health Commission in Beijing counted patients alone in China until Wednesday around 5951. There are almost ten thousand suspicious cases. The Commission even reported cases of 5974, but counted 23 infections in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao. Beijing regards these territories as part of the People's Republic. Therefore, 1239 patients are severely ill. Deaths are usually older patients with pre-existing illnesses.\nOutside the People's Republic there are also people with the new virus in Thailand, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, the USA, Australia or South Korea. In Europe, four cases have also been confirmed in France. Most of the patients were previously in China. However, there are also increasingly infections that have occurred outside in contact with travellers from China, such as most recently in Japan and Taiwan. Thus, the Beijing government has advised its citizens to postpone travel abroad for the time being.\nIn China, the eleven million metropolis of Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei in Central China are particularly hard hit. Around 45 million people were shot to death there. Flights and short- and long-distance transport have been suspended\nYeah. Japan began to bring back first compatriots from the area. A charter machine with 206 people from Wuhan landed in Tokyo on Wednesday.\nThe passengers did not use the normal flight terminal for regular passengers, but were taken to a medical facility in a special bus. More flights will follow, as around 650-Japanese want to return. Germany and other countries, such as the USA, South Korea or India, are also considering, or are already planning, concrete similar recovery actions. In Wuhan there are about 90-Germans. How many of them want to go to Germany is unclear. Australia, too, wants to expel citizens from the crisis region, but to quarantine them for a 14-day period on Christmas Island.\nAccording to the Bavarian Ministry of Health, as in the first case, the three new patients in Germany are also employees of the car supplier Webasto in Stockdorf (Bavaria). \"It has been decided that the three new patients at the Munich clinic Schwabing will also be admitted stationary and medically monitored and isolated,\" the ministry said. \"Some other contact persons are currently undergoing a test to see if there is also an infection with the Coronavirus.\"\nBecause of the infections, Webasto closes its headquarters in the Upper Bavarian village of Stockdorf, a part of Gauting, until Sunday. Until then, employees of the company headquarters should also not travel to national and international locations, as the company announced on Tuesday evening. Webasto is a major supplier for the automotive industry with a total of 13 400 employees at 50-locations worldwide. There are twelve locations in China, one of them in Wuhan. The infected Chinese woman who had come to the company seminar had contracted it with her parents in the city. She did not develop symptoms until returning to China on the 23rd. January\nYeah.\nIn the fight against the virus, new reporting obligations are being imposed on airlines and hospitals in Germany, according to Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). In the case of flights from China, pilots should inform the Tower of the health of the passengers prior to landing. Travellers from China should provide information on their flight, whereabouts and accessibility in the next thirty days in forms. Clinics will also have to report cases of Coronavirus suspicion to the Robert Koch Institute in the future, not just confirmed cases.\nThe first patient with the new virus in Germany, a 33-year-old from Landsberg am Lech district, is being treated at the isolation station at the Munich clinic Schwabing, as Clemens Wendtner, chief physician at the clinic, said. He's all right. The incubation period is up to two weeks in the case of lung disease. However, infected people are already contagious even before they show symptoms, which makes it particularly difficult to contain the virus.\nThe new virus 2019-nCoV originated probably from a market in Wuhan, where it probably jumped from there traded wild animals to humans. Symptoms, including dry cough, fever and shortness of breath, can be alleviated with medication. According to current experts, lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, in some cases even without symptoms. The new pathogen is very similar to the virus behind the Sars pandemic 2002/2003, which also broke out in China. Back then, 8000-year-old people were sick. Barely 800 died.\nAustralian scientists have been breeding the Coronavirus in the laboratory. The Peter Doherty Institute for Infections and Immunity in Melbourne reported this on Wednesday. It is now possible to work together with other institutes and the World Health Organisation on an antidote. (dpa)\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "中国肺病背后的新型冠状病毒感染者人数再次大幅上升。德国已确认有4例感染。星期二晚上宣布的三个新病例与巴伐利亚州第一个从中国同事那里感染的病人有关。在中华人民共和国，从一天到星期三，疾病数量增加了1459种。这涉及6000多个案件。其他26名患者在中国死亡。因此，死亡总数攀升至132人。\n虽然在中华人民共和国境外有超过80岁的感染者，但是北京的卫生委员会统计到周三为止，仅在中国就有5951名患者。有近万起可疑案件。该委员会甚至报告了5974例病例，但统计了香港、台湾和澳门的23例感染病例。北京将这些领土视为中华人民共和国的一部分。因此，1239名患者病情严重。死亡通常是有先天疾病的老年患者。\n在中华人民共和国以外的泰国、日本、新加坡、马来西亚、美国、澳大利亚或韩国也有感染新病毒的人。在欧洲，法国也确认了4例。大多数病人以前在中国。然而，与来自中国的旅行者接触的外来感染者也越来越多，例如最近在日本和台湾。因此，北京政府建议市民暂时推迟出国旅游。\n在中国，1100万大都市武汉和中国中部的湖北省受到的打击尤其严重。大约4500万人在那里被枪杀。航班和短途和长途运输已经暂停\n是 啊。日本开始从该地区带回第一批同胞。一架载有206人的武汉包机周三在东京降落。\n这些乘客没有为普通乘客使用正常的航班航站楼，而是乘坐一辆专车被送往医疗机构。接下来将有更多的航班，约650名日本人希望返回。德国和其他国家，如美国、韩国或印度，也在考虑或已经在计划采取具体的类似恢复行动。在武汉大约有90个德国人。他们中有多少人想去德国还不清楚。澳大利亚也希望将公民驱逐出危机地区，但希望在圣诞岛将他们隔离14天。\n据巴伐利亚州卫生部称，与第一例一样，德国的三名新病人也是汽车供应商Webasto在斯托克多夫（巴伐利亚州）的雇员。卫生部说：“已经决定，慕尼黑施瓦宾诊所的三名新病人也将被固定入院，并接受医学监测和隔离。”。“其他一些接触者目前正在接受检测，看是否也有冠状病毒感染。”\n由于感染，韦巴斯特关闭了位于上巴伐利亚州斯托克多夫村的总部，这是戈廷的一部分，直到星期天。在那之前，公司总部的员工也不应该前往国内和国际地点，正如公司周二晚间宣布的那样。伟巴斯特是汽车行业的主要供应商，在全球50个地区共有13400名员工。中国有十二个地方，其中一个在武汉。来参加公司研讨会的受感染的中国妇女与她在该市的父母有过接触。直到23日返回中国，她才出现症状。一月\n是 啊。\n德国卫生部长延斯•斯帕恩（Jens Spahn）表示，在抗击该病毒的斗争中，德国航空公司和医院正在承担新的报告义务。如果是从中国起飞的航班，飞行员应在降落前通知塔台乘客的健康状况。来自中国的旅客应以表格形式提供未来30天的航班、行踪和无障碍情况。诊所今后还必须向罗伯特·科赫研究所报告疑似冠状病毒的病例，而不仅仅是确诊病例。\n德国首例感染新病毒的患者是兰兹贝格-阿姆-莱赫区的33岁老人，正如该诊所主任医师克莱门斯·温特纳（Clemens Wendtner）所说，他正在慕尼黑施瓦宾诊所的隔离站接受治疗。他没事。如果是肺病，潜伏期可达两周。然而，感染者在出现症状之前就已经具有传染性，这使得控制病毒变得特别困难。\n2019年新病毒nCoV可能起源于武汉的一个市场，在那里它可能从交易野生动物到人类。症状，包括干咳，发烧和气短，可以通过药物缓解。据目前的专家说，肺病在大多数情况下似乎是轻微的，在某些情况下甚至没有症状。这种新的病原体与2002/2003年在中国爆发的Sars大流行背后的病毒非常相似。当时，8000岁的老人生病了。只有800人死亡。\n澳大利亚科学家一直在实验室里培育冠状病毒。墨尔本的彼得·多尔蒂感染与免疫研究所周三报道了这一情况。现在有可能与其他研究所和世界卫生组织合作研究解毒剂。（dpa）\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new Coronavirus from China has now also arrived in Germany. The Bavarian health authorities confirmed the first four cases in the Federal Republic on Tuesday.\nAt first the new lung disease had been detected in a 33-year-old man from Landsberg am Lech district. He was infected in his company in a suburb of Munich with a colleague from China. On Tuesday evening, the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced that three more people were infected with the new Coronavirus. \"These patients are also employees of Starnberg County,\" he continued.\nThe four persons concerned were admitted stationary at the Munich clinic Schwabing, where they were medically monitored and isolated, as the Ministry reported. \"Some other contact persons are currently being tested for an infection with the Coronavirus as well.\" Bayern's Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) said, \"The company's total number of 40 employees who are eligible as close contacts has been identified. The people concerned should be tested on Wednesday as a precautionary measure.\"Then the Ministry also wants to inform the press about the current situation.\nAccording to information from the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), the 33-year-old had contracted an infection with a colleague from China who had received training last week on the Webasto car supplier in the Gautinger district of Stockdorf in the Upper Bavarian district of Starnberg. The woman didn't have her infection until 23rd. January on the return flight to China.\nThe new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV can cause a lung disease in which more than 100 people have already died in the main country of China, most of which were elderly patients with severe pre-existing diseases.\nYeah. The total number of known diseases worldwide has now increased to more than 4500, with at least 106 people dying of lung disease in China.\nThe first Coronavirus patient had tested positive for the virus on Monday and had gone back to work. \"He is quite well, he was still working yesterday morning,\" LGL President Andreas Zapf said. \"He is fever-free and has no respiratory symptoms at the moment,\" added Chief Medical Officer Clemens Wendtner of Schwabing Clinic. The man is in an isolation room, there was no danger to other patients.\nAccording to LGL data, the people who had contact with the Chinese and the first sick German Webasto employee are under observation and are urged not to leave their home. According to the Ministry of Health, his child goes to a crib in Landsberg am Lech district. This too is now under observation, LGL President Zapf said. The family status of the three other patients was not known at first. The head of the Infectiology Task Force, Martin Hoch, stressed: \"The number can still rise.\"\nThe new virus 2019-nCoV was originally believed to originate from a market in the Chinese millionaire city of Wuhan, where wild animals traded there probably jumped to humans. According to current experts, the new type of lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, possibly even without symptoms.\nTransmission before the first symptoms are considered very rare. Thus, the first confirmed case of Coronavirus in Germany may also provide new insights into the pathways of infection of lung disease. Because the man was infected with the Chinese woman after initial knowledge, although at the time she showed no symptoms of the disease.\nThe authorities now want to gradually introduce further measures in Bavaria\nYeah. An official hotline of the Bavarian authorities was established, and some health insurance companies did so. Passengers at Munich Airport are required to see a doctor if they suspect an infection with the new Coronavirus, according to the information provided by the National Office with posters in three languages. Further escalation stages of the alert plan are possible: Currently, together with the federation, it is being discussed \"whether it might be useful to measure fever at airports,\" said Minister Huml. In view of the Coronavirus outbreak this year, the world's largest toy fair in Nuremberg is expecting fewer visitors from China.\nThere is no reason to panic, said Huml, as well as her colleague, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). The case shows \"that we are well prepared,\" he said. The risk to human health in Germany remains low, according to the Robert Koch Institute.\nDespite this, respiratory masks were sold out in individual pharmacies in Bavaria. He has heard this from companies in Lower Franconia and Munich, a spokesman for the Bavarian Pharmaceutical Association of the German Press Agency said.\nThe management of Webasto has cleared the staff at Stockdorfer Central for this week whether they want to come to the office or rather work at home. Webasto is a major supplier for the automotive industry with 13,400 employees and a turnover of 3,4 billion euro. The company had previously cancelled all business trips to China for the next two weeks. BMW, Audi and Siemens also stated that only strictly necessary business trips to China will take place.

China wants to investigate the death of a doctor who had warned of the new epidemic early on.\nThe number of infections in China increased by 3143 within one day. This confirmed 31.161 cases, according to the Beijing Health Commission on Friday. It was the second day in a row that no more new infections were reported than the day before. Within one day, however, 73 patients died of the new type of lung disease, as many as the day before. In China, there are 636 deaths.\nWhether a trend in infections can already be identified with the new figures is open, as statistics can also vary with the number of ongoing investigations. The course of the epidemic is difficult to predict from the perspective of the World Health Organisation (WHO). Apart from the areas particularly affected in Central China, the situation in China seems to be relatively stable at the moment, said WHO expert Michael Ryan in Geneva.\nAt the weekend the German government wants to bring back more Germans with some relatives from Wuhan. There are \"individuals\" who did not report to the airport until after the return flight last Saturday or did not make it to the airport in time, the Foreign Office said on Thursday evening. \"We are making an intensive effort to allow these people to leave as well.\"\nOverall, about 20 people are expected to come to Germany. Perhaps they can go out with a larger group of Brits. They are to be quarantined according to \"Mirrors\" in a clinic in Berlin-Copenhagen.\nThe fight against the Coronavirus could lead to a worldwide shortage of protective clothing\nYeah. \"We send tests, masks, gloves, respiratory protection and coats to all regions of the world, but the world is facing a chronic lack of personal protective equipment, as you might imagine,\" said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.\nAfter the death of Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, the Chinese government launched a politically sensitive investigation. The doctor had warned early of the outbreak of the new lung disease, but shortly afterwards was warned by the police and was not allowed to spread any more about it. The State Supervisory Commission sent an investigation team to Wuhan. It's about the \"questions of the people\" about the incidents.\nThe death of the 34-year-old ophthalmologist who had died of lung disease on Thursday evening has caused great sympathy. His fate symbolises for many the consequences of the cover-up and slow reaction of the authorities.\nChina's head of state and party Xi Jinping sees the fight against the spread of the new Coronavirus in a \"decisive phase\". In a phone call with US President Donald Trump, he expressed confidence that China would get the epidemic under control. The whole country was mobilised and took strict preventive measures. \"We are fully confident and able to defeat the epidemic.\" He criticised the US ban on Chinese and foreigners who were in China, with the exception of US citizens.\nOutside mainland China, over two dozen countries have confirmed 270 infections and two deaths. In Germany there was the 14th. Fall. The pathogen was detected in the wife of an infected Bavarian, as reported by the Bavarian Ministry of Health on Friday evening. Thus there are twelve cases in Bavaria, all related to the car supplier Webasto. There, employees of a colleague from China were infected.\nYeah. Two returnees from China were also tested positively.\nThe Art Basel Hong Kong, one of Asia's most prestigious art fairs, was cancelled. It should be with around 240 exhibitors of the 19. to 21. In March. Several factors, all of which were a consequence of the spread of the Coronavirus, led to the decision, the organiser MCH Group reported.\nTwo cruise ships with around 7000 passengers and crew members quarantined in Japan and Hong Kong due to viral incidents. Further 41 infections were detected at the Diamond Princess before Yokohama, as the Ministry of Health announced. This increased the number of infections on board to 61. According to new findings of the embassy, ten people of German nationality are on the ship, but among the infected are not Germans. More than 2000 passengers as well as 1045 crew members are expected to reach 19. Stay on board in February.\nAlso on the cruise ship in Hong Kong with more than 1800 passengers and 1800 crew members are under investigation. The virus had been detected in three passengers who had travelled with the World Dream in January. Since the ship had been stationed in Hong Kong three more times since, other 5000-passengers were invited to contact the authorities if they were not feeling well. Other infections were not known at first.\nIn Thailand, Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul reacted angrily to the situation of Western tourists, who reportedly refused to wear masks. \"They should be thrown out of Thailand for this behavior,\" he wagered in front of reporters on Friday. While Asian tourists were cooperative, European visitors did not wear masks and endangered their surroundings, Anutin said. He later apologized in a Facebook post for the outbreak. (dpa)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian airlines face “drastic” cuts in their planned growth because of the coronavirus crisis, an industry group warned, adding gloom to an already depleted Singapore Airshow as more companies scaled back plans on Monday.\nThe Singapore Airshow from Feb. 11 to 16 is proceeding, but the exhibition center is pockmarked with empty spaces that would have held displays from Chinese companies and others skipping the show because of the epidemic, which has killed more than 900 people.\nMore than 70 exhibitors, including major U.S. defense firms Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co have pulled out over concerns related to the new coronavirus.\nFew deals are expected at the biennial event, where the epidemic has triggered new safety measures and cast a shadow over airline profits and demand for airplanes.\nBefore the coronavirus hit, the International Air Transport Association had expected passenger numbers to rise by 4% in 2020 and cargo traffic to be 2% higher.\n“All bets are off in terms of traffic forecasts for this year,” Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines, said in an interview.\n“If you look at the schedule cuts and the actual operations they have been cut by 50%, 60%, 70% within China. It is pretty drastic,” he said.\nThe Pentagon reduced the size of its delegation to the air show, which had been set to include its chief weapons buyer, U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Ellen Lord, Reuters reported on Friday.\nSingapore on Friday raised its alert level for the coronavirus outbreak to orange, the same level reached during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory System (SARS) pandemic, sparking panic buying at supermarkets across the island.\nThere are 43 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Singapore\n. The orange alert level advises organizers to cancel or defer non-essential large-scale events and recommends precautions such as temperature screening and more frequent cleaning of common areas for those that do proceed.\nHealth experts, however, said they were concerned that temperature screening might not be effective, given reports the coronavirus could be spread by people without symptoms.\n“Temperature screening is okay to pick up people already sick - and those people should not be coming to the show anyway - but doesn’t pick up people incubating the virus,” said John McBride, an infectious disease physician and professor at Australia’s James Cook University.\nSIA Engineering Company Ltd and GE Aviation on Monday said they had postponed plans to hold a groundbreaking ceremony for a new engine overhaul facility in Singapore on Tuesday until further notice because of the raised alert level.\nSaudi Arabia’s General Authority for Military Industries withdrew from the show late Sunday, citing concerns associated with the coronavirus.\nThe air show’s organizers said on Sunday they were expecting more than 930 companies from 45 countries and 45,000 trade attendees - down from the 54,000 at the last show in 2018. They also plan to limit public attendance.\nThe lobbies of major hotels, usually bustling with attendees, were noticeably quiet.\nA spokeswoman for the organizers on Monday declined to provide an update on numbers and why the air show was going ahead when many smaller associated events and briefings were being canceled over coronavirus concerns.\nCancelling the show would lead to refunds running into the tens of millions of dollars, a source at one of the exhibitors told Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nOrganiser Experia Events, partly owned by ST Engineering and government agencies, charges at least S$1,550 per square meter for space in the show’s exhibition hall, according to its website\n.\nThat would equate to more than S$3 million  ($2.16 million) for ST Engineering’s booth, the show’s largest at more than 2,000 square meters.

Oil prices jumped on the reports.  \n Asked about the reports, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said: \"There are no known effective therapeutics against this 2019-nCoV (virus) and the WHO recommends enrolment into a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy and safety.\"  \n The process of developing and testing drugs or vaccines against a new pathogen normally takes many years and is often fraught with pitfalls and failures.  \n Even at the accelerated pace enabled by new technologies, the earliest that scientists hope to be able to start initial human trials of a new coronavirus vaccine is by June this year.  \n Doctors looking for ways to treat patients infected with the new coronavirus are likely to try antiviral medicines licensed for use against other viral infections to see if they might help, as well as potential antiviral drugs still in development.  \n The U.S. drugmaker Gilead says it has started clinical trials of patients in China infected with the new coronavirus, using an experimental drug called remdesivir, but stressed that this work is investigational at this stage.  \n \"It is not approved anywhere globally,\" a Gilead spokesman told Reuters in Beijing.  \n Gilead said it had increased manufacturing of remdesivir to create a stockpile that might be used in future viral disease outbreaks. \"We are doing this before knowing whether the drug is safe and effective to treat 2019-nCoV,\" the spokesman said.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON - Crude prices extended declines on Monday, dropping below $60 for the first time in nearly three months as the death toll from China's coronavirus rose and more businesses were forced to shut down, stoking expectations of slowing oil demand.  \n Brent crude <LCOc1> fell by $1.79 a barrel, or 2.95%, to $58.90 by 0903 GMT, its lowest since late October. Oil prices last fell below $60 on Nov. 1.  \n U.S. crude <CLc1> was down by $1.63, or 3%, at $52.55.  \n Global stock exchanges also fell as investors grew increasingly anxious about the widening crisis. Demand spiked for safe-haven assets, such as the Japanese yen and Treasury notes.[MKTS/GLOB]  \n Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud said on Monday that OPEC and allied global producers led by Russia can help to balance the oil markets in response to any demand changes.  \n He also said the Kingdom, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was watching developments in China and that he felt confident the new virus would be contained.  \n Markets are being \"primarily driven by psychological factors and extremely negative expectations adopted by some market participants despite (the virus') very limited impact on global oil demand,\" the minister said.  \n Prince Abdulaziz added that the outbreak of the SARS virus in 2002-2003 did not lead to a significant reduction in oil demand.  \n OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, have been withholding supply to support oil prices for nearly three years and on Jan. 1 increased their agreed output reduction by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.7 million bpd through March.  \n Prince Abdulaziz said on Friday the aim of OPEC+ was to cut seasonal inventory builds that typically occur in the first half of the year. All options would be open when OPEC+ meets in Vienna in March, he said\n.  \n Brent crude oil prices dropped by nearly 14% since a spike in tensions between the United States and Iran took prices to a closing high above $68 a barrel on Jan. 6.  \n The losses since are in spite of a fall in production from Libya by 75% to less than 300,000 barrels per day because of an ongoing blockade on oilfields.  \n \"Investor fears on oil demand have risen considerably, driven by unfavorable U.S. inventories and ... concerns on impact from the coronavirus outbreak,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Map showing places with confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B589312/coronavirus-map.jpg) REUTERS\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE - Four more cases of the coronavirus infection were confirmed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Feb 5), including the youngest patient confirmed so far, a six-month-old baby who is the child of an infected couple. \n Of the new cases, three are linked to the cluster of local transmissions announced on Tuesday, and one is an imported case involving a Chinese tourist from China's Wuhan city. \n On Tuesday, MOH announced six confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with four women here infected who had not travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak. \n These four cases are linked to a group of 20 tourists from Guangxi, China, that visited health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road in Lavender. With the cases announced on Wednesday, the number of cases linked to the tour group is now seven. \n MOH said the Chinese health authorities have confirmed that two travellers from the tour group have the coronavirus infection. \n It reiterated that there is no evidence of widespread community transmission in Singapore for now. \n Wednesday's announcement means that the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore is 28. \n All four new cases are in stable condition, while 22 cases confirmed earlier are stable or improving, and one case has been discharged, said MOH. \n The remaining case needs extra oxygen support, but is not in the intensive care unit. \n Outside China, Singapore has the second highest number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Japan has the most with 33 cases so far. \n The four new cases announced here on Wednesday include a father and son - a Singaporean man and his baby boy. His wife and their maid were earlier confirmed to be infected. The third new case is the Singaporean husband of an infected tour guide, while the fourth is a tourist from China\n. \n The father and son, as well as the husband of the tour guide, are among the seven confirmed cases linked to a tour group that visited the Yong Thai Hang shop. \n First case: The baby boy, who is Singaporean and six months old, is the son of a woman who works at Yong Thai Hang, which caters to Chinese tour groups. \n He is warded in an isolation room at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. \n MOH said the baby was not in any infant care facility before he was hospitalised - he was cared for at home. \n His 28-year-old mother is a Singapore permanent resident who did not recently travel to China. On Tuesday, MOH confirmed that she and their foreign domestic helper, a 44-year-old Indonesian woman, were infected with the coronavirus. \n This was after Yong Thai Hang was visited by a tour group from Guangxi on Jan 23. The Singaporean tour guide of the group was later confirmed to be infected. \n Second case: The baby's father was also one of the confirmed cases announced on Wednesday with no recent travel history to China. \n The 45-year-old Singaporean man is warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). \n Third case: Another case confirmed on Wednesday linked to the Chinese tour group that visited the shop is the husband of the group's infected tour guide. \n The 40-year-old Singaporean man also had not travelled to China recently, and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. \n He developed a fever on Jan 24 and visited Hougang Polyclinic with his wife, a 32-year-old Singaporean woman, on Jan 30. He went to NCID on Monday. \n Before the man was admitted to hospital, he was at his home in Buangkok Green and worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive which was visited by the same tour group from Guangxi. \n The man also visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and used public transport\n. \n MOH said that the risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low. \n Fourth case: The last confirmed case announced on Wednesday is a 42-year-old Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 21. \n She is the daughter of one of the earlier confirmed cases, a 73-year-old woman who is also a Chinese national. \n As the 42-year-old showed symptoms, she was taken by ambulance to NCID on the same day as her mother, immediately isolated, and is now warded in an isolation room at the centre. \n Regarding the tour group from Guangxi that visited the Yong Thai Hang shop, MOH said that the group was in Singapore from Jan 22 to 23, and also transited here for three hours on Jan 27 before leaving the country. \n The group also visited five other places here: Diamond Industries Jewellery Company in Harbour Drive; Meeting You Restaurant in Hamilton Road; Royal Dragon Restaurant in Havelock Road; T Galleria by DFS in Scotts Road; and D’Resort @ Downtown East in Pasir Ris. \n Almost 14 days have passed since the tourists visited these places, and MOH has communicated with 142 contacts. All of these contacts are well except for one who has been isolated as a suspected case. Test results for this person are pending. \n The ministry has also done contact tracing for the crew and passengers of the flight that left Singapore with the Chinese tour group on Jan 27. Five of them are still in Singapore and have been quarantined. \n The coronavirus, known as 2019-nCov, first emerged in Wuhan in December last year and has so far proven to be more infectious than 2003's severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). \n As of Wednesday, the outbreak has sickened more than 24,000 people and killed more than 490, with Hong Kong reporting its first death from the coronavirus on Tuesday, the second fatality outside mainland China. \n The deceased was a 39-year-old man with an underlying illness\n. He had taken the high-speed train from Hong Kong to Wuhan city in Hubei province on Jan 21, and from Changsha in Hunan province to Hong Kong on Jan 23. \n Most of the deaths from the virus occurred in central Hubei province. \n On Wednesday, three business travellers – a Malaysian and two South Koreans – linked to a conference at the Grand Hyatt Singapore they attended last month, were reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus. \n The two South Korean men had come into contact with the Malaysian, who was infected. Details on how, where and when the Malaysian man became infected were not revealed by MOH. \n The ministry said that this private business meeting at the hotel from Jan 20 to 22 involved 109 people from the same company. \n Of the 15 Singapore residents at this event, 11 are well. Four have reported symptoms and were referred to NCID for assessment. \n The event’s remaining 94 overseas participants have since left Singapore and MOH has informed the relevant health authorities abroad. \n In the wake of the outbreak, a growing number of countries, including Italy, the United States, Australia, Singapore, Japan and Russia, have put in place travel restrictions. Germany, France and the US have evacuated citizens from China. \n Several major airlines have also halted flights to and from China, deepening concerns of a widespread economic slowdown. \n In Singapore, measures to combat the outbreak include mask distribution at residents' committee centres and community centres islandwide, which began last Saturday. \n The Government announced on Jan 30 that all 1.3 million households in Singapore would be given a pack of four masks each amid reports of shops running out of stock. \n On Tuesday, it also said that large gatherings and communal activities, such as assemblies and excursions, will be suspended at schools, pre-schools and eldercare facilities here from Wednesday, after the first local transmissions of the coronavirus were reported\n. \n MOH said on Wednesday that 295 suspected cases have tested negative for the virus so far. Test results for 62 more cases are pending. \n The ministry has identified 379 close contacts of the confirmed cases. Of these, 304 are still in Singapore, with 299 contacted and being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are being made to contact the remaining five close contacts. \n MOH continues to advise Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. \n Members of the public should also observe good personal hygiene such as frequently washing their hands with soap. \n They should also wear a mask if they have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath, and seek medical attention promptly if they are feeling unwell. \n CLICK TO LISTEN TO ST'S HEALTH CHECK PODCAST\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Anxiety is creeping up as the virus which originated in Wuhan spreads around the world, showing no sign as yet of abating. \n Singapore is at code orange in its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition, a crisis management system drafted and refined after Singapore's experience of tackling the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003. \n It was at yellow for days before being raised to orange on Friday evening, after a few local cases emerged without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. \n Will it move to red, which would mean the virus is severe and spreading widely? \n From what is known publicly, the coronavirus appears to be more infectious than Sars, which hit Singapore in 2003 from March to May, infecting 238 and killing 33. \n Sars infected more than 8,000 people worldwide over several months, and killed about 774. \n However, the coronavirus appears less deadly, with a mortality rate of about 2 per cent, compared with Sars' 9.6 per cent. \n The Middle East respiratory syndrome virus in 2012 infected about 2,500 people worldwide but was deadlier, with a fatality rate of 34 per cent. \n With the coronavirus, as of yesterday, more than 34,000 have been infected since December, and more than 700 have died in China. \n In Singapore, there are 40 infected persons as of yesterday. \n Outside of Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, the mortality rate is only 0.2 per cent so far, while seasonal influenza has a death rate of 0.1 per cent. This makes the new virus much closer to influenza than Sars. \n Sars was spread by people after they developed symptoms like fever; 2019-nCoV, as the new virus is officially known, appears to be sneakier, and can spread from an infected person who shows no symptoms. \n This makes the coronavirus harder to detect and easier to spread. The odds of it spiralling out of control within the community are thus higher than with Sars\n. \n However, initial reports suggest that it does not make people as sick as Sars did. Some doctors are already predicting that this coronavirus may be more like influenza - many people could get infected with mild sickness; a small proportion (now 15 per cent) will get seriously sick but will recover; and a tiny fraction (now 2 per cent) may die. \n In May 2009, the H1N1 outbreak from the United States surged into Singapore. By the time it came under control in February 2010, 415,000 people here had been infected, and 420,000 had been vaccinated. \n In the end, 18 people here died of the H1N1 virus, which remains the dominant flu strain globally and in Singapore. It is highly infectious, but people have come to terms with living with it, as it has a low fatality rate of 0.02 per cent. \n Will the coronavirus turn out to be a highly infectious non-event? Or a fast-spreading virus that kills a large number in its wake? \n So far, several experts have predicted it will be the former. \n Meanwhile, China is patenting a drug found to be highly effective in treating the disease. Many labs around the world are also vying to be the first to develop a vaccine. \n Singaporeans should educate and update themselves on the virus so that they can make rational, sensible choices for themselves and their families. \n In Singapore, it is clear that political leaders are trying to prepare Singaporeans for the long haul. No one can predict for sure how this virus outbreak will pan out. But the experience of Sars gives some pointers. \n I am the author of a book on Sars. Titled A Defining Moment: How Singapore Beat Sars, it was published in 2004, and it details Singapore's whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach to battling the virus. (The book is out of print, but can be borrowed from the National Library.) \n Drawing from what we went through with Sars, we can better prepare ourselves for the long battle against the coronavirus\n. \n One key takeaway from that experience is that when there is wide community spread, the battle against the virus will be as much about mindsets as it is about medicine. \n The psychological aspect came to the fore over the weekend, as many people in Singapore, young and old, stripped supermarket shelves of essentials like noodles, rice and even toilet paper, in a frenzy of stockpiling. This was despite assurances from government leaders and retailers that there are stocks aplenty in warehouses. \n Singapore is a small, close-knit society, and prone to the herd mentality and mass behaviour. \n Social psychology tells us that in times of anxiety, people tend to conform and follow what others are doing. (\"My neighbours are stocking up on food; they know something I don't, so I am going to do the same.\") \n They also start to worry for themselves and their loved ones. (\"Everyone else is stocking up; there won't be any left for me and my family; I am going out to grab my share.\") \n The best way to stop such thinking is to be rational. (\"How many packs of rice do I need? Are rice imports going to stop? Will there be rice stocks next week?\") \n And then be deliberately pro-social and think of others. (\"Do I really need all these alcohol swabs now? What if I buy the last pack of swabs and deprive a sick person who needs it for his daily injection?\") \n Individual actions have collective impact. We are all in this virus outbreak together, and we stand or fall together. \n Right now, most of us still go about our daily lives sans mask, gloves or protective clothing, albeit with more attention to hand washing with soap and water, using hand sanitiser and avoiding touching our faces - infection control tips 101. \n But the mood can shift quickly, and we can become a city ruled by fear of strangers and public spaces. \n For example, about 30,000 workers from China have yet to return to Singapore from their Chinese New Year leave\n. There is a risk of infections going up when they return. \n As concerns about community spread widen, more people can be expected to take precautions to protect their loved ones and themselves, by donning protective gear or avoiding crowded spaces. \n With Sars, once the virus spread, people started fearing being around others, not knowing who might be infected. \n They then reacted by shunning those at risk. Many also stayed home, away from shops and eateries, causing businesses to suffer. It took concerted action to shift Singaporeans' mindsets. \n The Sars experience reminds us that the battle against the virus is fought on two fronts: medical and psychological. \n The medical battle has to do with screening, public hygiene, infection control, diagnosis, treatment of patients, and the race to develop quicker diagnostic tools, better treatment protocols or a vaccine. \n The psychological war is about overcoming fear, prejudice and paranoia. \n From Sars, we know there are three fronts in the psychological battle. \n We must guard against ostracising healthcare workers, who are at the forefront of the fight against the virus. \n As the virus spreads widely, more people will be infected and need care. This means healthcare workers will be at greater risk. \n During Sars, some Singaporeans reacted by shunning them. This is already happening again. Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam noted in a Facebook post on Friday that he had heard anecdotally about cases of abuse directed at healthcare workers. \n Nurses have taken to Facebook to share anecdotes of how they were ostracised on the MRT and scolded for wearing their uniforms onto the train as fellow travellers feared they were spreading germs. \n This prompted commenters to express support for the nurses, with one post saying: \"If you think the nurses and doctors carry lots of germs or if you think that we are dirty, please get your family to nurse you when you are hospitalised\n.\" \n A young nurse I featured in the Sars book described how, after working hard all day to treat patients at \"Sars central\" in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), she would find herself shunned on the MRT because of her nurse's uniform; neighbours refused to share a lift with her, or shut their windows as she walked past their flats. \n She said with a frown: \"It made me really angry. Here we were, trying our best to fight for our patients. If we were not there in the Sars wards, who would be there for them?\" \n Others complained that buses and cabs, and even pizza delivery staff, refused to call at TTSH stops. \n The issue was made public by ministers, who urged Singaporeans to change their mindsets. \n Within days, people responded. About 500,000 peach ribbons were made and worn by members of the public to support healthcare workers. TTSH received sachets of herbal lozenges for their staff; anonymous donors sent 60 crates of Fuji apples and 1,000 stalks of gerberas. A fund to salute healthcare workers, called The Courage Fund, raised $28.5 million, and fund administrators had to ask the public to stop giving to it. \n The change motivated healthcare workers and created a more positive atmosphere nationwide. \n This time round, I hope Singaporeans will avoid the shunning and abusive stage and go straight to the stage of appreciating our front-line soldiers in the fight against the virus. \n Of those who died during Sars, about 40 per cent were healthcare workers. They put their lives on the line to care for those infected. They are heroes. They deserve our support and appreciation, not our fear and discrimination. \n Words, thoughtful acts, practical or heartfelt tokens and social media tributes can all make a difference in rallying our healthcare troops. \n The second front in the psychological war is in business. \n As the virus spreads and fear rises, the temptation to hunker down and stay home will prove irresistible. But this will affect businesses badly\n. A shutdown will only harm our own society. \n During Sars, Singaporeans went into panic lockdown mode for a few weeks. The mood seemed darkest in late March and early April, four weeks into the outbreak. \n In April came news that the virus had spread to the Singapore General Hospital, and then beyond hospitals, to a wholesale market. \n But the mood suddenly shifted in the second half of April, and people started coming out to shop. \n Clothing retailer Zara's opening on April 23 at Liat Towers attracted hundreds. Best Denki's $99 offer of a bar fridge at its new Bishan Junction 8 outlet drew a queue of 200 by opening time. Concerts went ahead. Pubs and nightspots reported a surge in business. \n \"It was almost as though the Sars-induced fear had a life of its own - its own incubation period, and its own life cycle. It was as though, after being cooped up for weeks, Singaporeans decided enough was enough and ventured out,\" I wrote in the book. \n What shifted the mood were deliberate campaigns to boost consumer confidence, bolstered by savvy sales promotions (like the $99 fridge). \n One important initiative was the Cool Singapore programme to provide a Sars-free corridor for tourists and shoppers by ensuring that places like the airport, taxis, hotels, shopping malls and restaurants were Sars-free. \n This was done by introducing regular temperature checks and screening measures at these places. Establishments that met criteria for such screening were audited and certified fever-free to assure shoppers. \n The programme was effective, as no case of Sars surfaced at these establishments, since staff with fever were quickly identified and isolated. It also sent a message to the world that Singapore had Sars under control. \n If Sars was any guide, people will hunker down first, then bounce back to business as usual if they feel safe and if deals are attractive enough\n. Reassurances of safety should thus be matched by concrete action like a programme to audit and certify retail joints. \n The third front in the psychological battle against the virus lies in our own hearts and mindsets. \n It is too easy to blame the victim and lash out with anti-China or anti-Chinese sentiments, as is happening worldwide. In the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, Denmark and a host of other countries, some people and media reports are targeting people from China, people who are ethnic Chinese or people who look East Asian for abuse because of the virus. \n In Singapore, where the majority population is ethnic Chinese, we must not succumb to such racism or xenophobia. We must remember that foreigners are not the culprits; indeed, about one-third of our healthcare workforce, who are risking their lives to fight the virus, are foreign. \n China, meanwhile, is putting up a valiant fight to contain the virus, after an initial state of denial. As many have noted, locking down Wuhan and its surrounds to contain the virus was tantamount to sacrificing a province to save the rest of China and the world. \n After interviewing scores of people for the Sars book, including patients, nurses, doctors, hospital chiefs, civil servants and government ministers, I came away convinced that the much-criticised Singapore nanny state is impressive in action. \n Government authorities nagged about hygiene, cajoled shoppers onto the streets, and enforced quarantine orders. \n The state and its apparatus of community organisations, unions, business groups, religious groups, media organisations and grassroots bodies worked together to trace contacts and deliver timely information, thermometers and food to the quarantined and consolation to the isolated. \n Each night, a press conference helmed by ministers debunked rumours, keeping the information flow open and smooth\n. \n Today, 17 years later, the Singapore Government should be better prepared than in 2003 to lead the fight against the new coronavirus. Meanwhile, our healthcare workers are highly trained and brave. \n It remains for us, as individuals, to realise that what we each do makes a huge collective difference. \n Take responsibility for personal hygiene. Wash hands. Avoid touching your face. Observe leave of absence and quarantine rules. Mask up if unwell and seek medical attention. \n Act responsibly and avoid panic behaviour like stockpiling food, masks or protective equipment. Doing so increases the chance of shortages for people who genuinely need the items. \n Do not shun or shame but be kind to all, including the infected, the quarantined, healthcare workers and those from China. \n Most of all, do not give in to paranoia or fear. Keep calm and carry on. Because we are in it together.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "随着起源于武汉的病毒在世界各地传播，焦虑情绪也在逐渐蔓延，目前还没有迹象表明正在消退。\n新加坡的疾病爆发应对系统状况正处于橙色代码状态，这是继2003年新加坡应对严重急性呼吸系统综合症（Sars）爆发的经验之后起草和完善的危机管理系统。\n几天来一直是黄色，直到周五晚上被提升为橙色，此前出现了一些与以往病例或到中国旅行历史没有任何联系的当地病例。\n它会变成红色吗？红色意味着病毒很严重，而且传播范围很广？\n据公开所知，冠状病毒似乎比2003年3月至5月袭击新加坡的非典更具传染性，共感染238人，造成33人死亡。\n在过去的几个月里，Sars在全球范围内感染了8000多人，导致774人死亡。\n然而，冠状病毒的致死率似乎较低，与Sars的9.6%相比，其死亡率约为2%。\n2012年，中东呼吸综合征病毒感染了全球约2500人，但死亡人数更高，病死率为34%。\n随着冠状病毒的传播，截至昨天，自去年12月以来，中国已经有34000多人感染冠状病毒，700多人死亡。\n截至昨日，新加坡共有40名感染者。\n在武汉所在的湖北省外，目前死亡率仅为0.2%，而季节性流感的死亡率为0.1%。这使得新病毒比Sars更接近流感。\n非典型肺炎是在人们出现发烧等症状后传播的；2019年的nCoV，正如官方所知，似乎更狡猾，可以从没有任何症状的感染者身上传播。\n这使得冠状病毒更难检测，更容易传播。因此，它在社区内失控的几率比非典高\n.\n然而，最初的报告显示，它并不像Sars那样让人生病。一些医生已经预测，这种冠状病毒可能更像流感——许多人可能会感染轻微疾病；一小部分人（现在是15%）会重病但会康复；一小部分人（现在是2%）可能会死亡。\n2009年5月，从美国爆发的H1N1疫情涌入新加坡。到2010年2月控制时，这里已有41.5万人感染，42万人接种了疫苗。\n最终，这里有18人死于H1N1病毒，而H1N1病毒仍然是全球和新加坡的主要流感病毒株。它具有很强的传染性，但人们已经接受了与它一起生活，因为它的死亡率很低，只有0.02%。\n冠状病毒会变成一种高度传染性的非事件吗？或者是一种快速传播的病毒，在它之后杀死了大量的人？\n到目前为止，有几位专家预测这将是前者。\n与此同时，中国正在申请一种治疗该病的高效药物的专利。世界各地的许多实验室也在争先恐后地开发疫苗。\n新加坡人应该对自己进行有关病毒的教育和更新，以便为自己和家人做出理性、明智的选择。\n在新加坡，很明显，政治领导人正试图让新加坡人做好长期准备。没有人能确切预测这次病毒爆发的结果。但非典的经历给了我们一些启示。\n我是一本关于非典的书的作者。2004年出版的《决定性时刻：新加坡如何战胜非典》一书详细介绍了新加坡政府和全社会抗击非典的方法。（这本书已绝版，但可以从国家图书馆借阅。）\n从我们经历的非典中，我们可以更好地为对抗冠状病毒的长期斗争做好准备\n.\n这一经历的一个重要收获是，当社区广泛传播时，与病毒的斗争将与医学一样，更多的是关于心态。\n心理方面的问题在上周末凸显出来，因为新加坡许多人，无论老少，都疯狂地囤积着超市货架上的面条、大米甚至厕纸等必需品。尽管政府领导人和零售商保证仓库里有大量存货，但情况还是如此。\n新加坡是一个小而紧密的社会，容易产生从众心理和群体行为。\n社会心理学告诉我们，在焦虑的时候，人们倾向于遵从别人的行为。（“我的邻居正在囤积食物；他们知道一些我不知道的事情，所以我也要这样做。”）\n他们也开始为自己和亲人担心。（“其他人都在囤货，我和我的家人将一无所有；我要出去抢我的份额。”）\n停止这种想法的最好办法是保持理性。（“我需要多少包米饭？大米进口会停止吗？下周会有大米库存吗？”）\n然后故意亲社会，考虑别人。（“我现在真的需要这些酒精拭子吗？如果我买了最后一包棉签，剥夺了病人每天注射所需的棉签怎么办？”）\n个人行为具有集体影响。我们都是一起在这病毒爆发，我们站在一起或跌倒在一起。\n现在，我们大多数人仍然在日常生活中不戴口罩，不戴手套，不穿防护服，尽管更注意用肥皂和水洗手，使用洗手液，避免触摸我们的脸-感染控制技巧101。\n但这种情绪会很快转变，我们可以成为一个由对陌生人和公共场所的恐惧所统治的城市。\n例如，约有3万名来自中国的工人尚未从春节假期返回新加坡\n. 当他们回来的时候，感染的风险会上升。\n随着人们对社区的担忧越来越大，可以期望更多的人采取预防措施，通过穿上防护服或避开拥挤的空间来保护他们的亲人和自己。\n非典病毒一旦传播，人们开始害怕与他人在一起，不知道谁可能被感染。\n然后他们做出反应，避开那些有风险的人。许多人还呆在家里，远离商店和餐馆，使企业蒙受损失。它采取了一致行动来改变新加坡人的心态。\n非典的经历提醒我们，抗击非典的斗争有两条战线：医学和心理学。\n这场医疗战与筛查、公共卫生、感染控制、诊断、患者治疗以及开发更快的诊断工具、更好的治疗方案或疫苗的竞赛有关。\n心理战是关于克服恐惧、偏见和偏执。\n从非典看，心理战有三条战线。\n我们必须防止排斥卫生保健工作者，他们是对抗病毒的最前线。\n随着病毒的广泛传播，会有更多的人受到感染，需要护理。这意味着医护人员将面临更大的风险。\n非典期间，一些新加坡人对此避而不见。这已经在发生了。内政部长尚穆加姆（K.Shanmugam）周五在Facebook上发表的一篇文章中指出，他听到了一些针对医护人员的虐待案例。\n护士们在Facebook上分享了他们在捷运上被排斥的趣闻轶事，并因穿着制服上火车而受到责骂，因为同行担心他们在传播病菌。\n这促使评论人士对这些护士表示支持，其中一个帖子说：“如果你认为护士和医生携带大量病菌，或者你认为我们是肮脏的，请让你的家人在你住院时护理你。”\n.\"\n我在《非典》一书中介绍了一位年轻的护士，她在谭托克生医院（TTSH）的“非典中心”为治疗病人辛苦工作了一整天之后，发现自己在捷运上因为护士的制服而被拒之门外；邻居们拒绝和她搭车，或者在她走过公寓时关上窗户。\n她皱着眉头说：“这让我很生气。我们在这里，尽力为我们的病人而战。如果我们不在非典病区，谁会在那里？”\n其他人则抱怨公交车和出租车，甚至披萨递送员，都拒绝在TTSH车站打电话。\n部长们公开了这一问题，敦促新加坡人改变心态。\n几天之内，人们做出了回应。大约50万条桃丝带由公众制作和佩戴，以支持医疗工作者。TTSH为他们的工作人员收到了几袋草药含片；匿名捐赠者送来了60箱富士苹果和1000根非洲菊茎。一项名为“勇气基金”（勇气基金）的向医护人员致敬的基金募集了2850万美元，基金管理人不得不要求公众停止向它捐款。\n这一变化激励了医疗工作者，并在全国范围内营造了一种更加积极的氛围。\n这一次，我希望新加坡人能避开回避和辱骂的阶段，直接走到欣赏我们抗击病毒前线士兵的阶段。\n在非典期间死亡的人中，约40%是医护人员。他们冒着生命危险去照顾那些感染者。他们是英雄。他们应该得到我们的支持和赞赏，而不是我们的恐惧和歧视。\n言语、深思熟虑的行为、实用或真挚的信物以及社交媒体的悼念，都能在凝聚我们的医疗队伍方面起到作用。\n心理战的第二条战线是商业。\n随着病毒的传播和恐惧感的上升，蹲下来呆在家里的诱惑将被证明是不可抗拒的。但这将严重影响企业\n. 停产只会损害我们自己的社会。\n非典期间，新加坡人进入恐慌封锁状态达数周之久。在疫情爆发四周后的三月底和四月初，人们的情绪似乎最为黑暗。\n今年4月，有消息称，病毒已经扩散到新加坡总医院，然后在医院之外，扩散到一个批发市场。\n但4月下旬，人们的情绪突然发生了变化，人们开始出来购物。\n服装零售商Zara 4月23日在Liat Towers的开业吸引了数百人。贝斯特登基（Best Denki）在其新的璧山8号交叉口（Bishan Junction 8 outlet）以99美元的价格提供一台酒吧冰箱，开张时间排起了200人的长队。音乐会继续进行。酒吧和夜总会报告生意激增。\n“几乎就好像非典引发的恐惧有它自己的生命——它自己的潜伏期和生命周期。我在书中写道：“就好像，在被关了几个星期之后，新加坡人觉得足够了，就冒险出去了。”。\n改变这种情绪的是精心策划的旨在提振消费者信心的活动，而精明的促销活动（如售价99美元的冰箱）则起到了推波助澜的作用。\n一个重要的倡议是“酷新加坡”计划，通过确保机场、出租车、酒店、购物商场和餐馆等地方无传染性非典型肺炎，为游客和购物者提供无传染性的走廊。\n这是通过在这些地方引入定期温度检查和筛选措施来实现的。对符合筛选标准的机构进行了审计，并证明其不发烧，以保证购物者。\n该方案是有效的，因为这些机构没有出现非典病例，因为发烧的工作人员很快被发现并隔离。它还向世界传递了一个信息，即新加坡已控制住非典。\n如果“非典”是一个导火索，人们会先蜷缩起来，如果感觉安全，如果交易足够吸引人，就会像往常一样恢复正常\n. 因此，安全保证应与具体行动相匹配，如审计和认证零售店的计划。\n对抗病毒心理战的第三条战线在于我们自己的内心和心态。\n像全世界正在发生的那样，指责受害者和抨击反华或反华情绪太容易了。在美国、加拿大、新西兰、澳大利亚、法国、丹麦等一系列国家，一些人和媒体的报道把矛头对准了中国人、华裔或因病毒而被东亚人虐待的人。\n在新加坡，大多数人口是华裔，我们决不能屈从于这种种族主义或仇外心理。我们必须记住，外国人不是罪魁祸首；事实上，约三分之一冒着生命危险抗击病毒的医疗工作者是外国人。\n与此同时，在最初的否认之后，中国正在进行一场遏制病毒的英勇斗争。正如许多人所指出的，封锁武汉及其周边地区以控制病毒，等于牺牲一个省来拯救中国其他地区和世界。\n在采访了许多人，包括病人、护士、医生、医院院长、公务员和政府部长等，之后，我确信，备受批评的新加坡保姆国家在行动中令人印象深刻。\n政府当局唠叨卫生问题，哄骗购物者上街，执行隔离令。\n国家及其由社区组织、工会、商业团体、宗教团体、媒体组织和基层机构组成的机构共同努力，追踪接触，及时向被隔离者提供信息、温度计和食物，并向被隔离者提供安慰。\n每晚，由部长们主持的新闻发布会都会揭穿谣言，保持信息畅通\n.\n17年后的今天，新加坡政府应该比2003年做好准备，领导抗击新冠状病毒的斗争。同时，我们的医护人员训练有素，勇敢无畏。\n作为个人，我们仍然需要认识到，我们每个人的所作所为都会带来巨大的集体差异。\n负责个人卫生。洗手。不要碰你的脸。遵守休假和检疫规定。如果身体不适，请戴上口罩并就医。\n负责任地行动，避免恐慌行为，如储存食物、口罩或防护设备。这样做增加了真正需要这些物品的人短缺的机会。\n不要逃避或羞辱，要善待所有人，包括受感染者、被隔离者、医护人员和来自中国的人。\n最重要的是，不要屈服于偏执或恐惧。保持冷静，继续前进。因为我们在一起。\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "GENEVA (AFP) - Keen to avoid stigmatising the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, or Chinese people, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is treading carefully on naming the new coronavirus. \n The UN health agency's official temporary name for the disease, which it has designated as a global health emergency, is \"2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease\". \n The date refers to when it was first identified on Dec 31, 2019 and \"nCoV\" stands for \"novel coronavirus\" - the family of viruses it belongs to. \n \"We thought it was very important that we provide an interim name so that no location was associated with the name,\" Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's Emerging Diseases unit, told the agency's executive board on Friday (Feb 7). \n \"I'm sure you've all seen many media reports that are still calling it using Wuhan or China and we wanted to ensure that there was no stigma,\" she said. \n The final decision on a name is expected within days and is up to the WHO itself as well as coronavirus experts on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). \n But picking a more specific name is fraught with dangers. \n Under a set of guidelines issued in 2015, WHO advises against using place names such as Ebola and Zika - where those diseases were first identified and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public imagination. \n Dr Sylvie Briand, head of WHO's Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, said this week that the use of a place name created \"an unnecessary burden\". \n More general names such as \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" or \"Spanish flu\" are also to be avoided as they can stigmatise entire regions or ethnic groups\n. \n \"It is the responsibility of us all to ensure that there is no stigma associated with this disease, and the unnecessary and unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable,\" said Dr Michael Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. \n The WHO also points out that using animal species in the name can create confusion such as H1N1, which was popularly referred to as \"swine flu\". \n This had a major effect for the pork industry even though the disease was being spread by people rather than pigs. \n H1N1 was also sometimes also called Mexican flu \"which was not very nice for Mexican people,\" Dr Briand said. \n People's names - usually the scientists who identified the disease - are also banned, as are \"terms that incite undue fear\" such as \"unknown\" or \"fatal\", the WHO said. \n \"We've seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals,\" the WHO said in its guidelines. \n Instead, it recommended that any new name should be descriptive and include the causative pathogen if known, as well as being short and easy to pronounce. \n \"We are really trying to be as neutral as possible, but as helpful as possible as well, because we need to name things with the same name everywhere in the world if we want to tackle the enemy in the same way,\" Dr Briand said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The number of deaths caused by the new coronavirus in Wuhei province, where the city of Wuhan, epicenter of the virus, rose this Thursday to 204. This new data increases the total number of deaths worldwide to 212. According to the Wuhei health authorities, the number of infected people in Chinese territory has also increased to 5806, aggregating 9320 cases of infection worldwide. 98 There are confirmed cases of infection outside China in at least 18 countries. There was also confirmation that the virus has already reached all Chinese provinces, including Tibet.\nThis Thursday, at least 6000 people were detained inside a cruise ship off Italy because they suspected that a couple might be infected with the new coronavirus, reported to Reuters. On suspicion were two passengers arriving from Macao to board the Smeralda Coast, which was docked at the port of Savona, and presenting flu-like symptoms. However, it confirmed the Italian Government at the beginning of the evening that the tests on the couple were negative.\nAlthough no case was detected on the cruise ship, Italy confirmed two cases on Thursday in the new coronavirus country and suspended all flights to or from China despite opposition to the restrictions on flights from the World Health Organisation (WHO). \"As in other countries, we have two confirmed cases of the new coronavirus. These are two Chinese tourists who arrived a few days ago [Italy],\"said the Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, quoted by the agency France-Presse, adding that the decision to close the Italian airspace to flights\"to and from\"to China was\"as a precaution\".\nItaly is the fourth European country to confirm cases of viral infection after France, Germany and Finland\nYeah. The new coronavirus has reached at least 18 countries in addition to China, including India and the Philippines, which have recorded the first cases in the last few hours.\nThe new coronavirus has also arrived in India: there is at least one positive case detected in the state of Kerala, according to a statement from the Indian health authorities. The Philippines has also confirmed its first case.\nIn both cases, infected people had travelled from the Wuhan province, the epicenter of the outbreak. In the Filipino case, the infected woman is 38-year-old and of Chinese origin. In the Indian case, the infected student was studying at the University of Wuhan, although it is not known when he returned from China to India. The student is currently under quarantine.\nAccording to the Indian Ministry of Health, all hospitals and health centers are prepared for a possible outbreak and airports are monitoring symptoms (such a s fever, cough or breathing difficulties) in all incoming passengers. The Indian Government is also planning two flights to repatriate citizens in Hubei Province, China. Only those citizens who are healthy will be transported.\nIt is not the only country to choose to repatriate its citizens. Japan and the US have already sent chartered flights to China in order to withdraw nationals from their countries. Australia is preparing to do the same and has already announced that the rescued nationals will be isolated on Christmas Island in quarantine. The arrival of planes from South Korea and the United Kingdom was delayed by the lack of authorisation from the Chinese authorities, writes The Guardian.\nIn Europe, the second Hi fly chartered flight to repatriate 350 people from several European states left Beja Airport at 10am this Thursday. This flight is expected to bring back the 17 Portuguese who have asked to leave China\nYeah. Italy and Germany also independently announced two flights\nIn response to the outbreak, Russia has chosen to close its border with China, reporting the South China Morning Post. Nor will any electronic visas be issued to Chinese nationals wishing to visit Russia from this Thursday.\n\"We must do everything to protect our population,\" said Prime Minister Mishustin, who also advises that all trips to China should be avoided.\nThe Macao Government also decided this Thursday to postpone the resumption of the lessons. The new date will be announced one week before the reopening of \"higher and non-higher education institutions (secondary, primary and child education) and the resumption of activities in the\"private complementary educational support centres and in continuing education institutions\".\nWithout giving a date, Kong Ngai, head of the education department in the semi-autonomous region of China, added that during suspension schools must \"use remote means\" to work and accompany students. Even cross-border pupils \"do not need to go to Macao\" and \"should stay home until school starts again\". Schools should \"cooperate\" with the Government of Macao and avoid crowding people and reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.\nOn the other hand, Macao's health authorities have stated that the most recent cases of coronavirus in Zhuhai are people who have been in the territory and the routes of these patients are being checked. According to the Chinese National Health Commission, 26 confirmed cases of infection with the new coronavirus have been confirmed to date. Zhuhai is located in Guangdong Province (South China), the second with the largest number of cases in the country: 354\nYeah.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) decided this Thursday to classify the coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international interest, the most important signal the WHO can give the world. In order to declare a public health emergency of international interest (PHEIC) the situation under examination must meet three criteria: it must be an extraordinary event, with a risk of high public health risk from other countries and requiring a coordinated international response. This is the sixth time that the WHO has used this global alert instrument.\n\"In recent days the spread of the virus, especially in some countries and especially by the transmission of humans-to-humans, is worrying us,\" said the Director-General of OMS Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday, quoted by the BBC. In Germany, Vietnam and Japan, there are reports of people who have become infected without ever travelling to China: only by contact with other infected people. \"Even though the numbers outside China are relatively small, they have the potential to cause a much larger outbreak,\" he added.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAccording to a study published in the scientific journal The Lancet, which analyses at least 99 cases of the new coronavirus treated at Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan between 1 and 20 in January, at least 46 people had been on the Wuhan fish market. The average age of the infected is 55,5 years and most of them were male. The most common symptoms are fever and cough. At least 11 of the infected in this hospital died from organ failure. Researchers concluded that the infection affects older men more with other previous medical problems.\nWith Sofia Neves\n",

The meeting shall take place at the headquarters of the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland.\nThis Wednesday, China elevated to 132 dead and more than 5.900 infected the balance of the new coronavirus detected in December in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, in the center of the country.\nIn addition to mainland China, cases of infection have also been reported in Macao, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Vietnam, Nepal, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Finland.\nAn international public health emergency requires the adoption of worldwide prevention and coordination measures.\nTo state this, the WHO considers three criteria: an extraordinary situation, a risk of rapid expansion to other countries and a coordinated international response.\nAccording to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, although most of the infections occurred in China, with only 68 confirmed cases in other 15 countries, an inter-human transmission was recorded outside China (Germany, Vietnam and Japan)\nYeah.\n\"Although the figures outside China are still relatively low, they are likely to give rise to a much larger epidemic\", he said at a press conference at the WHO headquarters.\nAccording to the Director General of WHO, most infected people have \"mild symptoms\", but one in five suffers from a serious illness such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.\n\"The whole world must be on alert, the whole world must act,\" stated the director of the WHO emergency programs, Michael Ryan, in Geneva.\nOn Sunday, the Director-General of WHO visited China, where he met with government representatives and health experts.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this Wednesday that he had \"frank meetings\" with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, who put into practice \"a monumental national response\".\nOn Tuesday, the WHO announced the dispatch of international experts to China.\nThe international public health emergency was declared for the epidemics of influenza H1N1 in 2009 of the Zika virus in 2016, polio in 2014, and Ebola, which struck part of West Africa, from 2014 to 2016, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018.\nThe number of cases of infection with the new coronavirus, provisionally designated by the WHO as \"2019-nCoV\", exceeds the number of infections recorded with the epidemic of Acute Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by another coronavirus, but also detected in China and spread to other countries in 2002 and 2003.\nSARS infected five.327 people in China and provoked 774 deaths in the world, including 349 in mainland China.\n",

Permission to dock refused,” Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said in a Facebook post.\nThai Deputy Transport Minister Atirat Ratanasate said in a separate Facebook post that, while the ship would not be allowed to dock, Thailand “will gladly help providing fuel, medicine, and food” to the ship.\nThe coronavirus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last month has caused chaos in Asia and beyond with many flights suspended, businesses disrupted and entry restrictions imposed by governments trying to ward off the spread.\nAnother cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, with 3,700 passengers and crew onboard, is quarantined in the Japanese port of Yokohama, with 135 cases of coronavirus detected on the Carnival Corp-owned vessel.\nThe World Dream cruise ship was held up in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong for days after it was linked to three cases but all passengers and crew later tested negative and were allowed to disembark.\nThe virus has killed more than 1,000 people - all but two in China - and infected more than 40,000, most in China but including 319 cases in 24 other countries and territories.\nThe Westerdam had already been turned away from several ports, including in Japan, Taiwan, Guam and the Philippines, amid fears of the virus.\nAccording to a World Health Organization (WHO) statement, Thai officials have said health authorities there may board the ship to conduct health checks on passengers first before granting permission to disembark.\nHolland America says no one on board has the virus. Media reports say it carries 1,455 passengers and 802 crew; its original destination was Yokohama, Japan, which refused it permission to dock.\n“The ship is not in quarantine and we have no reason to believe there are any cases of coronavirus on board despite media reports,” the company said.\nIt had earlier said the Westerdam was sailing towards Bangkok, and it is not immediately clear whether the ship would change course.\nHolland America said it was aware of reports that Thailand planned to refuse permission for the Westerdam to dock there and was “actively working” on the matter.\n“We know this is confusing for our guests and their families and we greatly appreciate their patience,” the company said in a statement.\nSome passengers on board the ship said they had not been told that the ship would be unable to dock in Thailand.\n“(We) thought is was all finalised. Everyone has rebooked flights yet again! Now we are back in limbo,” passenger Stephen Hansen told Reuters by email.\nAmerican tourist Angela Jones said passengers had been getting regular temperature checks but were becoming frustrated with the uncertainty.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak is hitting a peak in China this month and may be over by April, the government’s senior medical adviser said on Tuesday, in the latest assessment of an epidemic that has rattled the world.\nIn an interview with Reuters, Zhong Nanshan, an 83-year-old epidemiologist who won fame for combating the SARS epidemic in 2003, shed tears about the doctor Li Wenliang who died last week after being reprimanded for raising the alarm.\nBut Zhong was optimistic the new outbreak would soon slow, with the number of new cases already declining in some places.\nThe peak should come in middle or late February, followed by a plateau and decrease, Zhong said, basing the forecast on mathematical modelling, recent events and government action.\n“I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,” he said in a hospital run by Guangzhou Medical University, where 11 coronavirus patients were being treated.\nThough his comments may soothe some global anxiety over the coronavirus - which has killed more than 1,000 people and seen more than 40,000 cases, almost all in China - Zhong’s previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature.\n“We don’t know why it’s so contagious, so that’s a big problem,” added Zhong, who helped identify flaws in China’s emergency response systems during the 2002-03 SARS crisis.\nHe said there was a gradual reduction in new cases in the southern province of Guangdong where he is based, and also in Zhejiang and elsewhere. “So that’s good news for us.”\nWith China taking unprecedented measures to seal infected regions and limit transmission routes, Zhong applauded the government for locking down Wuhan, the city at the epicentre which he said lost control of the virus at an early stage.\n“The local government, local healthcare authority should have some responsibility on this,” he said.\n“Their work had not been done well.”\nThe virus is believed to have originated in early December in a Wuhan seafood market where wildlife was illegally sold.\nLocal authorities have also come under fire for their heavy-handed treatment of the late doctor Li, who was reprimanded by police in early January for “spreading rumours” about the disease before becoming its best-known fatality last Friday.\n“The majority of the people think he’s the hero of China,” Zhong said, wiping tears. “I’m so proud of him, he told people the truth, at the end of December, and then he passed away.”\nBehind him stood hundreds of other doctors all wanting to tell the truth and now being encouraged by the government to do so, he said. “We really need to listen,” he said.\nThe virus has now infected more than 40,000 people on the Chinese mainland and spread to at least 24 countries.\nZhong, who said the government’s unwillingness to share information prolonged the SARS crisis, said Beijing had done much better this time on issues like transparency and cooperating with the World Health Organization (WHO).\nBut more should be done, he said, including an end to wildlife trade, better international cooperation on hygiene technology, improved operation of disease control centres, and a global “sentry” system to warn of potential epidemics.\n“If we have better cooperation and coordination, we can find it earlier and figure out the human-to-human transmission earlier,” he said during the roughly 90-minute interview, adding that the outbreak would not be quite so serious if such a system was in place.\nZhong said uncertainties remained about how the coronavirus was infecting patients, if it can spread via faeces and whether so-called “superspreaders” were helping transmit the disease.\nSo far, China’s data shows the recovery rate to be quite low, with less than 10% of confirmed patients discharged, but Zhong said authorities were leaving nothing to chance, with many patients still quarantined in wards now reasonably healthy.\n“They didn’t know if they were going to re-infect or not... so that’s why the cure rate up to now is not that high.”\nWearing masks outside contagion zones was not always necessary, he said, and the United States’ and others’ entry ban on Chinese was an over-reaction. Furthermore, it appeared children were less vulnerable, he added.\nGlobal, apolitical cooperation was crucial, Zhong said.\n“I think maybe we should be going closer, I mean in particular our colleagues and scientists, and have more cooperation,” he said. “We’re just dealing with the disease - nothing to do with the political, nothing.”\n",

There have been another 319 confirmed cases in 24 other countries, including 13 in the United States.\nOver 800 people have been evacuated from Wuhan on six U.S. evacuation flights since Jan. 28.

One of these three travelers has been released after completing a 14-day quarantine period, she said.\nThe United States has also authorized the voluntary departure of U.S. government employees and their relatives from Hong Kong, the State Department said on Tuesday.\nThe authorization was made “out of an abundance of caution related to uncertainties associated” with the disease, according to a department representative.\n",

Citizens cannot leave the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou and a few others in Hubei province, while Shanghai and Beijing have only put movement restrictions in place for some smaller communities such as building blocks or neighbourhoods.\nMany cities have reduced public transport lines and routes, while few have closed intra-city public transport entirely. Altogether, 80.41 million people have been affected by shut bus or metro lines.\nSome communities have instituted curfews or only allow people to exit and enter at particular times.

Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship.\nOf the roughly 400 Americans on the cruise, more than 40 are infected with the virus and will stay in Japan for treatment, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n“They are not going to go anywhere. They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan,” Fauci told the CBS News program “Face the Nation.” “People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the United States.”\nKyodo News Agency said the flights carrying U.S. passengers left Haneda Airport at around 1700 ET (2200 GMT).\nCanadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers.\n“Leaving in a few hours.

Fauci told the Washington Post there were 44 infected Americans.\nWithin China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit.\n“The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the Health Commission, told reporters.\nThe new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who traveled from Chinese cities, with five deaths.\nThe coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in China’s central province of Hubei. China’s response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown.\nMi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical.\nMark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Britain’s University of Edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in Hubei, “then this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too”.\nBut he added: “We should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure.”\nDeclining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in Wuhan, he said.\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted.\nOn board the Diamond Princess, American passenger Matthew Smith posted a photo on Twitter showing buses parked on the shore to take U.S. nationals to the airport. American officials in hazmat suits and masks had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay.\nThe ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in the port of Yokohama and those with the disease have been taken to hospital onshore. No one from the ship has died.\nCountries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free, and quarantine them on arrival.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense is preparing to receive two flights with passengers - one to land at Travis Air Force Base, California and the other at Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.\nThe evacuees will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.\nAnother cruise ship, Holland America’s MS Westerdam, docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports elsewhere. An 83-year-old American passenger tested positive upon arriving in Malaysia, authorities there said. A second test requested by the cruise operator confirmed the finding.\nTaiwan reported its first fatality on Sunday. The first fatality in Europe was reported on Saturday, an 80-year-old Chinese man who died at a Paris hospital.\n",

Accordingly, we have revised our growth forecasts to 5.4 per cent for 2020 and 5.8 per cent for 2021, down from our previous projections of 6.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively,\" Moody's said.\nMoody's growth projections are based on calendar year and as per its estimates, India's GDP grew 5 per cent in 2019.\nThe rating agency had in November 2019 projected India’s economic growth in 2020 and 2021 at 6.6 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively.\nIn its latest update, Moody's said the reduction in India's growth rate reflects domestic challenges rather than external factors.\nStating that the key to stronger economic momentum would be the revival of domestic demand and bank credit growth, Moody's said the Union Budget 2020 did not contain a significant stimulus to address the demand slump.\nWith a weak economy and depressed credit growth reinforcing each other, Moody's said, \"It is difficult to envision a quick turnaround of either, even if economic deceleration may have troughed.\"\n\"As similar policies in other countries have shown, tax cuts are unlikely to translate into higher consumer and business spending when risk aversion is high,\" Moody's said.\n\nThe rating agency said it expects additional easing by the Reserve Bank.\nHowever, if the recent rise in CPI inflation, mainly as a result of higher food prices, is seen to have second-round effects, this would make it more challenging for the central bank to cut interest rates further, it added.\nThe RBI has lowered the repo rate by a cumulative 135 bps in 2019.\nInflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to a 68-month-high of 7.59 per cent in January.\nRBI's mandated target range for retail inflation is 2-6 per cent and the central bank aims to keep it at 4 per cent over the medium term.\nMoody's said that resumption of credit growth is equally important as reviving demand, and banks have been reluctant to lend or lower lending rates despite successive rate cuts by the RBI.\n\"...credit impulse in the economy has deteriorated throughout the last year as a result of the drying up of lending from non-bank financial institutions as well as from banks,\" Moody's said.\nIt said the deterioration in credit growth to the commercial sector is particularly “stark”.\nNominal credit to industry grew at only 1.6 per cent year-on-year in December 2019, while credit to the services sector registered 6.2 per cent nominal growth, and credit to agriculture and related activities grew 5.3 per cent, it added.\nWith regard to global growth, Moody's said coronavirus outbreak has diminished optimism about prospects of an incipient stabilisation of global growth this year.\nGlobal GDP growth forecast has been revised down, and Moody's now expects G-20 economies to collectively grow 2.4 per cent in 2020, a softer rate than last year, followed by a pick up to 2.8 per cent  in 2021.\n\"We have reduced our growth forecast for China to 5.2 per cent in 2020 and maintain our expectation of 5.7 per cent growth in 2021,\" it added.\nMoody's expects that the spread of coronavirus will be contained by the end of March, and normal economic activity would resume in April-June quarter.\n\"At present, China's economy is by far the worst affected. However, the rest of the world also has exposure as a result of a hit to global tourism in the first half of this year and short-term disruptions to supply chains,\" it said.\n\"The effects on the global economy could compound if the rate of infection does not abate and the death toll continues to rise, because supply chain disruptions in manufacturing would become more acute the longer it takes to restore normalcy,\" Moody's added.\nThe death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic rose to over 1,660, with over 68,500 confirmed cases.\nThe coronavirus outbreak originated in central China's Hubei province in December last year and has spread to several countries.\nMany countries have banned arrivals from China, while major airlines have suspended flights to the country.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "穆迪（Moody's）周一将印度2020年经济增长预期从此前预计的6.6%下调至5.4%，原因是印度经济复苏速度低于预期。\n穆迪投资者服务公司（Moody's Investors Service）在最新发布的全球宏观经济展望中表示，印度经济在过去两年中快速减速，经济复苏可能“很浅”。\n“虽然本季度经济很可能开始复苏，但我们预计任何复苏都将低于我们此前的预期。因此，我们将2020年和2021年的增长预期分别从之前的6.6%和6.7%下调至5.4%和5.8%。\n穆迪的增长预测基于历年，根据其估计，印度2019年GDP增长5%。\n该评级机构曾在2019年11月预测，印度2020年和2021年的经济增长率分别为6.6%和6.7%。\n穆迪在最新消息中表示，印度经济增长率的下降反映的是国内挑战，而不是外部因素。\n穆迪表示，强劲经济势头的关键将是国内需求复苏和银行信贷增长，穆迪表示，欧盟2020年预算没有包含应对需求下滑的重大刺激措施。\n穆迪表示，由于经济疲弱和信贷增长低迷相互加强，“很难想象两者都会迅速好转，即使经济减速可能已经造成麻烦。”\n穆迪说：“正如其他国家的类似政策所表明的那样，在风险厌恶情绪高涨的情况下，减税不太可能转化为更高的消费者和企业支出。”。\n该评级机构表示，预计中国央行将进一步放松货币政策。\n不过，报告补充称，如果近期主要由于食品价格上涨导致的CPI通胀率上升被视为具有第二轮效应，这将使央行进一步降息面临更大挑战\n.\n印度央行已在2019年将回购利率累计下调135个基点。\n1月份，以消费者价格指数（CPI）衡量的通胀率升至68个月来的最高点7.59%。\n印度储备银行（RBI）规定的零售通胀目标区间为2%-6%，央行的中期目标是将其保持在4%。\n穆迪表示，恢复信贷增长与恢复需求同等重要，尽管印度央行连续降息，但银行一直不愿放贷或降低贷款利率。\n穆迪说：“去年，由于非银行金融机构和银行贷款的枯竭，经济中的信贷冲动一直在恶化。”。\n它表示，商业部门信贷增长的恶化尤其“严峻”。\n报告还称，2019年12月，工业名义信贷同比仅增长1.6%，服务业信贷名义增长6.2%，农业及相关活动信贷增长5.3%。\n关于全球经济增长，穆迪表示，冠状病毒爆发降低了人们对今年全球经济增长初步企稳前景的乐观情绪。\n全球GDP增长预测已经下调，穆迪目前预计，2020年20国集团经济体的总体增速将达到2.4%，较去年有所放缓，2021年将回升至2.8%。\n报告还说：“我们已将2020年中国经济增长预期下调至5.2%，并维持2021年5.7%的增长预期。”。\n穆迪预计，冠状病毒的传播将在3月底前得到遏制，4-6季度将恢复正常的经济活动。\n“目前，中国经济受影响最严重。不过，由于今年上半年全球旅游业受到冲击，供应链短期中断，世界其他地区也有风险敞口。”\n.\n穆迪补充说：“如果感染率不降低，死亡人数继续上升，对全球经济的影响可能会加剧，因为制造业供应链中断将变得更加严重，恢复正常状态所需的时间越长。”。\n中国冠状病毒疫情造成的死亡人数上升到1660多人，确诊病例超过68500人。\n冠状病毒疫情去年12月起源于中国中部的湖北省，并已蔓延到多个国家。\n许多国家禁止从中国入境，而各大航空公司则暂停了飞往中国的航班。\n",

But deaths rose by 132, up from 93 the previous day. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 with about 2,000 deaths.\nThe head of a leading hospital in China’s central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the novel virus first appeared at the end of last year.\nIllustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data “appears to show a decline in new cases” but any apparent trend “must be interpreted very cautiously.”\nOutside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.\nTedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.\n“We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,” he said.\nRussia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens.\nBy the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.\n“Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours,” Tedros said.\nChina says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.\nThe WHO’s Mike Ryan said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored.\n“Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,” Ryan said\nThe numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain’s University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.\nChinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.\nDespite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China’s ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be “limited, short-term and manageable” and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.\nEconomists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.\n“The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we’ll see a big round of layoffs,” said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).

        "news_content_translate_en": "By Melati Mohd AriffThis is a round-up of COVID-19 related matters in Malaysia and globally from Feb 10 to 14.Update as at 5.30pm: Total number of patients who have recovered in Malaysia and Indonesia's first possible COVID-19 case.Kuala Lumpur (Bernama ) -- The number of COVID-19 cases in Malaysia remains at 19 today at the time of writing since the first case was reported on Jan 25.Out of the 19 cases, six are Malaysians while the remaining 13 are Chinese citizens.Today, four more patients, all Chinese nationals, in Malaysia were reported to have recovered, bringing the total number of people who have recovered to seven. Today's cases comprised a 65-year-old woman, her daughter-in-law, 36, and two grandchildren aged 11 and two.  The three patients who had recovered earlier, also Chinese nationals, were two men aged 63 and 40 and a four-year-old girl.Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad was earlier (on Feb 12) quoted as saying that the spread of the COVID-19 virus infection remained under control and that the country was in the early containment phase.Responding to a statement issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), he said Malaysia had stepped up its preparations earlier in the event of wider transmission of COVID-19.WHO regional director for the Western Pacific Dr Takeshi Kasai told all countries, including Malaysia, to prepare for the possibility of a wider transmission of the COVID-19 virus.He said the region was at a \"critical juncture\" following reports of COVID-19 positive cases with no link to China.Meanwhile, it was reported today that a 19-year-old student from Sifnana village, Tanimbar Islands, Maluku in Indonesia has been quarantined after showing symptoms of COVID-19.The student had reportedly visited Malaysia and will be quarantined for 14 days while awaiting the test results.COVID-19 was previously identified as the Wuhan virus or 2019-nCoV and it was first detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China, on Dec 31, 2019.WHO announced the official name of the virus (COVID-19) on Feb 11 at a news conference at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. COVID-19 is the acronym for coronavirus 2019 – CO stands corona, VI for virus and D for disease.WHO also announced that the first vaccine for COVID-19 could be available in 18 months and stressed that the disease should be seen as \"public enemy number one\".On Feb 11, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to form a joint working committee to address the COVID-19 outbreak more effectively and share information on public health, medication and research.Dr Dzulkefly said the committee would be led by his deputy Dr Lee Boon Chye and Dr Lee's counterpart from Singapore. ADVICE FOR THE PUBLICMeanwhile, the public has been advised not to shake hands but practice the 'Salaam Malaysia' gesture when greeting people to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Dr Lee said the gesture – placing the right hand over the heart area of the chest – would prevent people from touching each other, thus reducing the possibility of contracting the virus.Despite the stern warning from the police and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission that action will be taken against those who spread fake news or rumours with regard to COVID-19, police have opened another investigation paper in relation to this matter, bringing the number of such cases to 23 so far.Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (Intelligence and Operations) deputy director Datuk Mohd Roze Shaari said the new investigation paper involved a case in Tumpat, Kelantan.So far three cases have been brought to court, one each in Kuala Lumpur, Terengganu and Sabah. GLOBAL STATISTICS According to the latest statistics taken from the Ministry of Health's website, the total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide currently stands at 64,267 covering 25 countries and the total number of deaths 1,489.  Reuters reported yesterday that China's Hubei province recorded 242 deaths on Wednesday (Feb 12), so far the highest number of deaths reported in a single day. Hubei's Health Commission also reported 14,840 new COVID-19 positive cases on the same day.Apart from one death in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines that occurred last week, Japan announced one death yesterday. The Japan Times quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as saying that the patient who died was a woman in her 80s who hailed from Kanagawa region in the southwest of Tokyo.Japan has 33 cases of domestic infection; however, some 218 people on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been docked at the port in Yokohama since early February, have also been tested positive for COVID-19.Besides China and Japan, others in the top 10 countries with the highest number of infections are Singapore 58 cases, Thailand 33, South Korea 28, Malaysia 19, Germany 16, Vietnam 16, Australia 15, United States 15 and France 11. Yesterday, AFP reported that several villages in Vietnam with about 10,000 people situated close to the nation's capital were placed under quarantine yesterday after six cases of COVID-19 were discovered there.On Feb 11, media reports from Wuhan stated that new research based on data gathered from more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients in China found that the incubation period for the virus was as long as 24 days rather than the previously believed 14 days.The study, carried out by about 36 researchers from Chinese hospitals and medical schools, found that less than half of the patients showed fever symptoms when they first saw a doctor.Head of the research team Dr Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese epidemiologist who discovered the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, was quoted as saying that much is still unknown about COVID-19.Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and breathing difficulty. In more severe cases, the infection can lead to lung inflammation, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. COVID-19 BACKGROUNDAccording to the WHO website, its China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia that were detected in Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019. On Jan 7, the Chinese authorities confirmed that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from human to human.Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV).A study of the virus' genetic sequence suggested similarities to that seen in snakes and bats.China health officials identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source of the transmission of the coronavirus.Besides Malaysia, COVID-19 has spread to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Vietnam, Germany, United States, France, Macau, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Russia, Spain, Finland, Cambodia, Sweden, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Belgium.On Jan 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency. By then, it had spread to 18 countries and caused 170 deaths.The declaration was aimed at preventing or reducing transmissions across borders.With 1,489 deaths worldwide as of today, COVID-19 has overtaken SARS which caused 774 deaths in 2003. Translated by Rema NambiarBERNAMA \r\n    \r\n ",

In all, they imply more than 50 basis points of reductions by year end.\nCentral banks across Asia have already been easing policy, while governments have promised large injections of fiscal stimulus, something western countries might also have to consider.\nData showing sales of smartphones in China tumbled by more than a third in January, underlining the potential economic impact of the virus, helped knock Apple Inc shares 3.5% lower on Monday.\nThe coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, feeding worries about a pandemic.\nThe rush to bonds left yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes at 1.39%, down almost 20 basis points in just three sessions and paying less than overnight rates.

We stand ready to take further action to address these risks,” the statement from the financial leaders said, using the medical acronym for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n“Global growth is expected to pick up modestly in 2020 and 2021,” they predicted. “The recovery is supported by the continuation of accommodative financial conditions and some signs of easing trade tensions.”\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said central bankers would look at options to respond to the epidemic if needed, while Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said he was ready to ease policy if necessary.\nChina was represented at the G20 meeting by its ambassador to Saudi Arabia, as senior officials stayed away due to the growing crisis over the virus.\nChinese state television quoted China’s President Xi Jinping as saying on Sunday Beijing would step up policy adjustments to help cushion the blow on the economy from the outbreak.\n“The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,” Xi said, though he added the effects would be short-term and controllable.\nSaudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told a news conference at the meeting: “We have discussed the outbreak of coronavirus in China and other countries and all the G20 countries agreed collectively on being ready to intervene with necessary policies.”\nThe epidemic, which originated in China, has since spread to nearly 30 countries and territories.\nSouth Korea raised its infectious disease alert to its highest level on Sunday but the European Union saw “no need to panic” over an outbreak in Italy.\n“In our current baseline scenario, announced policies are implemented and China’s economy would return to normal in the second quarter,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Saturday.\n“As a result, the impact on the world economy would be relatively minor and short-lived.”\n“But we are also looking at more dire scenarios where the spread of the virus continues for longer and more globally, and the growth consequences are more protracted,” she added.\nThe ministers and central bankers also encouraged further work by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on global rules to tax digital giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook.\nIntergovernmental group the OECD is to prepare technical assumptions by July that would allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.\nThe group’s efforts were stalled late last year by last-minute changes demanded by Washington, including a proposed “safe harbor” regime which critics say would let multinationals choose whether to abide by the new set of rules or stick to existing regulations.\n“I told my counterparts that Japan is very concerned about the ‘safe harbor’ proposal,” Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters, joining a chorus of criticism by France and other nations over the U.S. proposal.\n“It would extremely diminish the regulatory effect of what we’re trying to do. That is a view expressed by various countries,” he said.\nMnuchin warned, however, that he opposed discriminatory taxes on digital services, the providers of which are mostly from the United States.\nHe said Washington would respond with investigations and potential retaliatory tariffs if countries decided to go it alone, outside the OECD deal.\nA final agreement on the global rules is to be ready by the end of this year to avoid a proliferation of different digital tax regimes all over the world.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L) said on Friday that coronavirus would hit its earnings this year but it wasn’t sure by how much, becoming the latest airline to warn about the impact of the rapidly evolving outbreak.\nCoronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel plunging in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world. Airlines are flying blind into a crisis of unknown severity and duration.\nIAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year but said the uncertainty of the impact and duration of coronavirus meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.\n“It’s a rapidly changing situation,” Chief Executive Willie Walsh told reporters on Friday. “I wouldn’t call it unprecedented. We have seen other challenges for the industry.”\nBritish Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nBritish budget airline easyJet (EZJ.L) also warned on Friday that it had seen “significant” softening of demand for travel to Italy and other European markets and would cancel flights and cut costs. Finland’s Finnair (FIA1S.HE) also warned of a significant fall in profit.\nThe rapid spread of coronavirus has sent shockwaves through the global economy, hammering corporate supply chains, curbing travel, cancelling conferences and sporting events, and wiping tens of billions of pounds off financial markets.\nShare prices were on track for their worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008 and IAG’s is down 25% since the middle of January. On Friday it fell a further 8% to 474 pence.\nThe outbreak in Italy over the last week has brought new disruption to short-haul European travel but Walsh said IAG, with its strong balance sheet, was well-placed to withstand it.\n“I’m very confident that we’ll navigate our way through these challenges,” said Walsh, overseeing his last quarterly results announcement before new boss Luis Gallego takes over on March 26.\nBernstein analyst Daniel Roeska backed Walsh’s thinking: “We are also confident that a downturn would reveal the strength of the IAG model.”\nIAG said it was cutting costs and implementing revenue initiatives, which included looking at all discretionary spending, to help it weather the storm. That’s in line with moves by Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM which have both cut costs in recent days.\nIAG said flight cancellations due to falling demand would hit its 2020 capacity growth though Walsh said it could start adding capacity if other airlines fail and that the group was in a strong position to benefit from any recovery.\nThe company also said its acquisition of Air Europa remained on track for completion later this year and was not affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFor 2019, IAG reported a 5.7% drop in operating profit to 3.285 billion euros, slightly ahead of a downgraded forecast of 3.27 billion euros it gave in September when it said a pilots strike would result in a 215 million euros hit.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (Reuters) - European airlines stepped up their warnings over the coronavirus outbreak on Friday, with British Airways-owner IAG and Finnair flagging a hit to profits and easyJet reporting a big drop in demand into and out of a virus-affected region in Italy.\nAll three airlines also joined rivals in announcing cost cuts to help weather a storm of unknown severity and duration.\nA new coronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel plunging in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world, raising fears of a pandemic that could plunge the global economy into recession.\nIAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year, but said the ongoing uncertainty over the impact and duration of the outbreak meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.\nHowever, it warned: “We are currently experiencing demand weakness on Asian and European routes and a weakening of business travel across our network resulting from the cancellation of industry events and corporate travel restrictions.”\nBritish Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nLower air traffic growth projections prompted Spanish travel technology firm Amadeus (AMA.MC) to forecast slower 2020 core profit growth on Friday, but it stressed the outlook did not yet account for the uncertain impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nTo deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM (AIRF.PA) which have announced similar plans.\nIt also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.\nAirline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a stock market rout this week as coronavirus fears have gripped investors. At 0845 GMT, IAG shares were down 8% at 474.59 pence, while easyJet (EZJ.L) stock was down 3% at 1,075 pence and Finnair (FIA1S.HE) was off 3.4% at 4.922 euros.\n(Graphic: Europe's Airlines - here)\nBudget carrier EasyJet reported a “significant” softening of demand into and out of its bases in northern Italy - the center of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in Europe - and a reduction across its other European markets.\nIt also said it would be cancelling some flights, particularly into and out of Italy, and that it would make cost savings across its business, without giving details.\n“We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,” it said, adding it was too early to determine the impact on its results.\nFinnair, meanwhile, warned of a “significant” fall in operating profit this year due to virus-related disruption.\nFinland’s national airline also said its was scrapping its 2020 capacity growth target, and would look into cutting costs by 40-50 million euros ($44-54 million), with measures under consideration including temporary layoffs.\n",

Beijing and the provinces of Heilongjiang and Henan were the locations of the other three fatalities.\nThe number of new cases outside Hubei stood at 24, up from 5 on the previous day and reversing five days of declines. Ten of those were in Beijing.\nA statement published by the Comission on Thursday, citing a meeting held the previous day, said that the situation in Hubei province and Wuhan is “still complex and serious”, and added that the risk of a rebound in infection in other regions should not be overlooked.\nAlso, some coronavirus patients discharged from hospitals after recovery have been readmitted after testing positive again, health authorities said recently.\nA health official in southern Guangdong province told state media on Wednesday that 14% of patients discharged from hospital experienced a resurgence of the virus, although they had not infected any others they had been in close contact with.\nThe number of new confirmed coronavirus cases in Beijing on Feb. 26 had jumped to 10 from zero the previous day. Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of Beijing Center of Disease Control, told a news briefing on Thursday that it was a cluster case.\nThe new cases all stemmed from a property management agency in Beijing’s Chaoyang district, and had either been working in the same office or sharing the same dormitory, Pang said.\nThe case showed that companies were not putting in place adequate monitoring of staff during their 14-day quarantine period, Chen Bei, deputy secretary general of Beijing city government, told a briefing later on Thursday.\nIt has also highlighted the risks of crowded dormitories and poorly ventilated basement housing often used for some workers.\nChen said no more than six people should share basement dormitories, which should have windows. She also reiterated that people returning to Beijing must undergo a 14-day self quarantine before they’re allowed to go back to work.\nChinese authorities are also turning their attention to potential sources of infection from abroad, as the number of new cases outside China now exceed those domestically.\nThe Shanghai government said it is trying to identify anyone who came into contact with a coronavirus patient who arrived in the city from Iran, another coronavirus hotspot.\nMore than 40 countries and regions outside mainland China have reported infections. On Wednesday, cases were detected for the first time in Brazil, Pakistan, Norway, Greece, Romania and Algeria. The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 people and killed nearly 2,800, the majority in China.\nA senior medical advisor in the Chinese government who won fame for combating the SARS epidemic in 2003 on Thursday said the original source of the coronavirus remains unclear.\n“Though the virus was first discovered in China, it may not have originated from China,” said Zhong Nanshan, an 83-year-old epidemiologist.\nZhong said he believes there are other wildlife species apart from the pangolin, which is suspected as the original source emerging from a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold wild animals, that carry coronavirus.\nZhong said China would present a video report to the European Respiratory Society to share China’s experience in addressing the virus outbreak.\nHe again repeated an earlier forecast that the coronavirus outbreak in China will be contained by end-April after peaking in mid-to-late-February.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Health officials in Washington state said Sunday night that a second person had died from the coronavirus a man in his 70s from a nursing facility near Seattle where dozens of people were sick and had been tested for the virus.\nResearchers said earlier the virus may have been circulating for weeks undetected in Washington state.\nIn a statement, Public HealthSeattle & King County said the man died Saturday. On Friday, health officials said a man in his 50s died of coronavirus. Both had underlying health conditions, and both were being treated at a hospital in Kirkland, Washington, east of Seattle.\nWashington state now has 12 confirmed cases.\nState and local authorities stepped up testing for the illness as the number of new cases grew nationwide, with new infections announced in California, Illinois, Rhode Island, New York and Washington state.\nAuthorities in the Seattle area reported four new cases Sunday night, including the man who died. Two health care workers in California were also diagnosed. Of the new Washington state cases, two were women, one in her 80s and another in her 90s. Both were in critical condition. A man in his 70s was also in critical condition. All three were from the LifeCare nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, where health officials said 50 people are sick and being tested for the virus.\nOn Sunday night, the International Association of Fire Fighters said 25 members who responded to calls for help at the nursing facility are being quarantined.\nThe first U.S. case was a Washington state man who had visited China, where the virus first emerged, but several recent cases in the U.S. have had no known connection to travelers.\nIn California, two health care workers in the San Francisco Bay area who cared for an earlier coronavirus patient were diagnosed with the virus on Sunday, the Alameda and Solano counties said in a joint statement.\nThe health care workers are both employed at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville, California, and had exposure to a patient treated there before being transferred to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, the statement said. That patient was the first person in the U.S. discovered to have contracted the coronavirus with no known overseas travel.\nAlameda County declared a state of emergency on Sunday following the news.\nIn Oregon, the state Health Authority said Sunday that a second person in the state tested positive for the virus. The person is an adult in household contact with the first Oregonian to test positive and does not need medical attention, the authority said.\nElsewhere, authorities announced Sunday a third case in Illinois and Rhode Island and New York's first cases as worried Americans swarmed stores to stock up on basic goods such as bottled water, canned foods and toilet paper.\nThe hospitalized patient in Rhode Island is a man in his 40s who had traveled to Italy in February. New York confirmed Sunday that a woman in her late 30s contracted the virus while traveling in Iran. The patient is not in serious condition. She has respiratory symptoms and has been in a controlled situation since arriving in New York, according to a statement from the governor's office.\nAs the fallout continued, Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar sought to reassure the American public that the federal government is working to make sure state and local authorities are able to test for the virus. Both said during a round of TV talk show appearances Sunday that thousands more testing kits had been distributed to state and local officials, with thousands more to come.\n\"They should know we have the best public health system in the world looking out for them,\" Azar said, adding that additional cases will be reported and the overall risk to Americans is low.\nAs the cases ticked up, some Americans stocked up on basic supplies particularly in areas with diagnosed cases and began to take note of the impact on daily life. Stores such as Costco sold out of toilet paper, bottled water and hand sanitizer outside Portland, Oregon, where a case was announced Friday. Sports games and practices were canceled into the coming school week. Some churches said they would not offer communion because of fears of viral spread.\nAs Americans prepared, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington on Sunday said they had evidence the virus may have been circulating in the state for up to six weeks undetected a finding that, if true, could mean hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the area. They posted their research online, but it was not published in a scientific journal or reviewed by other scientists.\nTrevor Bedford, an associate professor who announced the preliminary findings on the virus in Washington state, said on Twitter late Saturday that genetic similarities between the state's first case on Jan. 20 and a case announced Friday indicated the newer case may have descended from the earlier one. The Jan. 20 case was the first known case in the U.S.\n\"I believe we're facing an already substantial outbreak in Washington State that was not detected until now due to narrow case definition requiring direct travel to China,\" he said on Twitter.\nBedford did not immediately reply to an e-mail requesting an interview Sunday.\nScientists not affiliated with the research said the results did not necessarily surprise them and pointed out that for many people especially younger, healthier ones the symptoms are not much worse than a flu or bad cold.\n\"We think that this has a pretty high rate of mild symptoms and can be asymptomatic. The symptoms are pretty non-specific and testing criteria has been pretty strict, so those combinations of factors means that it easily could have been circulating for a bit without us knowing,\" said Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\nDr. Adam Lauring of University of Michigan called the findings \"high quality work\" from scientists who've done similar work with the flu virus for years.\n\"They show their data and they show their work,\" Lauring said. \"It's more than a series of tweets\" because the researchers back up what they found with data that they've shared online. \"If there's something wrong, someone will find it.\"\nDr. Carlos del Rio of Emory University School of Medicine said the findings are from respected researchers in genomic sequencing and they make sense because of the geographic proximity of the two cases.\n\"This is a good time to reinforce the things we all should be doing to stop the spread of flu. Wash your hands. Don't touch your face. If you have a cold, stay home ... It's a good time to remind ourselves of that,\" he said.\nPence, named by the president to be the point-person overseeing the government's response, said more than 15,000 virus testing kits had been released over the weekend. And, the administration is working with a commercial provider to distribute 50,000 more, he said.\nThe vice president said testing was among the first issues raised by governors he's spoken with so far. Several states have begun their own testing, including Washington state, Oregon and Illinois.\n\"We're leaning into it,\" Pence said.\nAzar said more than 3,600 people already have been tested for coronavirus and the capability exists to test 75,000 people. He forecast a \"radical expansion of that\" in the coming weeks.\nPence and Azar spoke a day after President Donald Trump approved new restrictions on international travel to prevent the spread within the U.S. of the new virus, which originated in China. There are now more than 80,000 cases worldwide and about 3,000 deaths.\nThe number of known coronavirus cases in the U.S. had reached at least 80 as of Sunday, counting people evacuated from a cruise ship and the city of Wuhan in China.\nTrump said Saturday at a White House news conference that he was thinking about closing the southern border with Mexico as a precaution.

        "news_content_translate_en": "United States President Donald Trump on Saturday announced restrictions on travel from Iran and advised fellow citizens not to travel to certain areas of South Korea and Italy.\n\nThe announcement came as the first death from coronavirus was reported in the US from the Washington state.\n\"Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\"Additional cases in the United States are likely, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover. If you are healthy, you will probably go through a process and you will be fine,\" he said and urged people not to panic.\nAs many as 15 people have recovered from the virus so far in the US.\n\"There is no reason to panic at all. Our country is prepared for any circumstance,\" the President said at his second press conference in the White House briefing room on his return from India on Wednesday.\nJoining the press conference, Vice President Mike Pence said Trump had authorised a ban on entry of foreign nationals who travelled to Iran in the last 14 days.\nThe United States also advised its citizens not to travel to parts of South Korea and Italy, from where reports of coronavirus have appeared.\nThe vice president has been tasked by Trump to lead the administration's efforts in the fight against the coronavirus.\nAccording to Center for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield, 22 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the US so far.\nTrump said various wings of the US government were working on the coronavirus round the clock.\n\"It is a tough one, but a lot of progress has been made,\" the President said, adding that his administration had taken the most aggressive action in modern history to confront the disease.\nIn a statement, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee announced the death of an individual from the coronavirus.\n\"It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to their family and friends. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus,\" he said.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said there was an outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus that was first detected in the Wuhan city of China's Hubei province and has now been detected in 50 locations internationally, including cases in the United States.\nIt said the potential public health threat posed by the coronavirus was high, both globally and to the US, adding that to effectively respond to the coronavirus outbreak, rapid detection of cases and contacts, appropriate clinical management and infection control, and implementation of community mitigation efforts were critical.\nThis could best be achieved with wide availability of testing capabilities in healthcare settings, reference and commercial laboratories, and at the point of care, the FDA said.\nIt added that it would allow some 300 to 400 academic-hospital laboratories to begin testing for the virus, allowing for checks of thousands of people rather than the few hundred already tested.\n\"We believe this policy strikes the right balance during this public health emergency.\n\"We will continue to help to ensure sound science prior to clinical testing and follow-up with the critical independent review from the FDA, while quickly expanding testing capabilities in the US. We are not changing our standards for issuing Emergency Use Authorisations.\n\"This action today reflects our commitment to addressing critical public health needs and rapidly responding and adapting to this dynamic and evolving situation,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen M Hahn said.\nThe FDA guidance provides recommendations for test developers, including information regarding test validation, FDA notifications and interim confirmatory clinical testing.\nResponding to a question, Trump said he was considering closing the southern border to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\"We are looking also at (the) southern border. We have received a lot of power on the southern border over the last couple years from the courts, but we are looking at that very strongly,\" he said.\nIn a letter on Friday, several senators, including Ted Cruz, Martha McSally and John Cornyn, called for closing the coronavirus.\n\"As southern border Senators, we are concerned about the possible spread of the coronavirus across our borders,\" they said in the letter to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan.\n\"We are similarly concerned about recent reports that the virus is spreading in Europe. Border shortcomings by the European Union have resulted in the spread of the virus across a number of nations, and it is essential that the United States not repeat these mistakes.\n\"We write to ask how your agency is prepared to address the threat presented by the coronavirus at US borders,\" the senators said.\n",

There have been 26 deaths.\nA member of a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, known as Patient 31, was the first of a wave of infections to hit the country in recent weeks. The church’s suspected role in the outbreak has caused significant public anger.\nLee Man-hee, a self-proclaimed messiah who founded and heads the church, said it tried to prevent the spread of the virus among its members.\n“We did our best but were not able to stop the spread of the virus,” Lee told a news conference outside a church facility in Gapyeong, northeast of Seoul.\n“I’m really grateful, but at the same time asking forgiveness. I never thought this would happen, even in my dreams,” he told reporters, bowing low twice in a traditional sign of humility and regret.\nSeveral protesters shouted slurs at the reclusive leader, who spoke a day after the Seoul city government asked prosecutors to begin a murder investigation into him.\nSeoul said the church was liable for its refusal to cooperate with efforts to stop the disease.\nThe secretive church faces unprecedented scrutiny from authorities and the public, with all of its 310,000 known followers and “trainees” being tested for the virus.\nA church spokesman showed documents saying Lee tested negative for the virus.\nLee said many people had “misunderstandings” about the church, but did not elaborate.\nThe church issued a statement late on Sunday saying it was complying with government measures and reiterating calls for an end to “stigmatization, hatred and slander” against its followers.\n“Our priority is to cooperate with authorities to combat the coronavirus as soon as possible,” a church official told reporters after the news conference.\nTensions simmered ahead of the briefing outside the fortress-like venue, dubbed the Palace of Peace, which was guarded by hundreds of police officers.\nThe church had initially sought to hold the event inside the compound, known as a training institute for its members, but local authorities rejected the plan citing virus concerns.\nA note was posted on the gate of the compound saying it had been sealed off on Feb. 24. There was also a “beware the lion” sign.\nLee Yeon-woo, 54, held a tearful vigil outside, saying she had not heard from her daughter since she joined the church six years ago.\nSome former church members told Reuters that many young believers were forced to leave home and live in dormitories near the church as part of initiation, breaking ties with their families.\n“Shincheonji destroys families and separates children from their parents,” said Lee Yeon-woo. “I can’t sleep at night thinking my daughter might have been infected and is groaning with pain in seclusion.”\nGovernment officials warned of a “critical moment” in early March in South Korea’s battle with the largest virus outbreak outside China, urging South Koreans to minimize travel and avoid gatherings.\nThe education ministry said it will postpone the start of all schools’ new semester by two weeks to March 23.\n“Two weeks are essential for the coronavirus outbreak to ease,” minister Yoo Eun-hae told a briefing.\nOf the new 464 cases reported earlier on Monday by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), 377 were from the southeastern city of Daegu, home to a Shincheonji branch where Patient 31 had attended services.\nKCDC said some members of the Shincheonji church in January visited the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged late last year, though it was investigating to determine whether that played a role in the outbreak.\nA church official said their own survey showed no one had gone to Wuhan since December, though there were 357 followers there.\n",

In Hubei, only 116 patients died of the disease, as the provincial Health Commission reports on state television. This causes almost 1400-year-old deaths throughout the country. Experts, however, also look at the new figures with caution and fear a high dark number.\nThe newly submitted statistics also caused confusion at first. According to its own information, the National Health Commission deducted cases from the previous day from the national aggregate statistics because it counted Hubei figures twice. The day before yesterday there had been excitement because the number of newly confirmed infections had increased dramatically by 15.000. The reason was the new counting method, which also included the clinical diagnoses of the Covid-19 lung disease mentioned in recent weeks.\nBecause the DNA tests in the laboratory often fail to detect the infection, cases of pneumonia, fever, respiratory problems and other typical Covid-19 symptoms are now also included, and therefore a diagnosis of the infection can be made without a laboratory test.\nIn the 4823 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus mentioned on Friday in Hubei, 3095 such cases with only clinical diagnosis were also included, as reported by the Provincial Health Commission. However, the new census is only applied in Hubei, not in the rest of the country. This will allow patients to be treated more appropriately and prevent further spread of the virus more effectively.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) welcomed the new approacYeah. It allows people in Hubei to be isolated and treated more quickly and allows contact persons to be observed earlier. As hospitals in Hubei and their medical staff are completely overwhelmed by the high number of patients, more than 21.000 medical professionals from other parts of the country have already been sent to the crisis region, as Xinhua News Agency reported.\nWith the return wave of tens of millions of Chinese returning to their jobs after the extended New Year holidays due to the epidemic, concerns are growing about the further spread of the virus. According to Chinese press reports, an infection was detected in a member of the cleaning staff on a high-speed train, which raised concerns about infections on the train.\nOutside mainland China, more than two dozen countries around 580 are confirmed, most in Japan. There was an accumulation of more than 200 cases on the cruise ship \"Diamond Princess\" located outside Yokohama. Asian countries are therefore reluctant to allow cruise ships to enter their ports. For example, the Aidavita, with around 1100 passengers mostly from Germany and 400 crew members, could not start as planned in Vietnam. The shipping company insisted there were no virus outbreaks on board. Nor did the ship enter a Chinese port.\nIn Germany 16 infections have been detected. The first patient was able to leave a Bavarian clinic on Thursday as cured. In Bavaria, 13-infected people are still being treated, all of them related to the car supplier Webasto. A Chinese employee had planted the virus there. Two infected Wuhan returnees are also housed in the Frankfurt University Clinic, a clinic spokesman said.\nIn addition to the infected, more than 100 people are under quarantine in GermanyYeah. At present 122 people are staying in a barracks in the Palatinate Germersheim, which had been taken from the heavily afflicted Chinese city of Wuhan in early February. When her quarantine is lifted, it will be decided on Sunday. In Berlin, around 20-more Wuhan returnees are isolated. A second test had also shown no infections.\nThe consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak for Germany are difficult to estimate. \"We are currently unable to predict the dynamics of the outbreak,\" said the president of Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lothar Wieler, on Thursday in Berlin. Virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite said the pathogen Sars-CoV-2 multiplies like the flu virus in the throat, making it more contagious than initially suspected. Everyone should learn about the disease and ask themselves, for example, how people with basic family diseases can be protected.\nIn China, the statistical death rate is approximately two percent, except for 0.2 percent, said Wieler. Special risk groups are elderly patients. (dpa",

According to a study, the virus could be harmful to the global automotive industry.\nThe German Bundesbank sees risks for the German economy. According to the head of the Institute for the World Economy (IfW), Gabriel Felbermayr, the damage is \"disproportionately greater\" with each day production plants in the second largest economy in the world are shut down. Producers in Germany and other countries were dependent on Chinese inputs, stocks did not last forever, Felbermayr told the \"Trade Sheet\" (Monday).\nA temporary decline in overall economic demand in China could dampen German exports, the German Bundesbank explained in the current monthly report. China is an important market for \"Made in Germany\" goods.\nAt the same time, many products are produced there, including for further processing in other countries. Security precautions for the virus could affect some global value chains, the monthly report said. \"Supply bottlenecks in individual industries in the country would be the consequence,\" wrote the Bundesbank experts.\nFrom the point of view of the RWI Leibniz Institute of Economic Research, the economic impact of the epidemic depends on how long production in China is hampered.\n\"In our estimation, economic growth in China in the first quarter could be dampened by approximately 2.5 percent,\" economic experts Roland Dhrurn told dpa. Compared to the previous year, it would only be between three and four percent instead of six percent as expected. \"This development will also be noticeable in Germany, in particular through lower exports and a steady supply of pre-products by Chinese suppliers,\" explained DhrurnYeah.\nAccording to a study, the Sars-CoV-2 virus could be harmful to the global automotive industry. Only in the particularly affected Chinese province of Hubei, nearly two million cars per year would be produced in over a dozen locations, according to the analysis of the consulting company BCG.\nThe new Coronavirus has already affected many industries, it is said, the study of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). \"But the car industry stands out as one that feels the effects quickly and deeply in view of China's crucial role.\" Thus, the country is the largest market for new cars and, at the same time, an important location for manufacturers and suppliers. \"The automotive industry will be affected locally and around the globe,\" writes the consultants with a view to disrupted supply chains.\nFor German manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Volkswagen and Porsche, China is the most important market. At VW, the People's Republic represents a good 40-percent of deliveries. And when it comes to converting to electric cars, the corporations depend on battery cells from China. US manufacturers also depend on the Far East: GM sells more cars in China than in the USA, BCG said.\nThe new lung disease has already hit the German car companies. For example, because of the Coronavirus BMW had extended the Chinese New Year holidays at its world's largest location in the millionth city of Shenyang.\nVolkswagen had to postpone production because of the epidemic. Production at the plants of the joint venture with Shanghai Automotive (SAIC) should not take place until 24. In February, instead of being resumed this Monday, the Group explained. The reasons are problems in the supply chains and logistics as well as limited travel possibilities for employeeYeah. The other plants operated with manufacturers of First Automotive Works have partly resumed production or are expected to resume production in the coming days, it was said.\nThe chemical industry has so far felt \"little impact\" on the industry in Germany. In China, however, German chemical companies had already shut down production, according to VCI. Demand in the People's Republic had fallen and value chains had been damaged. \"With every day that the Corona epidemic continues, the risk of negative consequences for the global economy increases,\" warned VCI chief executive Wolfgang Grande Entrup.

        "news_content_translate_en": "A new coronavirus, which has been infected by hundreds of thousands of people in the world, is likely to be able to adapt to its own vector, Because it's not good for any parasite to kill its owner. A leading Russian virologist and professor talked about this in an interview with the Russian news agency, as well as the spread prospect of covid-19 in Russia and the possibility of pets infected with the virus. Director of microbial ecology laboratory, DVF biomedical school Yegorov's hopes are in conversation.\n-Mikhail Yuryevich has begun the first trial of the C Lo Navin Ross vaccine. How do you evaluate its future?\nSo far everything has gone well. I think there will be vaccines in Russia by summer. I still hope that this proposal does not need to be widely applied. The best option - the vaccine is still a back-up option. Intermediate programs - vaccines are only available to the elderly at risk, people with diabetes, overweight and cardiovascular disease. These are the standard risk categories of orz. In the worst case, the vaccine must include a seasonal influenza vaccine. But I don't think it will come, I hope the best.\nToo many coronaviruses are immune, but only experiments can make us establish its stabilityAbout But from the beginning, we can say that it will be several years, that is to say, the most likely, immunity will not exist for a lifetime.\n-Can humans adapt to a new coronavirus?\n-Humans can't, viruses can. It is not good for any parasite to kill its owner. If the virus is too virtual, it's not good for him. Sooner or later, the virus will spread among the population, leading to increasingly mild diseases. The virus is easier to adapt because it changes faster. Generally speaking, viruses do not exist as a single solution, which is a cloud choice. They chose those selective advantages over others, which is an advantage - less toxic to their owners - people. That is to say, we will not adapt to him, and he is ours, which is normal.\nSo, one day, people can put corona on their feet?\n-Flu, which we also put on our feet when we are young, when we arrive at risk, can be bad. In this case, coronavirus components will need to be included in the seasonal vaccine.\nYou have reported that the virus is sensitive to high temperature. Does Russia have the risk of another positive cycle when it enters the low tide in summer?\nThis is a riskAbout If the virus becomes a seasonal normal component of ozone depleting substances, it will show seasonal influenza like other epidemic mumps with low toxicity.\nIt is important not to allow the virus to enter the action space and adapt to the human population from the beginning. During 2002-2003, not only in China, but also around the world, the situation of close relatives of the new Colorado virus (SARS) was under control. In other words, the spread of infectious diseases has not continued on such a large scale that the virus can adapt to the human population. But what the United States and the European Union show us today is the eighteenth century. This is related to the characteristics of who there, including preventive measures.\n-In this case, is the slow spread of Russian virus related to the security measures taken by China?\n-Russia has the best biosafety system in the world since the Soviet Union. Don't confuse it with the system of the Ministry of health - it's not about treating patients, it's about prevention, organizing prevention, It is the responsibility of the Russian consumer protection agency and other agencies. Everyone works together and shows good inter agency cooperation. That's what you've got - all the bad cases, we see, don't spread to epidemic outbreaksAbout Only in the worst case can the virus spread within the family. But it often does not exist, because it will soon be found that the correct diagnosis and rapid positioning.\nThat's what we don't see in the biosafety systems of the United States and the European Union. The fact that it is too early for who to announce the pandemic is due to the panic of political elites in the United States and the European Union, which needs to be concealed and is spreading. But I don't think I should.\n-Do you think that Russia's current measures to combat Colorado Russia are enough, or should everyone stay at home?\n-Enough, even a good reserve. The only thing to remember is that the social system is complex and random: someone flees quarantine, for example. Sometimes even a slight vibration is enough to break the stability. Therefore, safety measures must be treated responsibly. The authorities have taken sufficient measures, but no one can guarantee whether they are sufficient to meet the current situation of our society.\n-As you have said, this type of coronavirus cannot be excluded artificiallyAbout Can a naturally mutated virus be triggered in China, as reported by some media?\n-This virus is a natural virus, like all natural viruses, it can circulate in the population of its natural reservoir, in this case, it is a bat), without human participation. If one strengthens the interaction between groups, for example, Collect a large number of wild animals for sale in the Eastern market. This is because SARS CoV, with the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus) mers CoV, occurs in Wuhan market and is related to the epidemiology of today's sars-cov-2. Most likely, from what we know, it happened there. But I would like to emphasize once again that this is a normal process.\nHumans have yet to overcome any other natural infection, and coronavirus will not be the first to be here. Therefore, for natural viruses, the principle can only be one - regular monitoring, so that scientists can do this by monitoring the virus's intensified cycle. A reasonable assumption in science. Unfortunately, the grant system does not support regular monitoring of natural origin viruses, which is deplorable.\nIn addition, it is clear that Russia has insufficient viral capacity. Molecular genetic systems work very fast, and we have very few institutions that can deal with particularly dangerous virusesAbout Not at all in the Far East. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and strengthen a high-level biosafety virus laboratory system.\nHow many such laboratories are there in this country?\n-There are two world-class institutions: the Novosibirsk vector and the Institute of Microbiology of the Ministry of defense This is the work of all the first pathogens in this country. That is to say, in the eastern part of Novosibirsk, we have a big white spot. Although there are experts, we can also set up schools in a reasonable time. But we need a clear political order.\n-Is there any data on the race and genetic selectivity of Colorado virus?\n- No. There is no scientific evidence that ethnicity can aggravate or weaken the role of the virus. In the case of age, yes. As we all know, children under the age of 12 are statistically justified, and we know the molecular mechanism of this - they are rarely ill, they are milder. But that doesn't mean they have to be excluded from risk groups. With age, people will encounter other risk groups - overweight, cardiovascular disease and so on. But middle-aged people can't be protected just because of their age.\n-Can pets get infected?\nMany mammals may be infected. But we don't know how serious they are, how many viruses they have releasedAbout Few bats directly infect people in the same China. Most often, they infect the host in the middle. In terms of SARS in 2002, these are Himalayan civets used in East Asia. As far as the Middle East is concerned, it's camels, which infect themselves and later infect people. In the case of the new coronavirus, the host in the middle, we don't know yet, but it may be a pangolian exotic animal, Kitchen in the East and medicine in the East.\nIt's possible to infect small mammals, dogs and cats, including, but that doesn't mean that pain, they can infect people. We don't eat them, unlike China's Himalayan civet. Maybe, in our condition, they are pets). - about. Red... \") is also the victim, the dead branch of the virus cycle. But all this needs to be studied.\n-What is your prediction of the course and end of the pandemic?\n-The pandemic ended when the United States and the European Union ended, because it was under them. It will be a will decision of who, as well as a political decision to announce it.\nIn Russia, when our compatriots continue to return from abroad, the number of malignant events will increase to a certain extentAbout But I hope there won't be a wave of epidemics like the European Union in Russia.\nFor the United States and Western Europe, they can do anything, either in terms of their actions or in comparison with China's clear and consistent actions. It is this fire that can easily spread to neighboring countries, and to neighboring countries. As far as the Russian Federation is concerned, it remains the pillar of European stability, in all respects as well",

        "news_content_translate_en": "As of Monday, the Federal Ministry of Interior (BMI) has ordered temporary border controls. These will take place at the internal borders with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark.\nGerman nationals, persons with residence status and first domicile in Germany are still allowed to enter Germany. Returning from Italy, Austria and Switzerland are asked to stay at home for 14 days after their return. This applies irrespective of whether or not there is a specific Corona case.\nNew guidelines for border controls are intended to ensure the free movement of goods within the European internal market. The cross-border movement of goods and professional commuters is therefore guaranteed. The latter are asked to provide evidence of their activities. Passengers \"without valid travel reason\" may no longer enter or leave the abovementioned borders.\nIn individual cases, a personal reason may also be considered \"valid\". It is up to the border police to decide what private cross-border travel they allow. According to BMI, federal police officers are experienced in assessing such individual cases, as this is their daily business.\nIn addition to Germany and many other countries, the European Union will now close all its external borders. Travels between EU countries and other countries are suspended for 30 days. The measure should apply from Tuesday afternoon.\nAccording to EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, there are supposed to be exceptions for citizens with a permanent residence permit for the EU. Also for EU citizens, diplomats, doctors, nurses, researchers and experts. And also for people who transport important goods, as well as commuters who work in the EU.\nFederal and Countries want to drastically reduce tourism in GermanYeah. On Monday, the Federal Government decreed that overnight stays such as hotels or hostels in Germany \"can only be used for necessary and explicitly not for tourist purposes\" for the time being. In the evening, Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a speech, \"that there should be no holiday home or abroad\".\nThe Robert Koch Institute currently includes the following countries: Areas of risk: Italy, Iran, China: Hubei province, South Korea: Gyeongsangbuk-do province, France: Grand Est region (including Alsace, Lorraine and Champagne-Ardenne), Austria: Tirol federal state, Spain: Madrid, USA: California, Washington and New York.\nThe more important question at the moment is: should I still be travelling? The Federal Government's Crisis Lab provides a clear answer by discouraging all non-essential travel abroad. The reason: Because of the measures taken against the Coronavirus, travellers are at increased risk of not being able to return to Germany without further ado. In addition, further drastic restrictions on air and travel are expected in the short term, writes the Foreign Office.\nIn order to slow down the spread of the new virus, many governments have decided to restrict entry worldwide. For example, Poland has closed its borders to foreigners, international air and train connections have been suspended. The United States has banned all entry from Europe for a 30-day period. The entry ban applies to Europeans who have stayed in the Schengen area within a period of 14 days before entering the United States in Germany or another country.\nOther countries, such as Russia or Romania, are committing German immigrants to a 14-day quarantine. Other states, including India, have declared invalid all visas already issued for German nationalYeah. Thailand, on the other hand, does not (yet) have a hard stop.\nYour country's entry regulations may also change spontaneously at the moment. It is therefore essential that you inform yourself at short notice, for example at the Foreign Office, at the respective national representation in Germany or at the German Embassy in your country of travel. It is also recommended to keep informed about the current status of booked flights with the airlines.\nThis is not\nuniformly regulated. The contracts of some suppliers include a\nPandemic. In other words, the insurance does not have to pay if a customer is infected with the relevant pathogen during a pandemic. However, some suppliers do not accept this possibility from Kulanz.\nInsurers are currently checking whether their protection continues to apply when customers in\ntravel a country classified by the Robert Koch Institute as a risk area.\nThe validity of some foreign health insurance could therefore still be restricted. Many insurers now publish FAQs with more information on their website.\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) has launched a recovery operation for thousands of Germans who are stuck abroad due to travel restrictions in the Corona crisis. Most Germans, approximately 4.000 to 5.000 persons, are located in Morocco according to the Foreign Office. The Federal Army is not currently involved in the repatriation, as there would be enough aircraft available from Lufthansa, for example. These would be used on behalf of the government.\nThe Foreign Office has formally issued a worldwide travel warning for tourist travel.\nAt Deutsche Bahn, tickets can be exchanged for vouchers, even if they are so-called savings prices or super savings prices. A fee is not appropriate. This applies to tickets before the 13th. They were bought in March and the day of the trip between the 13th. March and 30th. April is lyinYeah. The railway has created an online form for this purpose. The application will also be accepted after the day of the trip. Another possibility is to make these tickets flexible up to thirty. Use June on another day. The train's been disconnected. Only city tickets are no longer valid.\nThe German market leader Flixbus will cease operations from Wednesday. The company reported this in Munich. All national and cross-border connections to and from Germany are affected. Passengers affected would be informed about bus crashes, they said. You'd get a voucher for the entire ticket price. The company Blablabus also ceases operations from Wednesday morning.\nLast Monday, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared the whole of Italy a restricted zone. Travel within the country is therefore generally prohibited, but exceptions are possible. In the same way as the measures previously imposed on northern Italy, the restrictions should initially be up to three. April applies. Conte explained: \"Our habits must change now. We must all give up something for the good of Italy.\"\nAll shops have been closed since Thursday except supermarkets and pharmacies. This includes bars and restaurants as well as theatres and museums.\nThe Federal Government advises against all unnecessary trips to Italy after the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) had classified the whole country as a risk area. The Foreign Office has since updated its travel instructions. Previously, the indications only applied to regions particularly affected in the north of the country.\nThe Foreign Office points out that it is still possible to return to a place of residence both inside and outside Italy. Checks and requests by security and law enforcement should, however, be expected. A self-declaration on the necessity of a journey within the country would have to be completed and carrieYeah.\nUnfortunately, there is currently no flat-rate answer for all travellers. Contact your tour operator as soon as possible. There you will get information about what you can do if you have booked holidays in countries with travel restrictions. Usually cancellation is free of charge if a travel warning from the Foreign Office is available. As far as the new Coronavirus is concerned, such a warning only applies to the Chinese province of Hubei.\nYou can often cancel your booking even if you have to expect significant changes to your planned trip, writes the Consumer Centre. This applies not only to entry bans, but doubtless even when essential sights cannot be visited. Individual travellers are best able to contact the airlines, railway or bus companies directly and the accommodation already booked or the booking portal used.\n\"If there is a specific danger due to exceptional circumstances, you can cancel for free,\" says the Hamburg lawyer Oliver Matzek, specialist in travel law. Weather or strikes, as well as medical emergencies such as an epidemic, are recognised as exceptional circumstances. In order to find out whether such an exceptional circumstance as a cancellation circumstance is appropriate for your destination, it is best to ask your contractor directly.\nAnyone wishing to cancel an already booked trip for fear of infection, without any specific travel restrictions, can always invoke the cancellation rules agreed upon at the conclusion of the contract, regardless of the Coronavirus.\nIf you do not cancel your trip yourself but, for example, the airline cancels your connection, your ticket price is usually refunded in full. The same applies if a whole package tour is cancelleYeah.\nMost travel cancellation insurance covers only the pre-departure illness, not the risk of possible infection during the journey. You can find the exact terms and conditions of your insurance policy. In principle, you can take out insurance at any time before the first day of your trip, but with a decisive limitation: \"At the time of conclusion of the contract, the insurance case may not have occurred yet,\" explains lawyer Matzek. Thus, existing risks cannot be insured. This also applies to the Corona epidemic, which is particularly important if you are travelling in regions that have already been classified as a risk area.\nReturning from Italy, Austria and Switzerland are asked to stay at home for 14 days after their return. This applies irrespective of whether or not there is a specific Corona case.\nAnyone who develops symptoms typical of the new Coronavirus within a 14-day period after returning from a risk area should call the emergency medical service, which can be reached nationally under 116117. Typical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, but the disease caused by the Coronavirus Covid-19 can vary greatly according to RKI. If you suspect that you are infected, stay at home and do not visit a doctor's office or an emergency room on your own, thereby risking infecting your fellow human beings in doubt.\nAs there are no serious predictions as to how the Coronavirus epidemic is developing, this question is not easy to answer at the moment. Many tour operators pause their program until (first) the end of April and relax their cancellation rules. Read more about the question: How safe is the summer holiday 2020",

Finally, a group of experts from the World Health Organization, WHO, visited China for nine days and evaluated the data from nearly 56.000 infected patients treated in Chinese hospitals (PDF: Joint Mission Report Covid-19, 2020). According to these data, about 22-percent of the over 80-year-old infected died of Covid-19. That's more than any fifth.\nComparison: Overall, the mortality rate, i.e. the proportion of people who died from the infection, was almost four per cent in this study. In fact, it is still likely to be significantly lower, as many infections are so mild that those affected did not have to be treated in hospital or even noticed because they did not go to medical treatment.\nIn another major study with almost 45.000 Chinese patients, about 15 percent of patients who were at least 80-year-old died (CDC Weekly: CPERE Novel, 2020Yeah. Among the 70- to 79-year-olds, every twelfth, i.e. eight percent, of the disease, in the 60- to 69-year-olds it was 3.6 percent. This shows that from fifty to sixty years the risk of serious illness increases significantly. Without specific therapy and a vaccine, these people need a place in an intensive care unit, a respirator and a circulatory stabilizer. And these places are in danger of becoming scarce.\nOf course, there can also be mild courses of Covid-19 disease for people of high age. But they are more unlikely because, over the years, the body's defenses are less effective, researchers speak of immunity censorship.\" For older people, it can happen that their body reacts late to the virus, the pathogen can spread more than for younger ones,\"says virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine. This could in many cases even cause the immune system to overreact later and attack not only pathogens, but also own body cells.\" Such a reaction is one of the reasons why many old people with Covid-19 are doing so badly.\"\nBut even basic diseases can cause the virus to settle in the body and overcome its defenses. And this applies in principle to people of all ages who have mainly cardiovascular diseases, diabetes or high blood pressure. This increases the risk of a serious Covid-19 infection, as researchers from China write in The Lancet magazine (Zhou et al., 2020).\" Pre-illness reduces the performance of the body. The immune system has a harder time resisting the pathogens,\"says Schmidt-Chanasit. This applies to sick people regardless of their age. But older people are particularly affected because they are more often not only suffering from a pre-existing disease, but severaYeah.\nThe Robert Koch Institut e also identifies people with chronic liver and lung disease, people suffering from cancer or immunodeficiency, and smokers. Covid-19 is a lung disease, so anything that affects or directly damages the airways can become a problem. These include cigarettes, of course, but sometimes also evaporators. Smoking could at least be a cause of men dying of the infection more often than women in China. Because there smoking is more a man's business. If this assumption is confirmed, further data must be provided.\nIn Italy, which is particularly hard hit by Sars-CoV-2, the age of more than three quarters of the reported patients is over fifty years, approximately 40 percent older than 70. This could be one of the reasons why many people with Sars-CoV-2 are dying there at the moment. More than 1.000 deaths are currently reported. We also know that the intensive care centres of hospitals in Lombardy are currently overloaded. And that, although the clinics in the region around Milan are among the best organized in the country, as Italy's most famous virologist Roberto Burioni explains in an interview with ZEIT ONLINE. \"If the epidemic now spreads to other, structurally weaker regions, everything could get even worse,\" says Burioni.\nIn such a situation, more people can die who would survive under normal circumstances (The Lancet: Ji et al., 2020). For example, if patients with severe heart disease or kidney problems no longer have intensive beds available and therefore do not receive important therapies or are delayed. According to the German hospital company, such beds are located around 28.000 in Germany, and in winter, despite flu medication, antibiotics and vaccinations, they are often occupied by patients with influenza or bacterial infections\" Fortunately, Germany is still far from a situation like in Italy,\"says Clemens Wendtner, chief physician at the Munich clinic Schwabing. The most important thing now is to slow down the outbreak in such a way that as few Corona patients as possible need to be medically treated and ventilated at once.\nThe only way to do this is now recommended by the Federal Government and the Chancellor: to reduce social contacts wherever possible. Scientists and politicians have been promoting this social distance for weeks. Because it remains important: as few people as possible should be infected with Sars-CoV-2 to buy time at the moment. Days and weeks that can help relieve clinics, nurses and doctors. It is only when everyone avoids contact that the likelihood decreases that, above all, undetected infected people with mild symptoms infect all those who may be severely ill with Covid-19.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has compiled advice on how to protect themselves from the new Coronavirus infection (WHO: Situation Report -51). Here are the most important summaries:\nIf this does not happen, it could be difficult: \"More viruses will then be carried in hospitals, personnel, which is already scarce anyway, and other patients will get infected and chaotic conditions will arise,\" says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit. According to the Hamburg virologist, such situations in which hospital operations are disrupted would also harm patients who have nothing to do with the Coronavirus.\nA healthy 26-year-old student can also catch the new Coronavirus. The infection can be severe for her, and it is not excluded that she will die of the new Covid-19 pneumonia. But it's not likelYeah. Because most young people have a mild Sars-CoV-2 infection. This means that a disease can be cured at home, perhaps with some fever and cough or similar symptoms. Of the nearly 45.000 infected from the second major study from China, only one person is listed who was between ten and 19 years old and died, among the patients between 20 and 29 years there were seven.\nThis is why young adults, children and pregnant women play the role of carriers in the current outbreak of Sars-CoV-2. They bring the virus to the elderly and the sick, for example during a family reunion on a Sunday, at a gun party, in a crowded theatre or when Grandma and Grandpa watch the children for a few hours in the afternoon.\nFor most, the symptoms of Covid-19 can seem so harmless that under normal circumstances they are unlikely to be aware that they are a danger to others: about 88 percent of hospital patients from the WHO study had a fever, about two thirds dry cough. A little less common were symptoms such as headaches, blocked nose or even rare diarrhoea. The virus became really dangerous, less than a fifth of the infected. Severe respiratory distress experienced almost fourteen percent and about six percent of cases were critical. That means patients had to be ventilated artificially.\nThe situation is similar in Germany, where the Robert Koch Institute published more detailed medical data on 737, which has now published more than 2.000 cases. Only twelve of them, i.e. 1.6 percent, were diagnosed with pneumonia. Most infected people suffered from coughing, fever or snoring (PDF: daily RKI status report from 11. March 2020).\nThere is also good news: children are relatively rarely affected by Covid-19, although they may be as infected as adultsYeah. This at least suggests a study, published without scientific advice, in which researchers have analysed symptoms and disease progressions of around 400 infected and their relatives (medRxiv: Bi et al., 2020). It showed that children were almost as often infected by a sick family member as the elderly. And that, although the age of most reported Covid-19 infected is significantly higher, between 30 and 69 years. Only 2,4 percent of the subjects studied in the WHO survey were 18-year-old or younger.\n\"The immune system of children reacts slightly differently from that of adults,\" says the virologist Schmidt-Chanasit. The fact that illnesses in adults were significantly more severe is known, for example, from the wind spikes. What is the reason for this in the case of Sars-CoV-2, there are not yet sufficient data, only conjectures: \"For example, the connecting points that the virus uses to invade the human cell may be less highly trained than in the elderly.\" Virus es may therefore be more difficult to enter the cells, to do damage.\nMany children who were examined in the WHO survey had such mild symptoms that their infection was only detected when someone from the family was sick and then routinely tested all the people around them.\" Children are transmitters of the virus, even though they are hardly noticeable in the statistics,\"says Wendtner. He's already treated several Covid-19 patients. Including a family where a 12-year-old child has most likely infected its family members.\" In this case, too, the child had only mild symptoms,\"says Wendtner. There was therefore a risk that children, although rarely observed to date, would bring the virus from kindergarten or school into the family.\nAnother group that normally needs special protection from other agents are pregnanYeah. For many infectious diseases they are considered a risk group because their immune system is more susceptible to infections. For this reason they are specifically advised to be vaccinated against the flu. But what else makes it particularly vulnerable could be an advantage in the case of the new Coronavirus.\" In pregnancy, a woman's body is virtually completely reprogrammed,\"says Schmidt-Chanasit.\"The body of a woman The hormone levels are different, the immune system reacts differently.\"This may play a role in why, according to previous findings, pregnant women are often less affected by Covid-19 than by other infections. A study in nine Covid-19 pregnant women also suggested that the virus is unlikely to be passed on to their children, not in adults in the womb or via breast milk (The Lancet: Chen et al., 2020)",

Chinese scientists have found that the Malay pangolin virus smuggled into Chinese territory is very similar to sars-cov-2, which is responsible for the covid-19 epidemic. The results have been published in the journal Nature.\nCurrent data show that the main source of coronate-cov-2 is bats. But in order for the virus to spread from bats to humans, intermediate animals are needed. In the past, because of SARS CoV and mers CoV, Palmetto branch and troostite were intermediates respectively. Their coronavirus infection rate was 99.8%.\nThe transition species of animals, in which sars-cov-2 virus mutates into human \"choice\", have not been found.

Another possible alternative is pangolin, which has the same coronavirus as bats. These rare animals are illegally transported from Malaysia to ChinAbout Their meat is considered delicious, while scaly shells are used in traditional medicine.\nChinese scientists, with the assistance of their Australian counterparts, analyzed frozen samples of pangolin tissue and blood seized in anti smuggling operations, The Chinese government has implemented a series of projects in southern China in 2017-2019. 31 animal samples were studied.

A new date will be set by the Standing Committee of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party at a later date. The ten-day meeting was actually on 5th. In March. Around 6.000 delegates from all over the country should have participated.\nLast week, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress had already spoken in favour of a postponement of the date. According to CCTV, the People's Congress is being postponed for the first time since the Cultural Revolution. Since 35 years he has always met in March. The postponement was also motivated by the fact that many of the MEPs were \"on the front line\" fighting the epidemic.\nChina has recently seen a sharp increase in the numbers of corona virus infected. More than 77.000 people have contracted lung disease. 2.592 people had died as a result of the virus. It is believed that the pathogen has passed from a wild animal to humans in a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The Standing Committee of the Politburo therefore also advised at its meeting this Monday to ban the trade in wild animals, as the official news agency Xinhua reported.\nWuhan has been sealed off from the outside world for a month. However, many foreign citizens have been brought back to their home countries from there. For the first time, experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) are now also in Wuhan. They visit two hospitals and meet the head of the Chinese Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, as well as other persons responsible for the disease protection of the province of Hubei.\nAt the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organization WHO a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause from WuhaYeah. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).\nSars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 are the same pathogens that infect bats. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, and every third party has died from it.\nOverall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.\nMedical practitioners assume that the virus is transmitted from person to person mainly by drip infection.\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nMore than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers suspect roughly somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all casesYeah. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.\nFollow the progress of registered cases in Germany on this map.\nThe number of infected worldwide tested positive for Corona shows this map from Johns Hopkins University.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO is treating the disease as a pandemic. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.\nTypical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinations. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccination.\nIn Italy, the country most affected by the virus in Europe, the fifth Covid-19 death has since been reported. More than 200 infected have been registered so far. The Italian authorities had taken draconian measures to contain the virus at the weekend. Eleven communities in the north of the country have been sealed off, 52.000 people are practically quarantined. The carnival in Venice ended prematurely.\nThe EU Commission welcomed Italy's steps to contain the Coronavirus. The Italian government had acted quickly and \"effective structures to respond in a well-coordinated manner to this outbreak\", said EU Commissioner responsible for crisis coordination Janez LenarciYeah. He announced the release of 232 million euros to strengthen the global fight against the virus.\nPossible border controls in the Schengen area lie within the competence and decision of the individual Member States, said Lenarcic. However, he urged governments to take all decisions to combat the virus on the basis of a \"credible risk assessment\" and to act in a proportionate and coordinated manner.\nAccording to EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides, the Italian Government has agreed to a mission of WHO experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). This is due to arrive in Italy on Tuesday.\" We must take this situation seriously,\"said Kyriakides. However, EU citizens should'do not panic'and fall into misinformation about the disease.\nIn Iran, in the city of Ghom, at least fifty people died of Covid-19 last month. For example, the British Intelligence Agency The Guardian quoted the semi-state Iranian news agency ILNA. Therefore, in Ghom, south of the capital Tehran, 250 people are under quarantine. A city official, Ahmad Amiribadi Farahani, said the numbers went back to the 13th. February. However, Iran did not have until 19th. February reports infected and dead by the Coronavirus. Health Minister Saeid Namaki had first confirmed 12 deaths.\nThe first case of a disease has also been confirmed in neighbouring Afghanistan. Health Minister Firusuddin Firus said at a televised press conference that the case had occurred in the province of Herat, which borders Iran. Firus urged not to travel to Herat or from Herat to other parts of the country. Afghanistan has temporarily closed its border with Iran.\nCases of Covid-19 infection have also been confirmed in Bahrain and KuwaitYeah. The Ministry of Health in Kuwait announced that three people who had returned from the Iranian city of Maschhad to Kuwait had been shown to have the virus. The Bahrain case was also a person who came from Iran to the country, BNA reported.\nTurkey had already closed its border crossings with Iran on Sunday to prevent the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 Coronavirus. Moreover, from 20-hour local time (18-hour MEZ) flights from Iran are no longer expected to land in Turkey, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. This was \"temporary\".

One of the few\nGerman supplier of these materials is the company roof protective clothing in Rastatt. The native Chinese Ming Gutsche has her in the year\n1996 established. Since then, she has left protective clothing like headgear,\nRespiratory masks and gloves are manufactured and sold in Europe. Your\nCustomers are mainly hospitals, rescue services, pharmaceutical companies and the\nFood. Here Gutsche tells how Covid-19 changed her business\nand how full their camp is.\nONLINE TIME: What is the demand for respiratory masks\nReally?\nMing Gutsche: Bigger than ever. Since the company existed,\nWe've never had so many questions. My employees\nThey're all very tired. Me too, I've been getting since the 22nd. January barely\nSleep.\nONLINE TIME: What was special about that day?\nGutsche: Suddenly many trucks were in front of us\nOffice. They were buyers from China, they wanted to buy everything I had in stock\nhat. I thought, oh, there must be really bad conditions in Wuhan\nIf the Chinese want to buy bulky goods in Germany, they will rule. I\ndecided spontaneously not to sell everything now, but to sell the goods\ncontrolled release. Our business is not based on one-time buyers. I\ncould not risk our regular customers, including several German\nHospitals, crumbling. That day I sent all the buyers back\nGone.\nTIME ONLINE: What do you have\nthen done?\nI've been on the phone with my suppliers. Peace.\nquickly became clear that it is only a matter of time before the virus also\nto Germany. I also knew that if the virus is there, we will\nno more goods. We will no longer supply our regular customers\ncaYeah. We have several contractors that we designed\nProduce protective equipment. The one\nPut on masks, the other overalls. Everyone must no longer be allowed to\nproduce foreign market. Police are monitoring the largest factories.\nThe policewomen and policemen even spend the night there. All protective clothing is designed for national needs\nreserved. We were lucky to order a lot of goods\nwhich are already on ships. We will receive them in a few\nTaken. That's all we get.\nTIME ONLINE: What does this mean for your company?\nGutsche: We have to answer thousands of emails every day.\nMany new customers come to us from all over the world. Countless people\norder small quantities, probably just for themselves and their families. But there is also\nsome who want to buy protective masks for two million euros. Also many\nGerman hospitals are among them. But we are not taking any new\nMore customers. After the storm, our webshop collapsed. He shall:\nsynchronized every half hour, but in the meantime so many\nOrders in that our stocks were no longer correct. We must\ncancel lots of orders. And because they've been paid in part,\nWe have to get the money back to the people. This is an enormous amount of extra\nWork. We worked through the first two to three weeks every day. Also\non weekends, twelve to 14 hours a day. At some point we said that\nI can't do it anymore. It's enough if we work ten hours a week.\nTIME ONLINE: How do you decide who else gets protective clothing?\nGutsche: We carefully consider with each customer whether we\nand if so, how much goods he gets. Generally we only operate\nRegular customers, and they prefer hospitals and rescue services. And we\nsee what they bought last year. You will not get more than\notheYeah. That's why every order takes a very long time. Soon we will\nhave much less to do, because then our camp is empty. It's just\nIt's only a matter of time before we can't deliver.\nONLINE TIME: What do you do then?\nGutsche: Probably short work, but this is not yet\nSure. At the moment we still have a lot to do and we do a lot\nOvertime. But of course, without the goods, we're out of work.\nONLINE TIME: Leave also part of the protective clothing\nproduce in Germany?\nGutsche: No. In Germany, protective clothing is scarcely\nSingle use produced. Thirty years ago there was this, but that was then the\nCustomers are too expensive in the long run. I sometimes wonder why in these times\nEverything always has to be as cheap as possible. How to make yourself a\nother country completely dependent.\nTIME ONLINE: Your company has existed for more than 24\nyears. Was the situation with Sars or Ebola similar to today?\nGutsche: No. We've never had a crisis like this before.\nExperience. Avian flu, Ebola, we've seen it all. It's different now. In\nEbola, for example, we had more Unicef, the Federal Armed Forces Hospital, or\nother auxiliary organisations than customers. That wasn't as strenuous as today,\nAt that time we could also let the goods fly in. We have supplies\n(Applause)\nTIME ONLINE: With the avian flu could you still get goods from China?\nGutsche: Yes, back then the barrier did not last that long\nstop. The situation in China was not as dramatic as it is today. We had\nalthough delivery delays, they were able to intercept them. And the customers have the\nhigher prices because of flight costs accepted. I am concerned that the Minister for Health says that we\nare well equipped. We are one of the few suppliers that still deliver\ncan. Hospitals, rescue services, health agencies that steal enquiries\nYes. This means that most competitors can no longer deliveYeah. What?\nWhat happens if we can't deliver in two weeks? Now the\nVirus in Germany and we ourselves no longer have protective clothing. This is\nNot good.\nTIME ONLINE: Sell your products just to higher\nPrices as usual?\nGutsche: Yes, this is inevitable. The material price has\nthe Chinese market will increase dramatically and this will take place in the foreseeable\nDon't change time. We must partly pass on the additional costs to the customers\nCommunity. At Ebola and Sars, our turnover is approximately 40 per cent\nincreased. But when the crisis was over, he broke in again. All\nhad previously covered themselves with security purchases, which then did not\nwere needed. After that, they didn't bring any more products. Now\nCovid-19 is probably different. The products are actually\nused up, at least in hospitals. But what good is it to us now\nTurnover if we have to close the store in two weeks?\nTIME ONLINE: When do you think you will return to normal\ncan?\nGutsche: I expect at least half a year. But\nWe're doing everything we can to be faster.\nTIME ONLINE: What do you recommend to your customers, such as now\nshould proceed?\nGutsche: They should use the products they have,\ncarefully handled and housed. Masks, exceptionally, also more than one\nWear layer as recommended by the RKI. There are certain risks involved.\nBut better than no protection at all",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The covid-2019 satellite, which was launched in Wuhan at the end of last year, continues to spread around the world. Today, it is registered on several continents. However, the who, which has collected all the data, is not in a rush to declare the epidemic. Reporter belta spoke with Vladimir Gorbunov, director of the center for epidemiology and microbiology of the Republic and associate doctor of medical science, Do Belarusians worry too much about what measures can be taken to effectively control the virus?\n-Who announced the covid-2019 emergency. Does this mean Belarusians are too worried? In fact, thousands of people die every year from conventional flu.\n-Disease breaks out in the world from time to time. When new strains of the virus, including influenza, emerge, who declares the situation to be epidemic. Similarly, like coronavirus, it is a new virus for us, so we must take adequate prevention and control measures, In order to reduce its spread.\nIn the case of influenza every year, the population is checked for epidemics: some are immune - or in the past few years after vaccination. Or by slight metastasis of the diseaseAbout In some years, the epidemic is on the rise, while in some years, it is on the rise. As for the common coronavirus, it is relatively rare. Although other versions (not covid-2019) appear regularly, including animals. Other strains have been found in our center from time to time, but they are not widespread. With the emergence of new strains, like the last few years and flu, Who is carrying out organizational and other activities to curb the spread of the disease and is developing recommendations for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.\nBy the way, various coronaviruses circulate between people and epidemics. It can show pharyngitis, bronchitis. It's not always meaningful to decipher and diagnose a pathogen. This has not been done anywhere in the world because the suitability is not very high, the disease has not spread, and it is easy to spread.\n-Know how covid-2019 came out? Is there a known virus mutation? Is it true that bats are all kinds of crown carriers?\n-New crown light sources have not been fully installed, but bats are considered a potential source of transmissioAbout It is a common fact that viruses can be transmitted from animals to humans or, as we say, can overcome interspecific barriers.\n-What is covid-2019 different from other Colorado States? The WHO says it has never encountered the virus before, and in a sense it is unique. What do you mean?\n-The gene analysis of the new virus showed that its structure was consistent with that of other known coronaviruses, the proportion consistent with SARS virus was 85%, and the proportion consistent with mers virus was 15%. It's a combination of genes, it's unique.\n-Most of the infected people have mild illness. The elderly are at the greatest risk, while children are vulnerable to infection. What is this about?\n-The fact that children are more susceptible to disease has been established, but there is no clear explanation. It is believed that the adult tissue structure is more suitable for virus reproduction than the child tissue. In addition, the elderly have more related diseases and chronic diseases than children, which may complicate the occurrence of diseases. This is also true of other infectious diseases, such as influenza.\n-Should people who are afraid of being infected with coronavirus take some kind of medicine to improve their immunity?\n-It's best to ask a clinician or an infected person about this problemAbout However, as far as I know, who has not yet recommended such preventive measures based on the experience of countries with high HIV prevalence. Yes, there are some drugs that can be used for treatment, but there is no point in using them for prevention.\nTell me about typical symptoms. Can a person carry a virus without showing it?\n-Main symptoms - temperature rise, cough, dyspnea, dyspnea. Before symptoms appear, how many diseases a person can infect, and whether he can infect as many diseases without symptoms, remains to be studied.\nWhat is the mechanism of virus transmission? For example, can patients take the same bus or subway car to infect? Or it should be closer contact)（\n-As with influenza, the main route of infection is air-water droplets. In other words, it can be transmitted in public transportation. Of course, close contact with the patient will help the infectioAbout\nIs it reasonable to wear a mask on the street? Or should they just wear in a closed space?\n-As mentioned before, the main route of transmission is air droplet. The mask can prevent the invasion of large droplets and aerosols, Formed when the patient sneezes and coughs. Therefore, it is recommended to put on the mask to the sick people first, so as to prevent them from infecting the people around them, that is, those who take care of the patients. Close contact with the sick)（\nAs for other healthy people, the world health organization does not recommend that they wear masks, which may create the illusion of full protection and divert people's attention. Take other necessary and effective measures. This includes carefully washing hands and keeping a distance (1,5-2m) from anyone who has signs of illness after leaving home and contacting the outside world 2. Avoid visiting densely populated areas without urgent need and take other simple precautions.\nIn addition, the mask should be replaced every two hours, because it will soon get wet, lose efficiency, dyspnea, cause irritation, and cause a certain degree of discomfort. This is because the mask is easy to get wet and uncomfortable. Make people feel worse.\nTherefore, it is generally not recommended to wear masks for healthy people. But every specific situation must also be taken into accountAbout If, for example, you take a bus or a plane, that is to say You're a long-term traveler, and in a limited space, sitting next to you coughing and coughing people, Sneezing should be done with a handkerchief, napkin or, in extreme cases, with an elbow, but not in the palm of your hand It makes sense, of course, to put on a mask.\n-Can coronaviruses be tested before the first symptoms of the disease occur, for example, to avoid transmission to family or friends?\n-In Belarus, autopsies were carried out in China, Iran, Italy and the Republic of Korea over the past 14 days. Who is in close contact with patients with coronavirus infection diagnosed. Others can only be tested in the laboratory with epidemiological and clinical evidence and under the guidance of doctors.\nHowever, we are now seeing a seasonal rise in acute respiratory infections and influenza. While these infections are being monitored, patients with severe respiratory diseases are being examined every year, including the tests we are now doing in ColoradoAbout\n-What kind of diagnosis is in your center? Do I understand correctly that the biomaterials of a potentially contaminated person are studied by several laboratories at the same time? Or is all the material coming into RNA as a lead agency?\n-Materials were studied in one laboratory, but in some cases, such as in quarantine of personnel, they were examined in two independent laboratories to improve reliability. In addition, if the result is positive, test the sample with a set of reagents from another manufacturer.\n-Previously, at a press conference, the national director of Health reported that the results of the coronavirus study obtained by the Belarusian laboratory would be sent to the WHO reference laboratory. What is the purpose of this?\n-There are three types of our centers: domestic production and foreign centers from Russia and the World Health Organization.\nThese diagnostic packages are designed on the basis of modern molecular and biological methods in accordance with who protocols that meet the best international standards. These kits are currently being used around the world.\nSome Republic reference centres and reference laboratories, including the national influenza centre, operate nationwideAbout The regulations of these centres stipulate that biological samples should be exchanged frequently and sent to the WHO reference laboratory, the infection analysis laboratory. This is the daily activity of any reference laboratory.\n-Do I correctly recognize that covid-2019 includes domestic test systems?\n-As soon as the virus spread in China, we started to study this problem. Who places a specific nucleotide sequence on a general visit, This enables us to synthesize so-called raw materials into real-time PDA detection. All countries with relevant laboratories can produce and use a set of reagents. Belarus has no problems in this regard. Our technology is very developed, with high-quality staff. So, since January, we have had our own diagnostic package. The drugs have not yet been registered because registration takes a long time.\nComparing all the samples at home and abroad, we can see their uniqueness. However, the positive results of the Colorado virus were reviewed in all three test systems. So far, there are no differences, which shows that they are exactly the same. In general, we have done a lot of research - more than 5000About\nWe have the technology, we can solve any infection. In Ebola, by the way, we have registered our own research. Check for students from countries where the virus has spread. Fortunately, nothing was planted on our territory at that time.\n-Is there any other diagnostic drug for coronavirus in Belarus?\nYes, we have such drugs, especially a set of coronary gene reagents, \"PCR mode for detecting genetic material of respiratory coronavirus 229E, nl63, betacov 1, hku1. People in clinical materials. That is, technology)（\nThe development of new products and the expansion of production scale depend on the specific situation. Most importantly, we have, develop and support these technologies, and we can produce any new drug to diagnose any infection, no matter what exotic it is.\n-Do experts in your center often study biomaterials of patients who may have other particularly dangerous infectious diseases?\n-Today's world is more transparent than ever, and it's impossible to rule out new exotic infections, including particularly dangerous oneAbout Therefore, we prepare and regularly investigate the disease.\n-In your opinion, what measures need to be taken to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus?\n-Necessary measures have been taken. All of these are based on international experience, which has been tested many times and proved to be effective in dealing with various biological threats（\nAs for the propagation probability of covid-2019, it is. But I believe that the activities of the Ministry of health and other agencies in our country today will help to prevent the large-scale spread of the virus. We have good epidemiological supervision and health services have been strengthened. We track all those who are infected, all those who are in contact, and we are proactive. The World Health Organization also appreciates Belarus's efforts.\n-Will the vaccine being developed become a panacea for coronavirus?\n-My personal view as a microbiologist is that the virus will spread faster in countries than it can develop an effective vaccine. I believe that diseases will happen naturally, such as SARS, mers, etc. However, vaccines must be developed for the futureAbout If it is developed before the next possible coronavirus epidemic, it can be modified to improve the impact of the immune system.\n-What can we predict? In China, when the situation is stable, will covid-2019 continue to spread in China?\nThe prediction of each virus strain is unique. Therefore, even the epidemiologists with world reputation can not answer this question fully and reliably.\nIf we take a look at how this has developed in countries that have become popular before, such as China or Italy, it is predictable. Within one or two months, the incidence will be stable to some extent. So if we have some kind of growth, then in a fairly short period of time, the situation will decline. Although we now have a single case of Colorado virus.\nOf course, there may be different developments, but there are good reasons to say that, like China, we will not have large-scale disease transmission. Climate and population density are affected by various factors. Before we didn't know what SARS and mers were, we were worried about the possible spread of the disease. However, the incidence lasted only a few months. Therefore, it is assumed that the incidence of coronary artery disease and all acute respiratory diseases will decrease in Russia by May JuneAbout\nSvetlana vasilievskaya,\nBeta",

Due to the popularity of covid-19, Moscow has taken restrictive measures: from Monday, students will study remotely and many adults will be transferred to remote jobs. How do we find a new coronavirus, how to treat it, why we need a simple quarantine, Russian News Agency reporter listened to the introduction of the consultant of the scientific work of the central Epidemiology Research Institute of the Russian Federal Health Supervision Bureau and the chief expert of the No. 2 infectious clinical hospital. Academician Victor maleev.\n-According to the latest information, 199 people in Russia have been infected with the new Colorado virus. Why quarantine if the official number of patients is small?\n-There are no more patients. We are not fully quarantined. This is a restrictive measure. If the number of new cases increases, measures must be strengthened. It is not allowed to go out of the house and produce. Everything will freeze. Therefore, efforts are being made to ensure that this does not happen.\nUnfortunately, the incidence is rising. Just a few days ago, we added three or four new patients, yesterday it was 30. Now, we're talking about it, but it could double in the morning. So we have to advance. There could be a fatal result soonAbout\n-The operating room just announced that the 79 year old woman died\nI saw her yesterday. She was complicated by a chronic illness. By the way, this patient is a good example of why isolation and isolation are needed. I mean, she didn't say she was abroad. Apparently, she has connections at home with people from Goa, India. Someone came to visit her - one was not quarantined in time. Unfortunately, this is already a local shift. The second mistake: she left too late. She should be sent to our infection hospital right away. She went to a clinic, and then in the second, and then she came to us.\nWe diagnosed covid-19 and started treatment, but the patient already had complications of chronic diseases. -- reported at the headquarters of disease control this afternoon, The patient died of a large number of bilateral thrombi and pulmonary arteries. - about. Red\n-How to treat covid-19 in Moscow hospital?\nWe use special antiviral drugs. There are instructions on how to treat specific coronaviruses. However, these data are provisional because they are regularly revised based on new infection data. We don't have much experience, including China's. Now I have the seventh version of the Chinese method that they usAbout\nWe also used some drugs that proved effective in the treatment of SARS, because these viruses are 90%. We must give the patients comprehensive intensive drugs. Therefore, if people with many related chronic diseases, such as heart disease, become ill, the heart will be strengthened so that the body can control the infection.\nYou mentioned SARS caused by SARS virus. Its full name is SARS CoV, and the new Colorado State is SARS cov-2. Can we say that this is the same thing in two versions?\n- No. This is a brand new virus. This is 90% of SARS CoV homology, which leads to SARS, but it is quite different. At least no new virus was found in the diagnosis of SARS. Some sars-cov-2 looks like mers, like SARS.\nCould a new coronavirus be artificial?\n- No. In order to produce a new virus, its prototype should not be just a variation)（ In other words, the difference between the RNA of a new virus and its predecessor must be considerable, and there must be many differences. It's impossible. Only nature can do this. We haven't fully studied its full capabilities: why it produces new viruses, where it hides themAbout As we all know, infections are cyclical: they happen, then disappear, and then reappear in a while. It's a time to return, and it's hard to predict if it's not a seasonal infection.\nFor example, SARS was discovered in 2002 at about the same time as the new Colorado virus: November. By the summer of 2003, he was gone. Since then, they have been looking for, they want to find a sick person, but not infected. Why? No one can understand. There are samples of SARS CoV virus isolated from patients and stored in a special laboratory without infection.\n-Will the new coronavirus disappear like SARS?\n-Who knows? This is unpredictable. It's like we can't predict if it's going to be seasonal. You know we're still in the same season for the time being. We should see what will happen next year, and then we can come to a conclusion. We didn't even know he would be in a while.\n-Information can be found on the Internet（ The average temperature there is about the same every year. Is that so?\n-No, because the countries that have found new diseases are in different parallel positions. For example, the situation in Chile and Italy is deteriorating, but they are not exactly the sameAbout\n-May we have a similar situation in Colorado virus in Italy?\nShe won't happen again. We must do everything possible to avoid that in the future. That's why preventive restrictions are being implemented in Moscow. Unfortunately, people are not always able to assess the level of the threat. So, at some point, the government has to take tough action. Then, of course, it can be criticized, although, in my opinion, it is praiseworthy. In any case, Russia - one of the few countries that has succeeded in borders with China over the years - is not letting new infections in.\nYou know, people often ask me: why do we have so few infected people? If China is nearby. My answer: the density of residents in China's border areas is lower than that in Russia and Europe. The main patient is still in Moscow. In the Far East and Siberia, there are no such big cities. There is no such thing as Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. All the patients found in various regions - such as Nizhny Novgorod, Akim - returned from abroad and passed through Moscow.\n-How fast is the coroner?\nFour to eight hoursAbout\nSo now patients' biological samples are not sent to virus and Biotechnology Center vector \"Novosibirsk\"?\n-Now we have Colorado virus test systems everywhere. The analysis was carried out in Moscow before, but because it was the first time, they were considered suspicious, so the samples were sent to Novosibirsk for inspection. Now we only send suspicious results.\nDoes the covid-19 test require a hard filter? Now there have been complaints that doctors have refused to carry out such tests.\nThis makes sense because covid-19 is a medical procedure. Let's say there's no evidence for the X-rays and MRI that everyone wants to do - we don't have enough doctors or equipment. Most people don't need these studies. This is a similar situation. They were afraid and asked to do tests.\nThere's only one coroner that paramedics have to do. It's a procedure that includes bleeding, mucous membranes of the nose and throat. This needs some protection. If you doubt it, you can always call the hotline and tell them. Someone comes to you, maybe they'll analyze the biomaterials, maybe they won'tAbout\nFirst of all, this analysis enables those who come back from abroad to contact them, even if they have no symptoms of coronavirus infection.\nIn addition, the new coronavirus has a sinister ability: it may appear in the body, it will disappear. What do I mean? For example, if the patient is seriously dry, he swallows a lot of things and breathes something, then the virus may not show up in the test. In the test, it already exists. Therefore, the analysis must be modified several times.\n-Excuse me, as an infected person, should the person who contacts with the infected person be fined for violating the quarantine?\nYes, of course. What are they doing? Infect others. Now, everyone is afraid of bacterial weapons, but these contacts, in fact, are real bacterial bombs. Because they work with the virus and spread it. Intentional HIV infection is a punishment. This is the same. People bring unhappiness to society, so they have to take responsibility for it. If we do not punish them, they will continue to act and we will not be able to stop the epidemic.\nYou see, it's very difficult to predict the spread of new infections now, because more cases of coronavirus will be brought to Russia 100%. We have 1800 tourists in MontenegroAbout There are Russians in Spain, Italy, some countries in Germany, where the epidemic situation is complex. This is the great potential of infection in our country. At present, we only have 10 cases of local Colorado virus transfer, people contact with foreign people. We all got them. Next, it all depends on people's consciousness, they will come back. If they stay isolated, see a doctor in time, call a hotline, and if other people don't like the Colorado River, we can deal with the epidemic. Now a lot of things depend on you and me",

Chinese doctors have found that serious heart and vascular problems increase the risk of dying from coronavirus infection by more than four times. Their findings were published in the journal Science, JAMA cardiology.\nWe found a statistically significant association between cardiovascular disorders and mortality in patients with coronavirus infection. In Wuhan, one in five patients has heart and blood vessel problems, which may be the cause of high mortality during hospitalization.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (who), heart and vascular diseases, including heart disease, stroke and chronic heart disease, are still one of the major diseases. The cause of death in the world. About 17 million people die of malaria every year. At the same time, most people have similar problems - hypertension - stable high pressure in the blood vessels.\nAfter the outbreak of a new type of coronavirus in Wuhan, local doctors drew attention to the fact that Chinese people are very likely to suffer from coronavirus. People with old-fashioned or congenital heart disease or vascular disease have more coronavirus than other patientsAbout\nBased on these observations, scientists at Wuhan University observed the frequency of deaths in patients with heart and vascular disease and their healthy peers. There is no such chronic health problem.\nHeart and virus\nDoctors analyzed the medical records of more than 400 Wuhan residents who arrived at a clinic in the city between January 20 and February 10 this year. All of these patients received the same treatment and care, which enabled us to understand the impact of cardiovascular disease on the development of covid-19.\nThese observations suggest that carriers of these problems have a higher virus infection rate than other patients. In particular, they have had symptoms of the disease before, ten times more than the most extreme form of pneumonia. Although these problems affect about 5% of other patients.\nOverall, these differences lead to an average of 4.5 times more deaths from coronavirus infection in patients with chronic heart and vascular disease. Compared with other viral vectors. Overall, about half of the first patients died of infection, while only 4% of the others died of the new coronavirus（\nWhy? Scientists can't say for the momenAbout However, they believe that the virus can interact directly with cardiac muscle cells because there is an ACE2 receptor on its surface.

Molecular biologists in China have found that a new coronavirus that causes the covid-19 pandemic can not only enter human cells through ACE2 receptors, But in other ways - by protein separation of CD147 molecules. The results of the scientists' experiments are published in the biorxiv Electronic Science Library.\n\"We all know that the virus enters the human body with ACE2 receptor. However, because it often appears in heart cells, kidney cells and sexual organs, The fight against the virus through this protein may have a negative impact on these organs. We have isolated receptors that are attacked by another virus molecule, which will expand the library of possible means to contain infection.\nSars-cov-2 virus causes pneumonia in China and other countries, and penetrates human body and other mammalian cells through ACE2 protein molecules, Covering lung cells. Scientists have long found that these larvae play an important role in the life activities of SARS, another dangerous virus, the pathogen of SARS.\nChinese scientists from Xi'an fourth Medical University (Xi'an) and Biotechnology Research Institute (Beijing) found that in order to enter human tissues and cells, covid-19 pathogen is a very likely hallucinogenic agent. Use at least another waAbout This is a CD147 protein receptor.\nScientists discovered the discovery, noting that the SARS virus uses these molecules when it enters human cells and other mammals. In addition, experts have found that these molecules play an important role in controlling other viral infections and malaria. In this spirit, Chinese experts used to inhibit CD147 activity and tried to use sars-cov-2 coronavirus to infect alveolar antibody culture.\nIt turns out that even relatively small concentrations of synthetic antibodies completely prevent the spread of the virus. Later, scientists observed the contaminated cells through an electron microscope, which confirmed that the virus's shell could fuse with CD147. These results show that scientists believe that the drugs developed to protect human beings from malaria and SARS can help prevent and control the sars-cov-2 epidemic.\nRussian federation\nThere are now more than 169000 registered worldwide. It is estimated that in 2001, there were about 6500 new cases of coronavirus infection. Dead, more than 77000 recovered Human beings. Diseases found outside China are in 148 countries, including Russia.\nAt the end of December, a new outbreak of coronavirus (covid-19) broke out in Wuhan, ChinaAbout The World Health Organization recognizes the spread of the disease around the world and calls covid-19 a pandemic.\nThe new type of coronavirus belongs to the same kind of virus as SARS and mers, i.e. SARS and the Middle East mycoplasma. In the past decade, these two viruses have claimed hundreds of lives in the Middle East and East Asia and have repeatedly caused epidemics, Spread through camels and poultry.

The infection has penetrated our country and is now testing the health system in the United States. The authorities are openly optimistic, but privately, many experts doubt that the United States is ready for the challenge.\nAt the same time, America's claim to global leadership has also been tested. It is clear that the threat of this pandemic is that the selfishness of the state must be forgotten for the sake of the common good. Washington has called for at least no harm to Iran and North Korea if it does not help. It is not clear whether he will accept the appeal, but it is clear that they have made a sound of reason.\nSay hello with your elbow\nIn the United States, official data showed 712 cases and 27 deaths as of Tuesday. But on Wednesday, Atlantic magazine warned: \"official statistics are very low, everyone knows.\" According to the magazine, the problem lies in the evaluation method, first of all, the sample testers.\nAt present, it is believed that the infection known as covid-19 has spread to 35 of the 50 states in the United States and the Capital District of ColumbiaAbout This has raised serious concerns, particularly among US lawmakers, with a large proportion of older men. In addition, they often participate in community activities and shake hands with each other. Although in Washington, D.C., so-called social distance has become a pattern, including using elbows instead of contact.\nAt the end of February, many leading Republican politicians in the United States attended the traditional annual meeting of the conservative political action committee. Later, it was found that one of the guests at the event was infected with coronavirus. Moreover, according to the political daily, he is a very sociable person with access to almost all places, including the conference room, where participants wait for their turn to speak.\nSo now some of the other guests, including Senator Ted Cruz and at least five members of Congress, have announced that they will take preventive measures to segregate their families. These include the transition from Congress to White House chief of staff mark meadows and at least one lawmaker, Recent personal contacts with the chairman of the open ended Working GrouAbout\nSome members of Congress have passed the coronavirus screening just in case, although according to them, no one has any symptoms. It is understood that although both spoke to the Conservatives in the same forum, neither the tram party nor its vice president, Michael burns, was subject to such scrutiny.

For example, the New York Times ran a large article to the effect that he didn't know how to deal with the virus of an invisible killer. The leadership comfort role has made it difficult for him to find a balance between confident confidence and naive hat, \"said the president's rival newspaper.\nBy the way, Washington Examiner, an online version of a cute white house boss, criticizes him for his lack of persuasive surface optimism. The title of the drafting commentary on this topic is \"in order to prevent the panic caused by coronavirus, it is possible for French marine reserves to intensify this panic\"About\nWe can recall that at the beginning, American leaders expressed their belief that with the warm weather, the spread of infection will inevitably disappear. He claimed that the threat of the epidemic was deliberately provoked by his political opponents. But when trump publicly called it the opposition's next scam, it met with such a strong and unanimous opposition that he no longer repeated that definition.\nOn the whole, the tension between American politicians is growing.

One of her Democratic colleagues completely closed her capital office and went home to quarantine after she was found in a photo with the virus carrier on the c-pac forum.\nThe threat of this century?\nThe assessment of the US health authorities is inconsistent. They don't seem to have found a balance. On the one hand, of course, they can't underestimate the threat. On the other hand, they obviously want to emphasize that the devil is not as terrible as people portrayAbout\nAs a result, the main relevant national agency, the Centers for Disease Control（ \"The virus is likely to cause a pandemic.\" However, he noted, \"for most people, the direct risk of exposure to the virus is low.\". Jerome Adams, chief surgeon of the United States, stressed that for children and young people, covid-19 \"is not as lethal as flu.\".\nIn this case, U.S. health authorities continue to call on healthy people not to wear masks. Although the mention of the virus is in vain, it is not very logical. If so, why keep the mask for the medical staff and staff who care for the patient?  \nThe dual position of the authorities forces us to seek external assessments. Bill Gates, one of the richest people in the world, is a leading American philanthropist in the field of medicine The UK points out that the new corona rose has begun to behave quite similar to the once-in-a-century pathogens we are worried about. \"\n\"I hope it's not that bad, but before proving the opposite, we have to start from that, that is, we have to start from that.\" At worst, he stresseAbout Gates reported that his family philanthropy foundation is ready to spend $100 million to fight covid-19. He noted that a large part of these funds would be used to provide substantive assistance to poor countries. Because they are often the first pillar in identifying and responding to the threat of a common epidemic.\nKurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, and Thomas Wright, a political scientist at the Brooklyn Institute in Washington, D.C., also believe that covid-19 could be a century old threat. \" \"One of the most serious peace crises in modern history.\" Together with the heinous terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 and the financial collapse of 2008, they warned that the consequences of the crisis could be worse. \"\nAnother example is that they put the issue primarily in a political context and proved it to be a nationalistic border as a public management approach. \" Experience is important, institutions are important, the author wrote. This is a matter for the international community. An open answer, even if it's not welcome, makes sense. The system must be re run. \"\nI'm not the king. \"\nThe sharpness of this criticism is aimed at the springboard and its main slogan: \"make America great again\"About In general, in the context of the discussion of the impending dangers of the United States, a typical question is now being asked more and more often - who is the culprit?\nThe most common answer can also be considered classic: Of course, it's easiest to prove the bureaucracy of the past. \"\nLisa Monaco, a former adviser to former Democratic President Barack Obama on national security and counter-terrorism, proudly reports in a few days' Foreign Affairs magazine, In January 2017, he personally held a simulation exercise for the new springboard team to cope with a global pandemic caused by a new virus, U.S. Defense Forces (i.e. the U.S. defense forces, which replace their subordinates on the National Security Council). The significance of reminders is understandable: we all foresee in advance that the necessary plans and structures have been established, rather than our mistakes, if they are not used.\nIn general, springboard now has many people complaining that it has dismantled the anti epidemic device built under its predecessor, which not only includes the subordinate units of the National Security Bureau, But the Department of homeland security. As early as late January, the Journal of foreign policy wrote this article, accusing the current president of \"destroying his country and setting him as an example to Obama, \"Ronald Klein, former chief of staff of Vice President Joseph Biden.About\nAnother thing is that the back of the head is still robust, and the effect of past measures is questionable. Klein himself said at the Aspen Institute meeting in Washington in February that despite his resounding title, he had no real impact. My experience is \"King Ebola\"（ \"In the vast majority of cases, I'm not the king because we don't have a health command system in the United States,\" he said\nThere is no vertical. \"\nIn fact, experts generally agree that the health care structure in the United States has been and remains fragmented. There is no real \"vertical authority\" that can ensure a coordinated response across the country to the threat of the epidemic. Yes, what is the administrative vertical line: there is no right to sick leave in federal law, so there are some mistakes in Congress.\nIn general, system defects. The most obvious and poignant evidence is that 27.5 million Americans lack health insurance), which is 8.5% of the population. In the 2011 postmark, the index rose again. He has been declining for several years since he passed the Obama health plan act in 2010. About\nThe question is understandable: if uninsured people start to get sick, who will pay for their treatment? The hospital warned in advance that it would be devastating for them and could lead to bankruptcy. In 2007, the Journal of health finance published a study. According to this view, if there is another disaster like the 1918 influenza Spanish pandemic, US medical institutions will suffer 3.9 billion US dollars in losses. Hospitals with an average of $784592.\nBy the way, tramp recently said it was news that he might have died of flu. Although his grandfather died in 1918 in the same Spanish woman's father, Friedrich Trapp.\nEconomic background of elections\nThere is also a classic question, what should we do? \"They tried to drown the fire with money,\" the American replied in a familiar way The White House initially called for a $2.5 billion crackdown on covid-19, and lawmakers were afraid to allocate $8.3 billion. \" \"Well, I think that,\" said trump, who signed the bill last Friday with more than 100000 patients worldwide. Human beings.\nFor the White House and its owners, the economy is number oneAbout \"A key publication that the U.S. presidential information service has been focusing on in recent days is CNBC television, Moreover, under the threat of Colorado, \"employment growth in the country continues to exceed expectations,\" and the unemployment rate fell again to 3.5% in February. The emphasis on this theme is understandable: as far as the Preparatory Committee is concerned, it is directly related to the prospects for the re-election of the president in November.\nPlans developed within the framework of the fight against covid-19 fall within the same objective. Most importantly, the banking Union has urged the Federal Reserve System to continue to loosen monetary policy to stimulate the country's economic growth.\nAmong the government's stimulus measures, according to news reports, the president gave priority to tax cuts. In his view, these measures should include payroll taxes and come into force by the end of the year, at least before elections.\nHowever, these plans have not been completed. As we all know, American lawmakers have not supported this idea in the past. Now the opposition in Congress is pushing its agendAbout According to politico, \"Democrats are preparing legislation that will provide free Colorado virus testing and strengthen unemployment insurance, \"During the break, students who receive free food at school can continue to receive it and take paid sick leave.\"\nSwitch\nWhen it comes to covid-19, U.S. analysts and the press often try to move the perpetrators to China where the outbreak occurred. For example, a commentary in the Journal of national interests recently said: \"chaos created in China can be avoided.\" At the same time, there are also attempts to denigrate the World Health Organization, which is said to have facilitated Beijing and highly appreciates its efforts to fight AIDS.\nBut the response to such attacks is clear. Now, let's see whose system is better at responding to threats. China, who can buy it in Wuhan City, greatly exceeds the population of New York City - or the United States.\nAs long as the latter's action, at least, does not affect the imagination. Bloomberg introduced an incident at the University of California Medical Center, Transporting an infected patient there forced more than 120 staff members to quarantinAbout The National Union of nurses and nurses (the National Union of nurses and nurses) saw the incident as a systematic failure.\nJust today, Atlantis published an article saying, \"the failed Colorado virus test in the United States.\" According to its exclusive source, the magazine claims that so far, only 1895 people have been tested domestically. \" In the case of C [virus], H1N1 and Zika CDC performed well and distributed a large number of test packages to the whole country, -Thomas Frieden, former director of the Centers for disease control, told the magazine. \"I don't know what's wrong this time.\"\nDesperate\nGenerally speaking, experts and many observers understand that the US authorities should always reflect on themselves before trying to blame others. We'd better not put the blame on others, but try to cooperate internationally with all people without exception.\nThis is Bill Gates' call, this is his article in Campbell and Wright, Atlantis. \"Should help the enemy\" - experts stressed. -To this end, the United States and other countries can consider temporarily suspending certain sanctions against vulnerable countries such as Iran and North Korea, Control the virus if necessary. \"\nI asked my friends in the Ministry of foreign affairs if they had done any concrete work in this regard.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (Reuters) - Extending school and work closures at the coronavirus’ ground zero in China may delay a second wave of infections, researchers said on Thursday, urging the rest of the world to take note.\nWith containment measures largely successful and the epidemic’s epicenter now in Europe, China has loosened a two-month lockdown in the city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.\nBut a study in The Lancet Public Health journal suggested continuing Wuhan’s shutdowns until April would push a potential second wave of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. That would give health services more time to recover and expand, potentially saving lives.\n“The city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases,” said Kiesha Prem, a specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who co-led the research.\n“If they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.”\nThe study used mathematical modeling to simulate either extending or relaxing school and workplace closures in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people whose name has become synonymous with the coronavirus for much of the world.\nBy lifting control measures now, a second rush of infections may occur in late August, the analysis suggested. But keeping lockdown measures until April would likely delay a second peak until October — giving healthcare workers a chance to regroup.\nThose findings were “crucial for policy makers everywhere”, said Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London, who was not directly involved in the study.\nStunned by the disease’s rapid spread, governments around the world are trying to replicate China’s draconian lockdown measures while also working out the risk of recurrences once the epidemic peaks have passed in their countries.\n“Our results won’t look exactly the same in another country,” said Yang Liu, an LSHTM expert who also worked on the research. “But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection ... If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.”\nWorld Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday expressed the same view, saying lockdowns were the best way to curb transmission.\n“The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,” he said.\n",

Hospitals in cities including New York and New Orleans are struggling to cope with the wave of patients.\nTrump said China had sent virus data to U.S. scientists and was sending more after he and Xi spoke by telephone.\n“We talked about the experience that they had in China and all the things that have taken place. And we learned a lot,” Trump told reporters.\n“They have had a very tough experience. And they are doing well ... President Xi is doing very well. We learned a lot and we have great communication together.”\nXi’s offer of assistance follows a war of words between Beijing and Washington over various issues, including the pandemic. Trump and other U.S. officials have accused Beijing of a lack of transparency over the outbreak, and Trump has referred to coronavirus as the “Chinese virus” because it originated there late last year.\nAccording to an account of the conversation published by the Chinese foreign ministry, Xi reiterated to Trump that China had been open and transparent.\n“We are working closely together,” Trump said on Twitter. “Much respect!”\nWuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated in a seafood market and which had been on lockdown for more than two months, was open to incoming traffic late on Friday, although cars were not allowed to leave.\nHubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, removed border restrictions on Wednesday for all but Wuhan, which will allow people to leave the city starting on April 8.\nAt a checkpoint entering the city on Friday night, three lanes were open to traffic but there were few cars, with a lone figure in military fatigues standing at each lane checking the mobile phone health codes of arriving passengers.\nAlong the highway entering the city of 11 million, blue and white signs pointed traffic to the now-closed Huoshenshan Hospital, which was built in eight days and opened in early February and came to symbolise China’s aggressive management of the outbreak after a fumbled early effort.\nOther evidence of the outbreak that devastated the city included posters dated Feb. 16 seeking volunteers to help battle the epidemic.\n“Exits out of the city are still shut. We respectfully ask for your understanding,” one road sign along the highway said.\nNumerous people have been trapped inside and outside of Wuhan and Hubei and many of the cars entering the city had Wuhan number plates, indicating they were returning residents.\nThe World Health Organization has said the United States is expected to become the pandemic’s new epicentre.\nLike U.S. hospitals now, China’s medical system struggled to contain the coronavirus two months ago, but draconian city lockdowns and severe travel restrictions have seen the crisis  ease.\nMainland China on Friday reported its first local coronavirus case in three days and 54 new imported cases, as Beijing ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights, for fear travellers could reignite the outbreak.\nThe 55 new cases detected on Thursday were down from 67 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said, taking the tally of infections to 81,340. China’s death toll stood at 3,292 as of Thursday, up by five from a day earlier.\nHubei, with a population of about 60 million, reported no new cases on Thursday.\nChina’s commercial capital of Shanghai reported the most new imported cases with 17, followed by 12 in the southern province of Guangdong and four each in the capital Beijing and the nearby city of Tianjin.\nShanghai now has 125 patients who arrived from overseas, including 46 from Britain and 27 from the United States.\nIn effect from Sunday, China has ordered its airlines to fly only one route to any country, on just one flight each week. Foreign airlines must comply with similar curbs on flights to China, although many had already halted services.\nAbout 90% of current international flights into China will  be suspended, cutting arrivals to 5,000 passengers a day, from 25,000, the civil aviation regulator said late on Thursday.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - Struck down by coronavirus at the age of 83, the long life of Alfredo Visioli ended with a short ceremony at a graveyard near Cremona, his hometown in northern Italy.\n“They buried him like that, without a funeral, without his loved ones, with just a blessing from the priest,” said his granddaughter Marta Manfredi who couldn’t attend. Like most of the old man’s family - like most of Italy - she was confined to her home.\n“When all this is over,” she vows, “we will give him a real funeral.”\nEverywhere the coronavirus has struck, regardless of culture or religion, ancient rituals to honor the dead and comfort the bereaved have been cut short or abandoned for fear of spreading it further.\nThe virus, which has killed nearly 9,000 people worldwide, is reshaping many aspects of death, from the practicalities of handling infected bodies to meeting the spiritual and emotional needs of those left behind.\nIn Ireland, the health authority is advising mortuary workers to put face masks on dead bodies to reduce even the minor risk of infection. In Italy, a funeral company is using video links to allow quarantined families to watch a priest bless the deceased. And in South Korea, fear of the virus has caused such a drop in the number of mourners that funeral caterers are struggling for business.\nThere is little time for ceremony in hard-hit cities such as Bergamo, northeast of Milan, where the mortuaries are full and the crematorium is working around the clock, said Giacomo Angeloni, a local official in charge of cemeteries.\nBergamo, home to about 120,000 people, has been dealing with 5-6 times the number of dead it would in normal times, he said.\nItaly has now reported nearly 3,000 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus - the highest outside China where the virus first emerged. The Italian army sent 50 troops and 15 trucks to Bergamo on Wednesday to take bodies to less overwhelmed provinces.\nA ban on gatherings has shattered the vital rituals that help us grieve, said Andy Langford, the chief operating officer of Cruse Bereavement Care, a British charity providing free care and counseling to those in grief.\n“Funerals allow a community to come together, express emotion, talk about that person and formally say goodbye,” he said.\n“When you feel you have no control over how you can grieve, and over how you can experience those last moments with someone, that can complicate how you grieve and make you feel worse,” he said.\nIn Iran as in northern Italy, hospital and funeral workers are overwhelmed with bodies, as the virus has torn across the country, killing 1,284 people and infecting thousands, according to state TV.\nThe authorities have hired new people to dig graves, said a manager at Tehran’s Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. “We work day and night,” he said. “I have never seen such a sad situation. There are no funerals.”\nMost corpses arrive by truck and are buried without the ritual washing that Islam dictates, he said.\nSome Iranians suspect that the official haste to bury them has more to do with obscuring the spiraling death toll than halting the spread of the virus.\nDeaths from COVID-19 have been recorded as heart attacks or lung infections, a hospital worker in Kashan, a city about a three-hour drive from Tehran, told Reuters.\n“The officials are lying about the death toll,” the worker said. “I have seen dozens of corpses in the past few days, but they have told us not to talk about it.” Two nurses at Iranian hospitals also told Reuters they thought the death toll was higher than the official tally.\nIranian authorities have rejected allegations of a cover-up, and President Hassan Rouhani, in a televised speech on Mar. 18, said his government had been “honest and straightforward with the nation.”\nIn several countries, clusters of infection have followed funerals. In South Korea, where more than 90 people have died, the government has urged the families of COVID-19 victims to cremate their loved ones first, and hold the funeral later.\nKorean funerals usually take place in hospitals, and involve three days of prayers and feasting. Most of the country’s early cases were linked to a church in Daegu city and a hospital in a nearby county. In February, several members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus attended a funeral at the hospital for the brother of the church’s founder.\nSince the outbreak, the number of mourners at funerals has plunged by 90%, regardless of whether the deceased had the virus, said Choi Min-ho, secretary general of the Korea Funeral Association.\n“The culture of funerals has changed significantly,” he said. “A handful of mourners quickly offer condolences and leave the place without dining together out of infection worries.”\nCondolence money, traditionally handed over in cash, is now sent via bank transfer, he added.\nAuthorities in Wuhan, the epicenter of China’s outbreak and location of the majority of its deaths, quickly identified the funeral business as a potential source of transmission.\nThe local civil affairs bureau in late January ordered all funerals for confirmed COVID-19 victims to be handled at a single funeral home in the city’s Hankou district. Mourning ceremonies, usually boisterous social events in China, were curtailed along with all other public gatherings.\nThose restrictions are still in place, even though the number of new cases has dwindled in recent weeks. Bereaved families are not even allowed to see the bodies of their loved ones, a worker at the funeral home told Reuters.\nIn China, the ashes of the deceased tend to be kept in funeral homes until they are taken to a family plot on public holidays such as the Tomb Sweeping Festival in April. That’s also canceled this year.\nIn Spain, too, a large cluster of cases has been traced to a funeral in the northern town of Vitoria in late February. At least 60 people who attended tested positive after the event, said local media reports.\nWith over 600 deaths, Spain is the second-worst hit country in Europe after Italy, and most people are now confined to their homes. Referring to these restrictions, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called coronavirus a “cruel” disease that paralyses the human need to socialize.\nIn Ireland, up to 100 guests are still allowed at all funerals - for now. But most families are opting for small private ceremonies and encouraging others to express their condolences online through websites such as RIP.ie, where death notices and funeral invitations are usually posted.\nOpen casket funerals are out for any victim of coronavirus, and “the family should be advised not to kiss the deceased,” according to new guidelines from Ireland’s Health and Safety Executive to its funeral directors.\nThe risk of catching coronavirus from a dead body is slim, public health officials say, but some countries are recommending extra measures.\nIsrael has reported no coronavirus deaths, but its health ministry says the deceased should be double-wrapped in impermeable plastic. Ritual washing and rites will be performed in full protective gear and the corpse re-wrapped in plastic for burial. Normally Israel’s Jewish dead are laid to rest in a cloth smock and shroud.\nIreland’s guidelines advise workers in funeral parlors to put face masks on dead bodies before moving them, in case they “expel a very small amount of air and viral droplets from the lungs” and infect the living.\nIn Britain, where the pandemic is still gathering pace, there is widespread anxiety about the likely death toll.\nBritain has been slower in implementing the strict measures seen elsewhere in Europe, and expert estimates of how many will die from COVID-19 have ranged wildly from the tens to the hundreds of thousands.\nAn emergency bill to tackle the virus, which has killed 104 people in Britain, includes a number of measures the government says will “streamline the death management process.” The measures include allowing funeral directors to register a death on behalf of a self-isolating family.\nDeborah Smith, a spokesperson for the National Association of Funeral Directors, said the bill will help the profession “preserve the dignity of those who die and care for their bereaved families with compassion - even if they are not able to have the kind of funeral they would have wanted.”\nSmith would not be drawn on the expected numbers, but said “funeral directors are preparing for a variety of scenarios.”\nOne scenario is already playing out in Wuhan.\nLast month, a worker at the funeral home in Hankou district, identifying himself only as Huang, wrote an essay that was circulated on social media. He said funeral workers were as overwhelmed as the city’s medics but had received less recognition.\nHe said staff had worked without a break since the start of the epidemic. “Some of our employees don’t even drink water because they need to go to the toilet and it’s difficult to take off the protective clothing,” he wrote.\nHalf a world away, in the virus-stricken Italian town of Bergamo, funeral workers wage a near-identical struggle.\n“It’s like being in a war with an invisible enemy,” said Roberta Caprini, a partner in Centro Funerario Bergamasco, a funeral service in Bergamo. “We’ve been working without interruption for two weeks and sleeping 3-4 hours a night when we manage it. Everyone in our area, us included, has lost someone or have someone sick in their home.”\nBergamo’s Church of All Saints has become a makeshift mortuary, its pews pushed aside to accommodate the dead. Caprini said she had counted at least 60 coffins when she visited on Tuesday.\nShe spoke of the “real torture” felt by families who watched sick relatives taken away to hospital and never saw them again. Her company has arranged video links to burials, to allow families to watch the priest bless the deceased.\nSometimes, she said, they drive the hearses past the bereaved family’s home, so mourners “can at least come down at the moment and offer a quick prayer.”\n(This story has been refiled to fix the bylines)\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "（路透社）-阿尔弗雷多·维奥利83岁时被冠状病毒击倒，他在意大利北部的家乡克雷莫纳附近的墓地举行了一个简短的仪式，结束了他漫长的生命。\n他无法出席的孙女玛尔塔·曼弗雷迪说：“他们就这样埋葬了他，没有葬礼，没有亲人，只有牧师的祝福。”。像老人家的大多数人一样，像意大利的大多数人一样，她被关在家里。\n“等这一切结束，”她发誓，“我们会给他一个真正的葬礼。”\n在冠状病毒肆虐的每一个地方，不管是文化还是宗教，为纪念死者和安慰死者家属而举行的古老仪式都被缩短或废弃，以免进一步传播。\n该病毒已在全球范围内造成近9000人死亡，它正在改变死亡的许多方面，从处理受感染尸体的实际情况到满足留守者的精神和情感需求。\n在爱尔兰，卫生局建议太平间工作人员在尸体上戴上口罩，以降低即使是轻微的感染风险。在意大利，一家殡仪公司正在使用视频链接，允许被隔离的家庭观看牧师为死者祝福。而在韩国，对病毒的恐惧导致送葬人数的下降，以至于殡仪服务商都在为生意苦苦挣扎。\n负责墓地的当地官员吉亚科莫·安杰洛尼说，在米兰东北部的贝尔加莫等重灾城市，几乎没有时间举行仪式，那里的太平间已经爆满，火葬场24小时都在工作。\n他说，贝加莫是大约12万人的家园，目前处理的死亡人数是平时的5-6倍。\n目前，意大利已报告近3000人死于冠状病毒引起的COVID-19，这是该病毒首次出现的中国以外地区死亡人数最多的国. 意大利军队星期三派出50名士兵和15辆卡车前往贝加莫，将尸体运往不太拥挤的省份。\n英国慈善机构Cruse丧亲关怀的首席运营官Andy Langford说，禁止集会打破了帮助我们悲伤的重要仪式。\n他说：“葬礼可以让一个群体聚在一起，表达情感，谈论那个人，正式地说再见。”。\n他说：“当你觉得自己无法控制如何悲伤，也无法控制如何与某人共度最后时刻，这会使你的悲伤变得复杂，让你感觉更糟。”。\n据伊朗国家电视台报道，伊朗和意大利北部一样，医院和殡仪馆的工作人员都被尸体压垮，病毒已经在全国蔓延，造成1284人死亡，数千人感染。\n德黑兰Behesht-e Zahra公墓的一位经理说，当局雇用了新的人来挖掘坟墓。“我们日夜工作，”他说。“我从未见过如此悲惨的局面。没有葬礼。”\n他说，大多数尸体是用卡车运来的，埋葬时没有按照伊斯兰教规定的仪式清洗。\n一些伊朗人怀疑，官方急于埋葬他们，更多的是为了掩盖不断上升的死亡人数，而不是阻止病毒的传播。\n距德黑兰约三小时车程的卡山市一名医院工作人员告诉路透社记者，从COVID-19死亡的记录是心脏病发作或肺部感染。\n“官员们在死亡人数上撒谎，”这名工人说。伊朗医院的两名护士还告诉路透社，他们认为死亡人数高于官方统计数字。\n伊朗当局拒绝了有关掩盖真相的指控，伊朗总统鲁哈尼在3月18日的电视讲话中说，伊朗政府“对国家诚实和坦率.”\n在一些国家，葬礼之后出现了成簇的感染。在韩国，已经有90多人死亡，政府敦促19名遇难者的家属先火化他们的亲人，然后再举行葬礼。\n韩国的葬礼通常在医院举行，包括三天的祈祷和宴会。该国早期的病例大多与大邱市的一座教堂和附近一个县的一家医院有关。今年2月，耶稣新禅宗教会的几名成员在医院参加了该教会创立者兄弟的葬礼。\n韩国殡葬协会秘书长崔敏浩说，自疫情爆发以来，无论死者是否携带病毒，参加葬礼的悼念者人数已经下降了90%。\n他说：“葬礼文化发生了重大变化。“为数不多的悼念者迅速表示哀悼，出于对感染的担忧，离开这里不一起吃饭。”\n他补充说，传统上以现金形式交付的慰问金现在通过银行转账。\n武汉是中国爆发疫情的中心，也是其死亡的主要地点，当局很快将殡葬业确定为潜在的传染源。\n当地民政局1月下旬下令，所有已确认的COVID-19遇难者的葬礼都在汉口区的一家殡仪馆办理。哀悼仪式，通常是中国喧闹的社会活动，随着所有其他公众集会而减少。\n尽管最近几周新病例的数量有所减少，但这些限制仍在实施。殡仪馆的一名工作人员告诉路透社记者，死者家属甚至不允许看到亲人的尸体。\n在中国，死者的骨灰一般会保存在殡仪馆，直到在4月份的清明节等公共假日被带到家庭墓地。今年也取消.\n在西班牙，也有大量病例被追查到2月下旬在北部城镇维托利亚举行的葬礼。据当地媒体报道，至少60名参加活动的人在活动结束后检测呈阳性。\n西班牙有600多人死亡，是欧洲仅次于意大利的第二大受灾国家，现在大多数人只能呆在家里。在提到这些限制时，佩德罗·桑切斯总理称冠状病毒是一种“残忍”的疾病，它使人类社交需求瘫痪。\n在爱尔兰，到目前为止，所有的葬礼仍允许100名宾客参加。但大多数家庭选择举行小型私人仪式，并鼓励其他人通过RIP.ie等网站在网上表达哀悼，这些网站通常张贴死亡通知和葬礼请柬。\n根据爱尔兰健康与安全管理局（Health and Safety Executive）给葬礼负责人的最新指导方针，任何冠状病毒感染者都将举行开棺式葬礼，“应该建议家属不要亲吻死者”。\n公共卫生官员说，从尸体上感染冠状病毒的风险很小，但一些国家建议采取额外措施。\n以色列没有报告冠状病毒死亡，但其卫生部说，死者应该用不透水的塑料双层包装。仪式清洗和仪式将在全套保护装备和尸体重新包装在塑料埋葬。通常，以色列的犹太死者被安置在布罩衫和裹尸布中休息。\n爱尔兰的指导方针建议殡仪馆的工作人员在移动尸体前给尸体戴上口罩，以防他们“从肺部排出极少量的空气和病毒液滴”，感染活人。\n在大流行仍在加速的英国，人们普遍担心可能造成的死亡人数。\n英国在执行欧洲其他地方的严格措施方面进展缓慢，专家估计有多少人将死于COVID-19，范围从几万到几十万不.\n一项应对该病毒的紧急法案在英国已经导致104人死亡，其中包括一些政府称将“简化死亡管理程序”的措施。这些措施包括允许殡仪馆馆长代表一个自我隔离的家庭登记死亡。\n全国殡葬协会发言人黛博拉·史密斯（Deborah Smith）表示，这项法案将帮助殡葬业“保护那些死去的人的尊严，用同情之心照顾他们的亲人——即使他们无法举行他们想要的那种葬礼。”\n史密斯不愿透露预期数字，但表示“殡仪馆馆长正在为各种情况做准备”\n一个场景已经在武汉上演。\n上个月，汉口区殡仪馆一名自称黄姓的工作人员写了一篇文章，在社交媒体上流传。他说，殡仪馆的工作人员和市里的医护人员一样不知所措，但得到的认可较少。\n他说，疫情开始以来，工作人员一直在不间断地工作。他写道：“我们的一些员工甚至不喝水，因为他们需要上厕所，很难脱下防护服。”。\n半个世界之外，在病毒肆虐的意大利小镇贝加莫，殡仪馆工作人员进行了一场几乎相同的斗争。\n“这就像是在与一个看不见的敌人交战，”贝加莫葬礼服务中心的合伙人罗伯塔·卡普里尼说。“我们已经连续两周不间断地工作，每天晚上睡3-4个小时。我们这一地区的每个人，包括我们在内，都有人在家里失去亲人或生病。”\n贝尔加莫的万圣教堂已经变成了一个临时停尸房，它的长椅被推到一边以容纳死者。卡普里尼说，她在星期二参观时至少数了60具棺材。\n她谈到那些看着生病的亲属被送往医院却再也没有见到他们的家庭所感受到的“真正的折磨. 她的公司已经安排了与葬礼相关的视频链接，让家人观看牧师为死者祈福。\n她说，有时候，他们会把灵车开过死者家属的家，所以吊唁者“至少现在可以下来，快速祈祷”\n（这篇文章被重新引用以修复署名",

        "news_content_translate_en": "XIANNING, China (Reuters) - Residents of China’s Xianning city eager to travel after a two-month lockdown faced an unexpected hurdle only hours after the borders were opened — they needed to pass a new rapid detection test to show they didn’t have the coronavirus.\nDozens rushed to the city’s largest hospital but were told the hospital was no longer doing the nucleic acid tests and were advised to try hospitals in nearby villages or towns.\nThe test uses genetic material from throat swabs and normally takes a few hours for a result.\n“If we can’t get the nucleic acid test how can we leave? I can’t get on the train, I’ve bought my ticket but I can’t leave,” Shen Jianning, 51, said on Thursday morning.\nShen, who wants to return to his job on a metro construction project in Shanghai, rushed to Xianning Central Hospital at around 4 a.m. on Thursday in hopes of getting a nucleic acid test, but was told by doctors there that they no longer were doing the tests and he had to find an alternative.\nSigns pasted on glass doors of the hospital, the city’s largest, said people should go to village or town hospitals to get the tests done.\nXianning announced the test requirement on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, the day Hubei province, epicenter of China’s coronavirus outbreak and home to 60 million people, removed much of its lockdown transport measures.\nThe lifting of the Hubei lockdown is a major milestone in the fight against the coronavirus in China. More than 80% of COVID-19 cases and 96% of deaths in mainland China have been in Hubei.\nThe provincial capital Wuhan, where the virus first appeared late last year and which has had 54% of cases, remains under lockdown until April 8.\nThe order to use the rapid-detection test came after news that a man who had traveled from the city last week had later tested positive when he returned to work in Guangdong province.\nThe lifting of the lockdown has been accompanied by both relief and worry, with several people in Xianning telling Reuters they were unnerved by the case of the man who had traveled to Guangdong.\n“My Shanghai boss has called me a few times asking me to get out as soon as possible. He even prepared the proof of work resumption for me. He told me what processes you need to do we will help you, just think of a way to get out,” Shen said.\nShen, from the eastern province of Jiangsu, had been trapped in Xianning after traveling to the city to see a house he had bought there.\nMillions of people were caught in Hubei or stuck outside it as China imposed draconian measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, an approach that has proven effective, with reported new domestically transmitted cases falling to zero on most recent days, even as imported cases persist.\nOn Thursday morning, about 30 people queued outside Xianning Central Hospital, all of them required to complete a form declaring whether they had recently come back from overseas or been in any high risk areas.\nSome in the queue said they were lining up for a nucleic test, but were unclear where they could get it done. A number were trying to get back to Guangdong province to work.\n“I saw on Douyin that a few hundred people came here yesterday, there were lots of people,” said He Ting, referring to the Chinese version of TikTok.\nShe has been stuck in Xianning since Lunar New Year in January and was trying to get back to her job in the southwestern city of Chengdu, in Sichuan province, and was also unable to get the test at the hospital\n“I’m trying to figure out another way,” she said.\nAt the Xianning Yongan Health Service Centre, a community health center, more than a hundred people milled in and outside its gates. A long queue snaked with people clutching paper slips with numbers on them. Some said they were told that results would take a day or two.\n“I came here to queue but they told me I needed to register and then wait for a call on when it’s my turn,” said a man as he got on his electric scooter to leave.\n“I need to get back to my job in Dongguan. But now I don’t know when I can leave.”\n",

The CPPCC, a largely ceremonial advisory body, runs in parallel.\nDuring parliament, legislators pass laws and unveil economic targets, defence spending projections and other important policy decisions. It is also an occasion for China’s ruling Communist Party to announce major policy and personnel changes.\nThis year, the NPC is expected to discuss the recent months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, with China’s economy also expected to be a key item on the agenda.\nChina’s factory production plunged at the sharpest pace in 30 years in the first two months of the year due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus, data on Monday showed.\nUrban investment and retail sales also fell sharply and for the first time ever.\nThe health ministry said last week China had passed the peak of its the coronavirus epidemic. As locally transmitted cases plunge, most new reported cases in recent days have been imported, according to government data. (Reporting by Beijing newsroom Editing by Tony Munroe, Robert Birsel)\n",

China responded to the goodwill gesture with gratitude.\nThe Chinese foreign ministry said that India's acts demonstrate its friendship with China.\nAlthough India and China on earlier occasions have come to the rescue of their nationals in distress in respective countries, the evacuation of Indian nationals from Wuhan is unprecedented in recent history.\nThe message of the evacuation exercise is very clear: The two countries being neighbours, it is only prudent to learn to live with each other.\nThe bottom line is mutual sensitivity and concerns.\nHopefully, the covid-19 will pass sooner than later.\nThe two countries will have to work hard to execute and implement the slew of events lined up in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relations.\nIndia also reached out to the SAARC fraternity during this period of the virus outbreak.\nHe also said that India was assembling a rapid response eam of doctors and specialists, along with testing kits and other equipment, to be made available to member countries, if required.\nThe proposal has been fructified and has received immediate traction.\nIn response to Prime Minister Modi's appeal, both Bhutan and Nepal each have pledged $1 million to the emergency corpus.\nIndia in the meanwhile has received requests from member countries for assistance in the form of masks, shoe cover, gloves, disinfectants and other items.\nPrime Minister Modi also held a telephonic conversation with Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, which now holds the presidency of the G-20 and emphasised the need for coordinated efforts to address the global challenge arising out of the coronavirus outbreak.\nGoing beyond the perimeter of the region, India also took on board a number of major countries, besides the US to cooperate and coordinate efforts to fight covid-19.\nForeign Secretary Harsh Shringla joined a telephonic conference call initiated by US Deputy Secretary of State Steve Biegun.\nThe teleconference also included senior representatives from Australia, South Korea, Vietnam, New Zealand and Japan.\nIt was decided that these countries would cooperate on vaccine development, challenges of stranded citizens, assistance to countries in need and to mitigate the impact of covid-19 on global economy.\nIndia's soft power diplomacy came into play during this cataclysm affecting the world as the pandemic defies barriers and borders and it projected Prime Minister Modi as a statesman of substance and stature.\n",

It means the situation globally will not solely depend on China or any other single county,\" Cao told online media briefing from Wuhan adding that China would take a call on it in about a month.\nAsked whether China apprehends a second wave of the virus, she said the relapse of the COVID-19 epidemic in China \"would not be a great concern under the current prevention and control measures.\"\nShe said the number of newly reported cases of coronavirus in the country, including imported ones might stay at a relatively low level, but it would last for a certain period of time as the imported cases have become an important source of COVID-19.\nCao also said there is no evidence to show that the virus would abate with the onset of summer and the resultant rise in temperatures, ruling out the prevailing view that summer heat would subdue the virus.\nThere is no data about COVID-19 relevance to the weather pattern.\n\"The impact of the weather on COVID-19 has not been confirmed yet,\" Cao said.\n",

They're going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product,\" he said.\nRight now, he said, China has been sending the US everything it needs. \"But we are looking at some alternatives,\" he added.\nThe US and China have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting conspiracy theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Beijing accusing American officials of stigmatizing an entire nation.\nIn his original tweet on Monday, Trump described US airlines and other industries being \"particularly affected by the Chinese Virus\".\nOn Tuesday, he tweeted that some US states were \"being hit hard by the Chinese Virus\".\nTrump's allies had previously referred to the pandemic as the \"Chinese coronavirus\", but Beijing said it was \"strongly indignant\" over the phrase, which it called \"a kind of stigmatization\".\nThe US should \"immediately stop its unjustified accusations against China,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing.\nA commentary by the official Xinhua news agency said using \"racist and xenophobic names to cast blame for the outbreak on other countries can only reveal politicians' irresponsibility and incompetence which will intensify virus fears.\"\nThe war of words reignited diplomatic tensions between the two countries, which have tussled over trade and other disputes since Trump took office.\nTrump's comments were also criticized inside the US, with warnings it could incite a backlash against the Asian-American community.\n\"Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don't need you fuelling more bigotry,\" tweeted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose state is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the country.\nThe World Health Organization said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China.\nThe new coronavirus was first detected late last year, with China's own health officials initially saying its source was a live animal market in the central city of Wuhan, whose government had initially tried to cover up the outbreak.\nBut China has sought to distance itself from the virus, saying the origin is still unknown, while seeking global goodwill by offering aid to countries facing serious outbreaks.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels \"to shift blame for COVID-19 to the US\", the State Department said.\nPompeo \"stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat\", the department added.\nThe State Department on Friday summoned Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai to denounce Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter last week that \"patient zero\" in the global pandemic may have come from the US.\n\"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,\" tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.\nPompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to the \"Wuhan virus\" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.\nYang issued a \"stern warning to the US that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail\", Xinhua said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.\nThe key Chinese foreign policy leader \"noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people\", Xinhua said.\nYang called on the US side to \"correct its wrongful behaviour\".\nTrump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his backers have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.\nWhile COVID-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "China kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged on Friday, defying expectations for a reduction to ease borrowing costs in an economy jolted by widespread disruptions to businesses from the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was left unchanged at 4.05 per cent from the previous monthly fixing while the five-year remained at 4.75 per cent.\nAnalysts said the unchanged rate suggests policymakers may think recent measures are enough to help the economy in the immediate term, after the central bank last week cut the amount of reserves commercial banks are required to hold.\nForty respondents, or 71.4 per cent of all participants, in a Reuters snap survey had expected a reduction in the LPR, with 36 predicting either a five basis point or 10 basis point cut in the one-year tenor and no change to the five-year rate.\nBut while the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has rolled out powerful easing measures since the coronavirus outbreak, many economists said it was still not enough to revive demand in the current environment.\n\"The lack of any cut this month means that the LPR is still only 10 basis points lower than it was at the end of last year, following a small cut in February,\" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics said in a note.\n\"But with the economy unlikely to get back on track until next year, further monetary easing will be needed to help address the continued strain on corporate and households balance sheets.\"\nThe virus situation has gradually stabilized in mainland China with no new domestic transmissions reported on Thursday for the first time, raising hopes that strict containment efforts to stop the spread of the virus are working.\nBut the situation overseas remains concerning. With over 242,000 infections and nearly 10,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War Two, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu.\nThe LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. The PBOC revamped the mechanism to price LPR in August, loosely pegging it to the medium-term lending facility rate.\nThe PBOC left borrowing cost on its one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans unchanged on Monday, despite its U.S. counterpart’s decision to slash interest rates to near zero to counteract the economic shock from the coronavirus outbreak.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In a matter of days, millions of Americans have seen their lives upended by measures to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\nNormally bustling streets are deserted as families hunker down in their homes. Many of those who do venture out try to stay a safe distance from anyone they encounter, even as they line up to buy now-precious commodities like hand sanitizer. Parents juggle childcare as schools close, perhaps for the rest of the school year. And restaurants and bars sit empty as more and more convert to delivery-only options.\nHow long will this last? Scientists say there isn't a simple answer.\n\"In many ways, this situation is unprecedented - we're trying to take some actions to curb the spread and timing of this pandemic,\" said Stephen Morse, a disease researcher at Columbia University in New York.\nYes, there have been past disease outbreaks that scientists can draw some lessons from but, in those cases, the disease was largely allowed to run its course. \"So those models don't precisely apply,\" Morse said.\nMONTHS-LONG BATTLE\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. may be managing the outbreak through July or August. And New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state's number of coronavirus cases may peak - not end - in 45 days.\nThe overall message is that the country will be fighting the virus outbreak for a matter of months, at least, not days or weeks.\nEach model of how the disease could spread relies on data and assumptions about population dynamics, demographics, health care capacity and other factors, said Rebecca Katz, a public health expert at Georgetown University.\nThe challenge for designing models of what will happen next in the U.S. is that limited testing for COVID-19 means researchers don't know what the starting point is - how many people are already infected.\nIn simplest terms, scientists say that the epidemic will slow when people with infections don't pass the virus on to others.\n\"Basically, if I infect one other person or more ... then the epidemic can take off. If I infect less than one person and everybody infects less than one person, then the epidemic will decline,\" said Elizabeth Halloran, a disease researcher at the University of Washington.\nBased on data from China and from cruise ships, scientists estimate that unless measures are taken to limit the spread, each infected person will infect about 2 or 3 others, leading to an exponential growth of the virus.\nIf the virus makes a jump to new person every two to five days, as scientists calculate, then a single infected person could lead to 4,142 total infections within a month - assuming nothing is done to break chains of transmission.\nUnless such measures are put in place, scientists estimate that between 40 and 80% of the global population could become infected. Based on an analysis of data from China, scientists found that the majority of new infections are transmitted by people with mild symptoms who may not even know they're ill, said Jeffrey Shaman, a public health expert at Columbia University.\nEven if most people recover and only a fraction of total infections are severe enough to require hospitalization - about 14%, scientists estimate - the sheer scale of the epidemic will put enormous strain on hospitals, healthcare workers and other patients who may see unrelated procedures delayed.\nScientists now agree that measures to break or slow the chains of transmission are crucial to ensure that emergency rooms aren't quickly overwhelmed by surges in critically ill patients.\nIf measures like closing schools are successful in slowing disease spread, \"we are going to see a hump instead of a peak\" in new cases, U.S. government disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a White House briefing.\nIn order words, the number of infections will rise more gradually and manageably. But that also means the duration of the outbreak will be prolonged.\n\"The point of the restrictions we have is actually to stretch this out even longer. We don't want a big peak to come very quickly,\" said Mark Jit, a disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"It's not like a Hollywood movie with a clear ending where everyone is saved, or everyone dies, quickly.\"\nHOW DOES THIS END?\nMost scientists believe the fight against COVID-19 won't be over until there's an effective vaccine. But Fauci and other experts say it will be more than a year before a vaccine can be ready for widespread use.\n\"The best-case scenario is that we have vaccine in 12 or 18 months and then our lives go back to normal,\" Jit said. \"The worst-case scenario it takes a long time for a vaccine to be developed, and the world is really changed and our lives aren't the same again.\"\nWhile we wait, are we all shut-ins for more than a year? Almost no one thinks that's realistic.\n\"I don't think we can maintain social distancing as it is right now for the duration of the epidemic,\" said Michael Levy, a University of Pennsylvania disease researcher.\nWhat may be more feasible is a plan for intermittent restrictions and enhanced monitoring to control the disease, an idea explored in a new study from researchers at Imperial College London. Once the number of new cases falls below a certain threshold, schools, offices and restaurants could reopen. But if the number of infections spikes again, restrictions would be reinstated.\n\"The analogy of pumping car brakes on an icy road is what we should be thinking about,\" Levy said. \"You push on the brakes to slow things down, then ease up - but if you skid, you have to pump the brakes again.\"\n",

Some of them -- Covid-19, for example -- were coined only after the virus emerged in China. Our simple glossary aims to unclutter this specialised vocabulary and help you better understand your news feed. Is there a coronavirus-related term that you'd like to see explained but is not on this list? Let us know in the comments section.\nLet's begin.\nCoronavirus \nCovid-19\nMortality (or fatality) rate \nThis is the percentage of infected people who die. We still can't say with certainty what this number is for the new coronavirus disease, but here are a couple of estimates. On March 3, the World Health Organisation reported a global mortality rate of 3.4%, suggesting the disease is deadlier than the seasonal flu (with a death rate less than 1%). Two past epidemics caused by coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, had much higher mortality rates. (Soon after WHO announced the 3.4 figure, US President Donald Trump raised an eyebrow or two with his \"hunch\" that it was a \"false number\".)\nIn February, a study of 44,672 confirmed cases in Mainland China said 2.3 per cent had died. But the rate showed significant variation with age. It was 14.8 per cent for the 80+ category, and just 0.2% for the 10-19, 20-29 and 30-39 groups. It was also higher for men (2.8%) than for women (1.7%).\nPandemic\nPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\nOn January 30, the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern -- an \"extraordinary event\" posing a \"public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and potentially needing \"a coordinated international response\". This doesn't happen often: it was only the sixth such declaration made by WHO. When confronted with a PHEIC, a group of experts advises the UN body's director-general (currently Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia) on measures to be implemented in the disease-hit country and elsewhere.\nSars-CoV-2\nShort for \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\", this is the name of the new coronavirus. It was announced on February 11. Don't confuse it with the virus that caused the outbreak of SARS in the early 2000s. \"While related, the two viruses are different,\" the World Health Organisation explains.\n",

But most people are confused about the difference between a pandemic, an epidemic and an outbreak? The three words are quite different and mixing them would only add to confusion. The main difference between the three is the scale of the spread of the disease.\nSo, to make things easier, we have explained the difference between the words -- pandemic, epidemic and outbreak and how they are used.\nIn this case, the disease spread is on a small scale and unusual. The number of cases is usually small and the area that the disease covers is small as well.\nFor example, a case wherein around 10-20 kids in a class come down with a stomach flu is an outbreak.\nNew diseases give rise to outbreaks as it is immediately noticeable since the symptoms are new.\nAn outbreak usually spurs health agencies into action regarding containing the outbreak.\nIn this case, the disease is on a bigger scale and spreading.\nAn epidemic covers a much larger geographical area than an outbreak.\nWhen the Coronavirus or COVID-19 cases started to come up outside Wuhan in China, it was noted that the Coronavirus outbreak was turning into a Coronavirus epidemic.\nIn this case, the disease is on an international scale and out of control.\nWhen an epidemic spreads to multiple countries, it is considered to be a pandemic. A pandemic is the highest level of global health emergency.\nIn recorded history, WHO has declared only two pandemics -- for influenza in 1918 and for influenza H1N1 in 2009. So, Coronavirus being declared a pandemic is a historic event.\nSometimes, epidemiologists consider a situation to be a pandemic only when the disease affects some new areas and sustains there through local transmission.\nThe term pandemic has a connotation of fear. A pandemic is not easily controllable, often not controllable at all, and health agencies use the term to spread awareness of the seriousness of the disease spread.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Here's what you need to know about the coronavirus epidemic today:\nTESTING TIMES\nThe only question then becomes how public health authorities cope with all the confirmed cases that emerge.\nUS Democrats are nonetheless insisting that Americans must be fully encouraged to go for tests if the economic aid package going through Congress is to get their backing.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted earlier that coronavirus testing in the United States will soon happen on a large scale, but did not provide any details on how that would be accomplished. All eyes are on whether a deal could finally emerge later today.\n.... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!\nKEEP CALM AND CARRY ON\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is facing an onslaught of domestic criticism over its coronavirus strategy, which has so far eschewed the social distancing measures - schools closures, public gathering bans and the like - which are now prevalent across much of continental Europe.\nThe British logic, based on the findings of behavioral research, is that timing is all:\nYet that is not stopping many Brits from going down into lockdown mode themselves - witness evidence of stockpiling and emptier than usual roads and public transport. Pasta, toilet paper, flour and frozen food are all flying off the shelves.\nFEAR, PANIC, HOPE ON THE MARKETS\nFinancial markets now appear to be finding some solace in hopes for more economic stimulus after plumbing the depths of despair earlier this week. The benchmark of European stocks gained a modest 2.6 per cent on Friday after the 12 per cent crash on Thursday that erased over $1 trillion from the value of European firms and plunged global equities into a bear market.\nThe expectation now is that governments will take emergency measures, including boosting liquidity, after the Fed injected $500 billion into the banking system in the States. Australia's central bank followed suit on Friday, pumping $5.52 billion into its daily money market operation.\nTHE SPREAD\nThere are now almost 1,35,000 cases and more than 4,900 deaths form coronavirus recorded in 125 countries and regions, according to a Reuters tally on Friday. Experts say many more cases are either unreported or undetected.\nChina's Wuhan city, ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak, reported five new cases on Friday, the second day in a row the tally has been less than 10, while no locally transmitted infections were reported in the rest of the country.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "People around the world became increasingly closed off from one another Thursday as sweeping travel bans accelerated,walling regions apart as a viral pandemic unfolds and financial markets plunge.\nIt was an outbreak moving, at once, both glacially and explosively, with a virus first detected three months ago in China creeping across borders and producing eruptive outbreaks that have crippled areas.\nEven for a crisis that has brought no shortage of headlines, dizzying developments were flashing across screens: An official designation of \"pandemic\" from the World Health Organisation, a dramatic halt to much travel between the US and 26 European countries, and infections among beloved Hollywood stars, sports luminaries and political leaders.\nAll of it came against a backdrop of plunging world economies that left not only Wall Street investors but people from all walks of life hurting.\n\"We will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now,\" said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nPresident Donald Trump, who had downplayed the virus for days, suddenly struck a different tone, delivering a sombre Oval Office address announcing strict rules on travel from much of Europe to begin this weekend.\nThe State Department followed with an extraordinary warning to Americans to \"reconsider travel abroad\" too. Local leaders warned things would only get worse.\n\"This will be a very difficult time,\" said Dr Jeff Duchin a top public health official for the Seattle area, which has one of the biggest US outbreaks.\n\"It's similar to what you might think of as an infectious disease equivalent of a major earthquake that's going to shake us for weeks and weeks.\"\nAcross the US, where cases now number more than 1,300, a sense of urgency was pervasive.\nNursing homes turned away visitors, schools emptied of students and workplace cubicles went vacant. A rite of spring, college basketball's March Madness, was set to proceed in empty arenas, while professional basketball won't play at all.\nJoyous, booze-filled, green-splashed celebrations of St Patrick's Day were called off. TV shows taped without audiences, rush-hour crowds in New York subway cars disappeared, and families hunkered down wondering what would come next.\n\"If we avoid each other and listen to the scientists, maybe in a few weeks it will be better,\" said Koloud 'Kay' Tarapolsi of Redmond, Washington, who has two children whose schools were being closed beginning Thursday.\nAs the pandemic grips Europe and the US, it continues to ebb in China, where the first cases of COVID-19 emerged in December. It reported a record low of just 15 new cases Thursday and was cautiously monitoring new arrivals who were returning with the virus from elsewhere.\nMore than three-fourths of China's patients have recovered. Most people have only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, though symptoms can be severe, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems.\nRecovery for mild cases takes about two weeks, while more severe illness may take three to six weeks, WHO says.\nMore than 126,000 people in more than 110 countries have been infected. But WHO emphasized the vast majority are in just four countries: China and South Korea - where new cases are declining - and Iran and Italy, where they are not.\n\"We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action,\" said WHO's leader, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear.\"\nHigh-profile announcements of infections made the alarms even louder. Double Oscar winner Tom Hanks said he and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive. Australian officials say the couple are in a Queensland hospital and their close contacts would have to self-quarantine.\nIn Italy, soccer club Juventus said defender Daniele Rugani tested positive. In Iran, the senior vice president and two other Cabinet ministers were reported to have been diagnosed with COVID-19.\nItaly, already under unprecedented restrictions, tightened rules even more. Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte announcing the closure of pubs, restaurants, hair salons, cafeterias and other businesses that can't ensure a meter (yard) of space between workers and customers.\n\"In this moment, all the world is looking at us,\" Conte said, as the rules brought an eerie hush to places around Italy.\nAsian shares plunged Thursday, following a drop of 1,464 points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, putting the index 20 percent below its record set last month and into fearsome territory Wall Street calls a \"bear market\".\n\"There's a real feeling that we don't know where this ends,\" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Policymakers and government leaders have taken a range of approaches to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Here is a list of how some of the world's biggest economies and economic blocs have reacted.\nUNITED STATES\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday instructed the U.S. Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted, saying it would provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.\nTrump also said he was ordering the Small Business Administration to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus by providing low-interest loans to small businesses in affected states and territories, effective immediately. And he suspended all travel from Europe, with a few exceptions, to the United States for 30 days starting on Friday.\nEarlier, Trump signed a $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the spread of the virus and develop vaccines for the highly contagious disease.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by half a percentage point in its first emergency rate move since the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Investors expect more cuts in the weeks ahead.\nCHINA\nChina said it had earmarked 110.5 billion yuan ($15.9 billion) to fight the epidemic.\nBeijing has ramped up funding support for virus-hit regions and the country's central bank has cut several of its key rates, including the benchmark lending rate, and has urged banks to give cheap loans and payment relief to exposed companies.\nChina will modify the environmental supervision of companies to help the resumption of production disrupted by the coronavirus epidemic, giving firms more time to rectify environmental problems.\nJAPAN\nJapan unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, focusing on support to small and mid-sized firms, as concerns mount about risks to the fragile economy.\nSeparately, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has pledged to pump more liquidity into markets and step up asset buying.\nJapan's central bank may also take steps to ensure companies hit by the coronavirus outbreak do not face a financial squeeze before the end of the current fiscal year in March, according to sources familiar with the central bank's thinking.\nEUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nThe ECB, the central bank of the euro zone, has so far avoided cutting interest rates. Policymakers did hold an unscheduled meeting on March 3 but it was to discuss operational responses to coronavirus, such as whether to hold events and staff shortages, rather than any policy response, sources close to the matter said.\nThe ECB has asked euro zone banks to review their business continuity plans and the actions they can take to prepare for and minimize the potential adverse effects of the coronavirus, a letter seen by Reuters shows.\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION\nEuropean Union leaders have so far failed to agree radical measures to tackle the crisis. The head of the bloc's executive Ursula von der Leyen said the European Commission will set up a joint investment fund with firepower of 25 billion euros ($28 billion) from existing resources to cushion the blow to vulnerable sectors of the bloc's economies.\nGERMANY\nGermany's centre-left coalition agreed to increase public investments by 12.4 billion euros by 2024 and to make it easier for companies to claim subsidies to support workers on reduced working hours to counter the effects of the coronavirus epidemic.\nChancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are split over whether Germany should rush out a fiscal stimulus package to counter any impact of the coronavirus on Europe's largest economy.\nBudget experts estimate the government has the fiscal room for additional measures worth at least 17 billion euros ($18.9 billion). Some officials say that Berlin could even put together a stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros, without ditching the government's policy of no new debt.\nBRITAIN\nBritain launched a 30 billion-pound ($39 billion) economic stimulus plan just hours after the Bank of England slashed interest rates, a double-barrelled package aimed at warding off the risk of a coronavirus recession.\nThe Bank of England cut interest rates by half a percentage point and offered banks cheaper funding and a reduction in capital buffers in an emergency move to bolster Britain's economy against disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFRANCE\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Marie has said that Europe needs to be ready to use fiscal stimulus to deal with the impact of the coronavirus.\nThe government is allowing companies to suspend payments of some social charges and taxes, and is activating state-subsidised short-time work schemes. It has ordered the Bpifrance state investment bank to guarantee loans needed to overcome short-term cashflow problems.\nParis has also allowed companies to declare force majeure due to the outbreak if they cannot honor a contract with the public sector, and is putting pressure on big companies to show similar leniency with subcontractors.\nINDIA\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to infuse fresh cash liquidity into the system through a second round of long-term repo operations (LTRO), government officials told Reuters, amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak will derail any revival of economic growth. One official said the RBI might inject as much as 1 trillion rupees ($13.6 billion) in the round that will begin as early as April.\nThe RBI has said it stands ready to act to maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability.\nThe government is, meanwhile, pushing state-run banks to approve new loans amounting to 500-600 billion rupees by the end of March, according to government sources.\nITALY\nItaly has doubled the amount it plans to spend on tackling its coronavirus outbreak to 7.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion) and is raising this year's deficit goal to 2.5% of national output from the current 2.2% target.\nPayments on mortgages will be suspended across the whole of Italy and Italy's banking lobby ABI said lenders would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout from the virus.\nCANADA\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau said on March 9 that the government was \"looking at taking some initiatives this week,\" as Canada reported its first coronavirus death, with a steep decline in oil prices expected to hit the world's fourth-largest crude producer hard.\nThe Bank of Canada lowered its benchmark overnight rate to 1.25% from 1.75% in response to the epidemic, prompting money markets to price in a better-than-even chance of another reduction next month. The last time it cut by 50 basis points was in 2009 during the financial crisis.\nSOUTH KOREA\nThe government announced a stimulus package of 11.7 trillion won ($9.8 billion) to cushion the impact of the largest outbreak of coronavirus outside China.\nFinance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the supplementary budget, subject to parliamentary approval, would channel money to the health system, childcare, and outdoor markets. An additional 10.3 trillion won in treasury bonds will be issued this year to fund the extra budget.\nSeoul has also dramatically tightened rules on short-selling for three months.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "政策制定者和政府领导人采取了一系列措施来应对冠状病毒对经济的影响。以下是一些世界上最大的经济体和经济集团的反应。\n美国\n美国总统特朗普周三指示美国财政部推迟纳税，对某些受到负面影响的个人和企业不计息也不处罚，称这将为美国经济提供逾2000亿美元的额外流动性。\n特朗普还说，他下令小企业管理局向受冠状病毒影响的公司提供资本和流动性，向受影响州和地区的小企业提供低息贷款，立即生效。从周五开始，他暂停了所有从欧洲到美国的旅行，只有少数例外，为期30天。\n早些时候，特朗普签署了一项83亿美元的紧急开支法案，以遏制病毒的传播，并为这种高传染性疾病研发疫苗。\n美国联邦储备委员会（Federal Reserve）自2008年金融危机最严重以来首次紧急降息0.5个百分点。投资者预计未来几周将有更多降息。\n中国\n中国表示，已专项拨款1105亿元人民币（合159亿美元）抗击疫情。\n中国政府加大了对病毒感染地区的资金支持力度，中国央行下调了包括基准贷款利率在内的几项关键利率，并敦促银行向暴露在外的企业提供廉价贷款和支付救济。\n中国将修改对企业的环境监管，以帮助恢复因冠状病毒疫情而中断的生产，使企业有更多时间纠正环境问.\n日本\n日本公布了第二套措施，价值约40亿美元，用于应对冠状病毒爆发的影响，重点是支持中小企业，因为人们越来越担心脆弱的经济面临风险。\n另外，日本央行行长黑田东彦（Haruhiko Kuroda）承诺，将向市场注入更多流动性，并加大资产购买力度。\n据熟悉日本央行思路的消息人士透露，日本央行也可能采取措施，确保受冠状病毒疫情打击的企业在3月本财年结束前不会面临资金紧缩。\n欧洲中央银行\n欧洲央行（ECB）是欧元区央行，迄今为止一直避免降息。知情人士说，决策者的确在3月3日举行了一次非计划会议，但会议的目的是讨论应对冠状病毒的行动对策，例如是否举行活动和人员短缺，而不是讨论任何政策对策。\n路透社看到的一封信显示，欧洲央行已要求欧元区银行重新审视其业务连续性计划，以及它们可以采取的行动，为冠状病毒的潜在不利影响做好准备，并将其降至最低。\n欧洲联盟\n欧盟领导人迄今未能就解决危机的激进措施达成一致。欧盟执行长冯德莱恩（Ursula von der Leyen）表示，欧盟委员会（European Commission）将设立一个联合投资基金，从现有资源中获得250亿欧元（280亿美元）的火力，以缓冲对欧盟经济脆弱部门的打击。\n德国\n德国中左翼联盟同意到2024年将公共投资增加124亿欧元，并使企业更容易申请补贴，支持工人减少工作时间，以应对冠状病毒疫情的影响。\n德国总理默克尔（Angela Merkel）的保守派对德国是否应该匆忙推出一项财政刺激计划以应对冠状病毒对欧洲最大经济体的任何影响意见不.\n预算专家估计，政府有足够的财政空间，可以采取至少170亿欧元（约合189亿美元）的额外措施。一些官员说，柏林甚至可以制定一个价值高达500亿欧元的刺激计划，而不放弃政府的无新债务政策。\n英国\n就在英国央行（Bank of England）降息数小时后，英国推出了一项300亿英镑（合390亿美元）的经济刺激计划，这是一项旨在规避冠状病毒衰退风险的双管齐下的一揽子计划。\n英国央行（Bank of England）将利率下调了0.5个百分点，并为银行提供了更便宜的资金和减少资本缓冲，以应对冠状病毒爆发造成的经济混乱。\n法国\n法国财政部长勒玛丽（Bruno Le-Marie）表示，欧洲需要做好准备，利用财政刺激来应对冠状病毒的影响。\n政府允许企业暂停支付部分社会费用和税收，并启动国家补贴的短期工作计划。它已下令法国国家投资银行（Bpifrance state investment bank）为克服短期现金流问题所需的贷款提供担保。\n巴黎还允许企业在无法履行与公共部门的合同的情况下，因疫情而宣布不可抗力，并向大公司施压，要求它们对转包商表现出类似的宽大处理。\n印度\n印度储备银行（RBI）计划通过第二轮长期回购操作（LTRO）向该系统注入新的现金流动性，政府官员告诉路透社，他们担心冠状病毒的爆发将破坏经济增长的任何复苏。一位官员表示，印度央行可能在最早4月开始的本轮注资中注入多达1万亿卢比（约合136亿美元）。\n印度央行表示，随时准备采取行动，维护市场信心和金融稳.\n与此同时，据政府消息人士透露，政府正在推动国有银行在3月底前批准5000-6000亿卢比的新贷款。\n意大利\n意大利计划用于应对冠状病毒爆发的资金增加了一倍，达到75亿欧元（84亿美元），并将今年的赤字目标从目前的2.2%提高到占全国产出的2.5%。\n整个意大利都将暂停支付抵押贷款，意大利银行业游说团体ABI表示，贷款机构将向正在应对病毒带来的经济影响的小公司和家庭提供债务暂停。\n加拿大\n加拿大财政部长比尔·莫内乌3月9日表示，加拿大政府“正在考虑本周采取一些举措”，因为加拿大报告了首次冠状病毒死亡事件，预计油价大幅下跌将严重打击这家全球第四大原油生产国。\n加拿大央行（Bank of Canada）为应对这一流行病，将隔夜基准利率从1.75%下调至1.25%，这促使货币市场在下个月再次下调利率的可能性甚至大于预期。上次下调50个基点是在2009年金融危机期间。\n韩国\n政府宣布了11.7万亿韩元（约合98亿美元）的刺激计划，以缓冲中国境外最大规模的冠状病毒爆发的影响。\n财政部长洪南基说，补充预算经议会批准后，将把资金用于医疗系统、儿童保育和户外市场。今年还将发行10.3万亿韩元的国债，为额外预算提供资金。\n首尔还大幅收紧了3个月的卖空规定。从3月11日开始，卖空交易突然异常增加的股票将暂停10天的进一步卖空",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The coronavirus outbreak disrupted Islamic worship in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia on Wednesday banned its citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca, while Iran canceled Friday prayers in major cities.\nThe decisions in Riyadh and Tehran affected both Sunni and Shiite Muslims alike.\nThe Saudi move expands a ban last week on foreigners visiting Mecca and Medina, home to the holiest sites in Islam. That decision alone disrupted travel for thousands of Muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affects plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage.\nEven after that announcement on Feb. 27, people already in Saudi Arabia could still travel to Mecca's Grand Mosque, where pilgrims circle the black, cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims around the world pray toward five times a day. The crowds were far smaller crowds than usual before Wednesday's statement from an unidentified Interior Ministry official that was carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.\nMillions attend the annual hajj, which this year is set for late July into early August, and many more visit the kingdom’s holy sites year round. Those other pilgrimages are referred to as the umrah, which drew 7.5 million foreigners in 2019 alone.\nIt remains unclear how the ban will be enforced. The government described the suspension as temporary, but gave no hint at when it will be lifted. The ban also appeared to encompass the Prophet Muhammad's Mosque in nearby Medina.\nThe decision seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic and prevent its access to the Two Holy Mosques, which are witnessing a permanent and intense flow of human crowds, which makes the issue of securing these crowds of utmost importance,\" the Saudi government said.\nIn Iran, authorities halted Friday prayers in all provincial capitals amid the country's growing coronavirus outbreak, which has killed at least 92 people amid 2,922 confirmed cases. Iran and Italy have the world's highest death tolls outside of China.\nThis disease is a widespread one, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told his Cabinet, according to a transcript. It encompasses almost all of our provinces and is, in a sense, a global disease that many countries in the world have become infected with, and we must work together to tackle this problem as quickly as possible.\nThe announcement came a week after a similar order affected Tehran and several other major cities.\nWhile observant Muslims can pray at home, the devout prefer to attend Friday prayers as a community. Iran's Shiite theocracy also use the services to share ideological messages by clergymen selected by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nThere are now over 3,150 cases of the virus across the Mideast. Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic.\nTop leaders in Iran's civilian government and Shiite theocracy have become infected with the virus. The country stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 90,000 people and caused over 3,100 deaths.\nExperts continue to worry that Iran may be underreporting its cases.\nThe spread of the virus to almost all of Iran’s provinces leave little doubt that the authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak, wrote Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at the risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. After a slow and politicized response to the outbreak, the government now faces a race against time to prevent a public health emergency from turning into an economic crisis.\"\nAuthorities in Iran said they arrested a man for posting a video online of bodies wrapped in white shrouds and zipped into black body bags at a cemetery in Qom on Monday.\nThe video purports to show over 30 corpses waiting to be washed per Islamic tradition, with a man's voice alleging all were corona-infected.\nAli Ramezani, the executive manager of the Qom cemetery, later told state television that authorities were awaiting the outcome of coronavirus tests on them before they were prepared for burial. Bodies testing positive are buried by staff wearing gloves and protective gear, and the graves are lined with lime.\nIf the test results are negative, then there is no need to bury them based on the protocol for the new coronavirus and the family can receive the body of their loved ones and bury it where they want, Ramezani said.\nEshaq Jahangiri, Iran's senior vice president, meanwhile banned all overseas trips for officials to attend international events, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported. That did not affect Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh, who traveled with an entourage to Vienna for an OPEC meeting.\nRouhani, in his Cabinet meeting, acknowledged the toll the outbreak was taking on the public. He called on state television to offer happier programs to entertain those stuck at home.\nI urge all artists, scientists, psychologists and all who can bring smiles to people’s faces, come into the social media, he said.

        "news_content_translate_en": "According to Reuters, Wuhan has been closed for more than two months since April 8, which will promote the resumption of work and production in different regions and levels.\nAccording to the report, it has been two months since Wuhan began to \"close the city\" at 10:00 on January 23. However, the central government pointed out that \"there is still a risk of sporadic cases and local outbreaks\", and that a new confirmed case in Wuhan yesterday was a doctor who did not rule out nosocomial infection, which, combined with the spread of overseas epidemics and the increasing risk of import, means that China cannot be taken lightly in preventing the recurrence of local epidemics or import from abroad.\nThe novel coronavirus pneumonia control command of Hubei Province issued a circular on Tuesday. From 0:00 in April 8th, Wuhan lifted the control measures from Han to Yue channel, and orderly resumed external traffic. The Han people were transported safely and orderly by the \"green code\" of Hubei health code.\nAccording to the assessment of epidemic risk level and on the premise of epidemic prevention and control, Wuhan city will promote the enterprises to return to work and production in different areas and in different periods and conditions. Outside of Wuhan, the control of the exit passageway will be lifted from 0:00 on March 25, and the external traffic will be restored in an orderly manner. The personnel who leave Hubei will flow in an orderly and safe manner with the Hubei health code \"green code\". As for the personnel from other provinces who come to Hubei Province and come to Han Dynasty, with the health code of other provinces or the \"green code\" of Hubei health code, they can flow safely and orderly in the whole province, and do not need to provide additional health certificate (except for those who are unable to apply for the health code), flow certificate, application approval form or acceptance certificate of the place of inflow, vehicle pass, etc.\nReported yesterday that novel coronavirus pneumonia leader Li Keqiang, head of the State Council and the Central Committee of the State Council, chaired a leading group meeting, saying that the current spread of the national epidemic situation in Wuhan, which is the main battleground, has basically been blocked. Sporadic sporadic cases and the risk of partial outbreaks are still there. The epidemic is widespread in the world. The situation is still complex and severe. Clear head, never take lightly. We should implement the overall prevention and control strategy of \"external defense input and internal defense rebound\", and maintain the hard won prevention and control achievements.\nWuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission said earlier that on March 23, one newly confirmed case was found in the city. The patient was a doctor of the provincial people's Hospital (Headquarters), who was working in the hospital recently, and the hospital infection was not excluded. At 0-24 o'clock on March 23, 345 visits were made to fever clinics in the city, 11 fewer than the day before, including 210 first visits. On March 23, 10441 nucleic acids were detected in the cit。\nYesterday, financial news, China's domestic financial media, said that after confirming to people in the disease control department, \"the notice on the suspension of the national and provincial aid teams for Disease Control in Hubei Province\" was true. The report quoted a person close to China's CDC as saying that the suspension of the withdrawal of the teams from the CDC was a national level \"temporarily uneasy about the situation in Wuhan and Hubei\", allowing the anti epidemic team to stay for several days and keep alert.\nReuters said the situation of asymptomatic people infected with the new coronavirus was of greater concern. If the zero growth of confirmed cases can be maintained and stabilized, the disease control team can withdraw in the next step. \"There are still a few or a dozen asymptomatic positive cases detected every day, and it's not clear whether the transmission in Wuhan has been completely blocked,\" the report quoted disease control experts as saying.\nIn March 20th, the novel coronavirus Pneumonia Control Department of Hubei Province issued the above notice, and coordinated the work of the new crown pneumonia epidemic prevention and control command to coordinate the state and the provincial AIDS control teams to depart from Hubei, and to undertake the related business according to the original plan.\nHowever, Wu Hao, leader of the community prevention and control expert group of the prevention and control group of the front working group of the national health and Health Commission, was quoted by CCTV news microblog as saying that it should not be misunderstood as the rebound or aggravation of the epidemic situation that the emergency rescue team of Hubei Province should be suspended. The disease control team came with the medical teams from all provinces. The two tasks for the disease control team to stay in Hubei are: first, to do a good job in preparation, emergency plan handling and killing before returning to work, second, to carry out a large training for the relevant medical and administrative personnel in Hubei Province, so as to leave a disease control team that can fight well.\nTu Yuanchao, deputy director of Hubei health and Health Commission, was quoted by CCTV yesterday as saying that according to the national health and Health Commission's monitoring of \"Fuyang\" patients and the preliminary study of experts, no \"Fuyang\" patients have been found to infect people, but a designated hospital has been deployed to carry out clinical observation on \"Fuyang\" patients, and disease control departments are required to carry out epidemiological follow-up investigation on patients , relevant scientific research institutions carry out virus culture or virus load monitoring on patients' samples to further clarify the infectious problem of \"Fuyang\" patients",

Quarantined cities, cancelled transports, suspended flights, downtown purses, food shortages in supermarkets, thousands of citizens in isolation on ships, hotels or in their homes. After China, the new coronavirus appears to be testing health devices and a consequent response from European (but not only) countries to an epidemic.\nIn just over three days, Italy has seen an exponential increase in positive cases: if only three people infected with the virus were accounted for by Friday, and all of them identified as new arrivals from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began at the end of last year, This Tuesday, three more people died, raising the balance sheet to 11.\nThe cases of the past few days are causing a race to the masks. This Tuesday, the Italian judicial authorities launched an investigation into the rapid escalation of prices for the online sale of products such as clinical masks and disinfectant gel bottles, with deputy attorney general from Milan, Sicilian Tiziana, The online price of masks rose from one cent to ten euros each and a bottle of disinfectant gel that cost seven euros a week ago rose to 39 euros,\"she said, quoted by Reuters.\nItaly already sums up the equivalent of about one third of the deaths outside China, with more than 300 confirmed cases, but continues to seek its \"patient zero\" and tightens the restraint measures.

Older people with associated diseases, such a s cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, are being most affected.\nThe Croatian Prime Minister, Andrej Plenkovivic, confirmed the first case of infection in the Balkan country. \"The patient is in an infectious disease clinic in Zagreb. He's a younger person, and he has mild symptoms. He is in isolation and his condition is positive at the moment,\"explained the ruler cited by The Guardian.\nA few minutes earlier Austria was confirming the first two cases detected. A spokesman for the health authority of the province of Tyrol, bordering the northern region of Italy, confirmed that two Italians tested positive for control of the coronavirus.

Meanwhile, the South Korean authorities are preparing to undergo medical examinations more than 220 thousand people belonging to a religious cultYeah. The Government considers that this organization, the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji, has played a key role in the spread of the new coronavirus (Covid-19) in the country. The leader of this group has agreed to cede to the authorities the identification of the members so that they can be subject to clinical control.\nOn Sunday, South Korea reported the highest alert level, due to the number of cases of infection with the new coronavirus, which reached 602 with six deaths.

        "news_content_translate_en": "\"In meeting\" means \"analyzing data\", waiting for explicit instructions from competent authorities. This is the summary of a dozen contacts made by the public to agencies and operators organising and marketing senior trips. None are officially ready to proceed with refunds and, although, as SporYoung's manager said, if there are \"enough\" calls from concerned parents, there are no cancellations.\nAlso because the note from the Directorate-General for School Settlements (Dgeste), published this Wednesday, only \"advises\" to consider visits by students abroad (in general) and Prime Minister Costa said that \"it might be advisable to avoid\" making such trips. In the absence of a specific directive, the companies in the sector, which were contacted this Thursday, were merely alert and waiting for further developments to comment more substantially on the subject.\n\"We are monitoring the development of the situation with great care and concern since its beginning in December, and monitoring the recommendations made by the competent bodies,\" said Catherine Reis of the Megafinalists (Geostar), who has two major finalist programs around Easter-Andorra and Sal o, in Catalonia, a region where a case of Covid-19 (Barcelona) has already been confirmed. The person responsible says that, \"at the moment, there is no change to the travel programme.\" The trip to Andorra has the details of sponsoring the Sumol brand. According to information from the Communication Adviser, Julio Gomes, Sumol+Compal was still analysing the data and communications of the relevant authorities on Thursday afternoon to decide whether to withdraw support, which would lead to the cancellation of the Sumol Snowtrip trip, a programme which is being carried out 15 years agoYeah.\nSporYounger, who is responsible for bringing about six thousand students to Marina d'Or (Valencian Community, already with eight recorded cases), assumes that she has received \"enough\" phone calls from \"concerned parents\" asking for more information and clarification. During those days, all the accommodation units of the Valencian tourist complex are booked by the company, so \"the destination will only have Portuguese tourists\", says the responsible one. So far, says the coordinator, Rita Veiga, have not received any request for cancellation of the reservation. The responsible officer indicates that she is in \"daily contact with the Portuguese and local authorities [Spanish] and the Portuguese Tourism\" and that, to date, they have not received any indication from any of these authorities to cancel the programme.\nRita Veiga further argues that if the event were cancelled by the authorities, it would be necessary \"to see Portugal's Tourism and the companies that have signed the health insurance of each student on whom responsibility falls\" of the reimbursements.\nAs for cases of cancellation before such indication, SporYoung coordinator refers to the general conditions published on the company website. They state that \"cancellations made less than thirty days, including the date of commencement of the journey, have 100% expenses and no value is reimbursed. With more than thirty days the customer will have to pay a minimum value of 70 per person.\"\nOne month from March to April, the event is already \"all booked and paid for\". However, Rita Veiga says \"no figures\" about possible damage from accommodation to transport, as well as the performers who are part of the programme\". A change in the fate of the event is not on the table, but the agency may \"consider changing the dates\"Yeah.\nAlso in the process of weighing are large companies selling senior trips, in the case of the Abreu Agency which, after the initial publication of this article, sent the PUBLIC a written comment: \"We have several customers calling or visiting our shops and asking questions about whether they can or should cancel,\" refers to the commercial director of the agency, Pedro Quintela.\nStressing that it clarifies and proceeds with cancellations and reimbursements \"for destinations considered by the World Health Organisation and referred to in the Community Portal as risk destinations\" (since 24/01, China, Hong and Macao; since the last weekend in Northern Italy), the responsible, As far as the senior programmes are concerned, it is already sending them to another general field, namely the package of trips to destinations which have not yet been officially considered to be at risk. \"We will examine on a case-by-case basis, managing the risk-based situations defined by the WHO. Other destinations other than those defined (by the WHO) will always have to be analysed and discussed,\"he stressed. The general practice in this case: if \"a customer wants to cancel a tourist package (...) it will only be repaid the value between the cost of the trip and the cost that the Travel Agency has already or will have with that program,\"also depending on the additional insurance cover that the customer may have purchased\".\nIn the field of the most specialized, such as the Travel Wing, which promotes eight alternate destinations for the finalists, there was still no clear position, with the company studying the subject and expecting official restrictions. Contacts with other companies such as Slide In, Student Travellers or Travel Fun could not be commented on until the time of publication of this articlYeah.\nLikewise for the Portuguese Association of Travel and Tourism Agencies (APAVT), whose president, Pedro Costa Ferreira, admitted, even on Wednesday in a public/Renaissance interview, that it was \"reasonable\" to say that \"the sector will have a problem at Easter\". \"The big reserves are now starting in March, Easter is in April and there is no expectation of a spike in reserves with this whole environment, which has not yet reached its peak,\" he said, noting that \"the Easter effect will have a negative effect on the sector. Because, of course, if there are no reserves and there are no travel there will be less revenue, less billing.\"\nAs the aim is to ensure the \"safety of Portuguese students\", the National Youth Council (CNJ), in which several student associations also sit, indicated that it \"subscribes\" to the warning made by Dgeste.\nAs regards the dilemma open with travel agencies regarding a possible reimbursement of payments already made by households, Rita Saias considers that \"it is not for the CNJ to decide on specific cases in this context\", but leaves another warning: \"This is just one more showing the need to review the model of the overall senior trip.\"\nFor their part, the two national confederations of parents'associations have already called for \"common sense\" from the agencies contracted for the senior excursions. The destination of many senior trips is usually South Spain, where several cases of infection are already confirmed. \"This is not only about the safety of pupils, but also about the national interest in controlling the spread of the disease,\" said the President of the National Confederation of Parents'Associations (Confap), George AscentioYeah.\n\"If I had already paid, I would rather be without the money than risk my daughter contracting the infection,\" said the president of the Independent Confederation of Parents and Education Trustees (CNIPE), Rui Martins, which hopes, however, that a position of \"common sense on all sides will prevail in order to minimise the damage to all\".\nOn the other hand, the Portuguese Association for Consumer Protection, Deco refers to a text with general advice on coronavirus and travel, even without specifying anything specific about senior trips. As some agency officials have commented, the online document on package travel highlights the right to reimbursement at China and Northern Italy destinations. \"The law allows the traveler to terminate the contract at any time before starting the journey. And it will not have to pay the travel agency any cancellation fee, because there are exceptional circumstances at or near the place of destination that significantly affect the carrying out of the planned journey.\"\nBut: \"This is the only way it will be in relation to the destinations severely affected by the virus. In relation to travel insurance, in \"none of the policies analysed if it considers force majeure to cancel the trip for fear of contagion\", says Deco. \"Therefore, we cannot generally say that travel insurance can be activated due to the coronavirus. It depends on the policy and the situation to be ensured, such as the payment of medical expenses for those who have been infected during a journey, or the reimbursement of expenses for cancelling a trip, for example. Without directives expressed to other destinations, it is \"impossible to give a single answer to these questions\".\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the most profound works of the publiYeah.\n52 suspicious cases have so far been reported in Portugal, 36 of which have been negative after laboratory tests, and results are expected from the remaining 16s.

In this predictive framework, the growth will be of 3,3% at 2021 (just above the expected 3,1% in November) said the OECD Chief Economist, estimating the organisation that, in this view, all impacts start to fade gradually at the beginning of next year.\nA scenario that cuts world economic growth in 0.5% implies a drop in 4% of domestic demand in China and Hong Kong in the first quarter of this year, to which more 2% in the second quarter join. Overall, a drop in 10% in markets and non-food raw materials in the first half of 2020 explains the OECD.\nAt this reading, the growth of the euro area will be 0,8% while remaining 1,2% at 2021, downloading from the previous OECD forecast, 1,1%. OECD forecasts are getting worse for France (growing 0,9% in 2020, in the face of 1,3% in 2019 and in the light of the 1,2% expected in November for this year) and Italy (stagnation at 0% in the face of 0,2% growth in 2019 and a cut in relation to the 0,4% that the OECD had foreseen four months ago). For Germany, the forecast is 0,3% in 2020, in relation to 0,6% in 2019. In November 2019, the OECD estimated that the German economy would grow 0.4% this yeaYeah.\nIn China, the expected growth for 2020 is 4,9%, when in 2019 it was 6,1%. Here, the forecast cut between November and today is 0,8 percentage points.\nIn the worst-case scenario of domin o effect, where \"this is not the worst-case scenario\" Laurence Boone said this morning that he circumvented all direct questions about the possibility of a potential short-term recession, global or country-wide, the impact on world GDP will be 1.5%. In other words, the OECD's chief economist recalled \"almost half of the expected [global] economic growth [by the OECD] four months ago\". At that time, as already mentioned, the forecast was that in 2020 the overall growth would be 2,9%.\nIn this scenario, in addition to the forecast reduction of Chinese domestic demand in the same order as the \"most optimistic\" scenario, an extension is added to other regions: a decrease in \"more than 2% in demand in most Asia-Pacific countries\" and in the more developed economies in the Northern Hemisphere during the second quarter of this year, with a decrease in 20% in the capital market and in the price of non-food raw materials, plus \"an increase in demand for 50-point basis for the risk premium for investment in all countries'.\nThe OECD is particularly concerned about the'trust shock'in world markets, reflected last week in the main, if not all, squares of Asia, Europe and the USA.\nAnd this, Laurence Boone argued this Monday, \"is not a shock that can be faced only by the central banks.\" The chief economist of the organisation said that we must deal with and increase confidence in the capital market. \"This is not a crisis that can be fought by the central banks, but by the budgetary authorities.\"\nGovernments \"must act now to restrict the advancement of the new coronavirus, to protect populations and businesses from its effects and to support economic demand\", says the organizatioYeah.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\n\"There is much that governments can do for people,\" Laurence Boone said, while presenting power point to journalists by video conference. And after the page entitled \"Governments must act now\", he listed the possible measures. For the general population:'increase resources for the health sector','temporarily finance for more vulnerable families','expand temporary work models'.\nIn the case of companies, OECD suggestions for global governments to deal with the new coronavirus involve \"reducing or postponing tax recoveries for the most affected sectors\"; \"increasing liquidity and availability of credit to businesses\", and \"reducing state debt to the business sector\".\nIn macroeconomic terms, the OECD also leaves a mini-script:'increase liquidity to banking', ensure that monetary policy has an adequate response'to extreme market conditions','allow automatic stabilisers to function fully'and'increase public investment'",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that it takes 675 million dollars (about 613 million euros) to implement a global plan to combat viruses in the next three months, this Wednesday was announced at a press conference. The WHO also revealed that experts will meet in Geneva (Switzerland) to 11 and 12 in February to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and vaccines. So far, there are almost 25 thousand infected people and almost 500 deaths from this virus.\nFor now, the WHO has called for a fund of 675 million dollars to combat the virus in the world and in China between February and April. Of these, 60 million dollars (about 54 million euros) will be for WHO operations and the rest for those countries that are especially at risk. This is the budget for the Strategic Plan of Preparation and Response, which includes activities and resources for international organizations to combat the new coronavirus. The aim is to limit the transmission between people, especially in the most vulnerable countries, as well as to identify, isolate and care for patients early, or to minimise the economic and social impact.\n\"My greatest concern is in countries that today have no systems to operate to detect people infected by the virus,\" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Urgent support is needed to reinforce health systems that detect, diagnose and protect more transmission between humans and healthcare professionals.\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the WHO, also said that \"very soon\" a WHO team will go to China.\n\"The effectiveness of the response to the outbreak depends on preparatory measures,\" said Mike Ryan, director of the WHO emergency programme. \"This is why we are seeking resources to safeguard the most vulnerable countries.\"\nOne of the big issues is also the advance in treatments for the new coronavirusYeah. So far, there's no specific drug or vaccine against the virus. Due to some speculation on the development of new treatments, the WHO has made a point of reinforcing this week that \"there are still no effective therapies against this 2019-nCoV\" and that several experts are meeting this month to set the priorities for these advances.\nAlthough there has been no specific treatment, the Chinese Government has suggested antiviral drugs used to treat HIV, such as lopinavir and ritonavir, and the inhalation of a dose of clouded interferon-alpha twice a day. Gilead Sciences is also testing an antiviral therapy for Ebola virus with patients infected with the new coronavirus.\nAs for the vaccine, scientists in Australia have developed a version of the laboratory-grown virus, which may be an important step in the development of a vaccine. Also, the Alliance for Epidemic Ready Innovations (CEPI) has already announced that three different research teams are developing vaccines and that the objective is to start clinical trials in June.\nThe Russian health minister, Mikhail Murashko, also said this Wednesday that scientists in Russia hope it will take at least eight to ten months to develop a vaccine for the virus. \"Today the process of developing a vaccine is not done in a short period of time. A vaccine is being developed in at least eight to ten months,\"he said, quoted by the Russian Interfax News Agency. Last week, Russia announced that it was working on a vaccine with China.\nThe choice of a new name for this virus, temporarily designated 2019-nCoV by the WHO, may appear somewhat smaller. \"The name [official] of the new virus is very late because the focus so far has been on public health response,\" said Crystal Watson, professor at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Safety (USA), cited on the BBC websitYeah. However, there are some reasons why the name choice becomes more of a priority. \"When we do not have an official name, there is a danger that people will start using terms like'Chinese virus'and that they may create a negative reaction against certain populations.\"\nThe International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) is responsible for choosing the name. According to the Committee's guidelines, the name shall not include geographical locations, names of persons, the name of an animal or type of food, or references to a culture or industry. This name should be short and descriptive, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). A group from ICTV is already deliberating on the new name.\nOfficial names can also become a problem. Moreover, in 2015, WHO criticised the name MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) as it could provoke, for example, a negative reaction against members of religious and ethnic communities.\nThere is still a lot to uncover about the virus, but one of the data that is thought to be already acquired is what transmission can occur in the period before the onset of symptoms. Initially, one of the strongest evidence for this hypothesis came from a Chinese woman who had had a meeting in Munich: she would have infected other people and would have had symptoms only days later. This situation was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. However, the researchers had only relied on the accounts of German patients. The Robert Koch Institute, the German public health agency, and the Bavarian Food Safety and Health Authority spoke to the Chinese patient and were now informed that she still had symptoms during her stay in Germany. Despite this new information, other data substantiate the hypothesis that asymptomatic transmission takes place.\nThis Wednesday also announced the case of the youngest person infected with the new coronaviruYeah. The Chinese media reported that a baby was diagnosed with the virus only thirty hours after birth, referred to in the English newspaper The Guardian. According to Chinese state television CCTV, the virus had been detected in the baby's mother before delivery. This Wednesday also confirmed four more cases in Singapore, including a six-month-old baby.\nAlso on the transmission of the virus, it was confirmed in the last week that a doctor who issued an alert on the coronavirus is also infected. The story of this ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang, began in mid-December when he wrote a message in his group of college friends. In this message, you said that in your hospital there were seven patients with SARS-like symptoms. He would also ask that his friends and their families be careful.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs the message eventually went viral, the police accused him of spreading rumors, which could lead to his arrest for seven years. According to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, seven other doctors received the same warning. The doctor eventually had to sign a statement in which he assumed his failure and promised not to do the same again. A few days later, he became infected with the new coronavirus after treating a patient.\nThe new coronavirus has not yet arrived in Africa, but the African Disease Control and Prevention Centres have already activated their emergency operations center to tackle the virus and are organising a workshop in Senegal for 15 African countries.\nAn isolation wing is ready in the hospital in Khartoum, Sudan. Laboratories in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Madagascar or Sierra Leone already have the equipment to detect the viruYeah. Passengers arriving at Cameroon or Gambia airports are being monitored for fever and other viral symptoms.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW DELHI/MUMBAI - India ordered a 21-day lockdown of its 1.3 billion people on Tuesday to try to protect the world's second most populous country from the coronavirus spreading around the world.  \n Health researchers have warned that more than a million people in India could be infected with the coronavirus by mid-May, prompting the government to shut down all air and train travel, businesses and schools.  \n On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the powerful leader of the world's biggest democracy went further, saying nobody in the world's biggest democracy will be allowed to leave their homes for the next three weeks from midnight on Tuesday.  \n \"The only way to save ourselves from coronavirus is if we don’t leave our homes, whatever happens, we stay at home,\" Modi said in a second address in less than a week to try and rally around Indians behind the sweeping lockdown.  \n \"Every district, every lane, every village will be under lockdown,\" he said, warning the country would be set back by decades if it didn't shut down and fight the virus.  \n Scores of people turned up at shops in Delhi and Mumbai and elsewhere to buy essentials before the ban orders went into effect.  \n India has found 482 cases of the coronavirus and 10 people have died from the COVID-19 disease it causes but alarm is growing across the region about prospects for its spread into impoverished communities and the ability of resource-starved public health sectors to cope.  \n  \n VIRUS ENTERING SMALL TOWNS  \n Already health officials said the virus was spreading out of big Indian cities where it first appeared into the small towns that dot the landscape.  \n More than 377,300 people have been infected by the coronavirus globally and 16,520 have died since it emerged in China, according to a Reuters tally.  \n China's Wuhan where the virus emerged imposed a two-month lockdown which is only being eased now.  \n Modi acted just a day after the WHO called for aggressive action by India, saying it was critical to the global fight against the disease.  \n India's population is even more densely packed than China's.  \n \"... The future of this pandemic to a greater extent will be determined by what happens with very large, densely populated countries,\" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's emergencies programme, said.  \n \"So it's really, really important that India continues to take aggressive action at the public health level and at the level of society to contain, control and suppress this disease.\"  \n The Indian government said essential services including groceries, fuel stations and banks will remain open. The stock market, located in the financial capital Mumbai, will also operate on Wednesday.  \n  \n PANIC BUYING  \n But ahead of the shutdown starting midnight, people in Delhi and Mumbai were rushing to shops to stock up essentials and in some areas police were deployed to main order.  \n Modi said the government was working to reduce the difficulties for the poor who will be the hardest hit by the shuttering down of Asia's third largest economy. But he did not provide any details.  \n He urged people not to crowd around shops and said there was enough stocks.  \n \"It is a decisive decision - a difficult one, but probably the right one,\" said Partha Chatterjee, professor of economics at Shiv Nadar University near New Delhi.  \n \"The first priority is to save lives and then think of reconstruction.\"  \n Across South Asia, home to a quarter of the world's population, authorities are scrambling to raise their defences as the virus spreads.  \n Four NATO service members in Afghanistan tested positive for coronavirus shortly after entering the country, the first confirmed cases in the mission, NATO said in a statement.  \n \"The service members were newly arrived in country, and were in a precautionary screening facility when they became symptomatic, were moved to isolation and were tested,\" the statement said.  \n Around 1,500 NATO service members, most of whom had recently arrived in Afghanistan, were in screening facilities as a precautionary measure, NATO said.  \n Afghanistan's health ministry said that WHO had estimated that 80 percent of the war ravaged country's 32 million population could be infected with the virus in the next five months. So far it has had 74 cases and one death.  \n Invoking a 56-year-old law, Nepal also ordered a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus after reporting a second case in the Himalayan nation of 30 million people.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK — A mother who was infected with the coronavirus couldn’t smell her baby’s full diaper. Cooks who can usually name every spice in a restaurant dish can’t smell curry or garlic, and food tastes bland. Others say they can’t pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the foul odour of kitty litter. \n Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of infection. \n On Friday (March 20), British ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease’s spread. The published data is limited, but doctors are concerned enough to raise warnings. \n “We really want to raise awareness that this is a sign of infection and that anyone who develops loss of sense of smell should self-isolate,” Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, wrote in an email. “It could contribute to slowing transmission and save lives.” \n She and Professor Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK, a group representing ear, nose and throat doctors in Britain, issued a joint statement urging health care workers to use personal protective equipment when treating any patients who have lost their senses of smell, and advised against performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus. \n Two ear, nose and throat specialists in Britain who have been infected with the coronavirus are in critical condition, Dr Hopkins said. Earlier reports from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus first emerged, had warned that ear, nose and throat specialists as well as eye doctors were infected and dying in large numbers, Hopkins said. \n The British physicians cited reports from other countries indicating that significant numbers of coronavirus patients experienced anosmia, saying that in South Korea, where testing has been widespread, 30 per cent of 2,000 patients who tested positive experienced anosmia as their major presenting symptom (these were mild cases). \n The American Academy of Otolaryngology on Sunday posted information on its website saying that mounting anecdotal evidence indicates that lost or reduced sense of smell and loss of taste are significant symptoms associated with Covid-19, and that they have been seen in patients who ultimately tested positive with no other symptoms. \n Dr Rachel Kaye, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Rutgers, said colleagues in New Rochelle, New York, which has been the center of an outbreak, first alerted her to the smell loss associated with the coronavirus, sharing that patients who had first complained of anosmia later tested positive for the coronavirus. “This raised a lot of alarms for me personally,” Dr Kaye said, because those patients “won’t know to self quarantine.” \n “Most ENTs have on their own accord tried to scale down,” she said, adding that her department at Rutgers had already started using personal protective equipment and stopped performing nonessential exams. \n In the areas of Italy most heavily affected by the virus, doctors say they have concluded that loss of taste and smell is an indication that a person who otherwise seems healthy is in fact carrying the virus and may be spreading it to others. \n “Almost everybody who is hospitalised has this same story,” said Dr Marco Metra, chief of the cardiology department at the main hospital in Brescia, where 700 of 1,200 inpatients have the coronavirus. “You ask about the patient’s wife or husband. And the patient says, ‘My wife has just lost her smell and taste but otherwise she is well.’ So she is likely infected, and she is spreading it with a very mild form.” \n A study from South Korea, where widespread testing has been done, found that 30 per cent of some 2,000 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus reported experiencing anosmia. \n Dr Hendrik Streeck, a German virologist from the University of Bonn who went from house to house in the country’s Heinsberg district to interview coronavirus patients, has said in interviews that at least two-thirds of the more than 100 he talked to with mild disease reported experiencing loss of smell and taste lasting several days. \n Another physician who studied a cluster of coronavirus patients in Germany said in an email that roughly half of the patients had experienced a smell or taste disorder, and that the sensory loss usually presented after the first symptoms of respiratory illness, but could be used to distinguish people who should be tested. \n Dr Clemens Wendtner, a professor of medicine at the Academic Teaching Hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, said that the patients regained their ability to smell after a few days or weeks, and that the loss occurred regardless of how sick they got or whether they were congested. Using nasal drops or sprays did not help, Wendtner said. \n Several American patients who have had symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, but who have not been tested or are still awaiting test results, described losing their senses of smell and taste, even though their noses were clear and they were not congested. \n Mr Andrew Berry, 30, developed a fever and body aches about 10 days ago, and then a sore throat and debilitating headaches. He tested negative for influenza and has not gotten the result of a coronavirus test taken four days ago, but his physician was convinced that he had the virus, he said. \n Now, Mr Berry said, he literally cannot smell the coffee. \n “Even with a clear nose, I just realised I couldn’t smell the food that I was cooking, and I couldn’t taste the food that I was making,” said Mr Berry, a tattoo artist based in Orlando, Florida. He was cooking a plantain dish with onions and vinegar, yet he could not smell it. \n Ms Amy Plattmier, a woman from Brooklyn, was not tested for the coronavirus during a recent illness, but her husband then became sick and had a positive test. Ms Plattmier said she usually had a very sensitive nose, but now could barely smell anything — not the bleach she was using to clean the counters, which usually makes her feel nauseated, or the dog’s accident in the bathroom, which she cleaned up. \n Mr Berry has also lost some weight, because he has not had much of an appetite. “Hopefully it’s not a prolonged effect,” he said. “I can imagine it changes the quality of life.” THE NEW YORK TIMES \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BANGKOK — The coronavirus pandemic sweeping across the planet will force city authorities and planners to more seriously consider factors such as population density, technology, food security and inadequate housing, urban experts said. \n In response to the rising number of infections, countries have tightened border controls, imposed travel bans, locked down cities and stepped up surveillance using technology powered by artificial intelligence (AI). \n \"It is likely that Covid-19 will prompt a rethink of urban design and planning in the Asia-Pacific region,\" said Dr Tony Matthews, a senior lecturer in urban and environmental planning at Australia's Griffith University. \n \"There will probably be consideration of desirable population density levels, a greater utilisation of apps and smart data to track health trends, and many cities will probably start to think about their food security more closely,\" he said. \n Countries including China, South Korea and Singapore are using robots, drones and big data to track the outbreak, disinfect hospitals and deliver supplies. \n Such technologies may become a fixture in cities to flag potential problems for quicker response, said Dr Matthews. \n Authorities are also likely to more closely monitor vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever that are shifting due to climate change, and impose limits on the types and numbers of live animals in traditional markets, he said. \n Coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases — meaning they are passed from animals to humans — and the rapid pace of deforestation and urbanisation are major factors in the spread of these diseases in Asia, health experts say. \n Authorities in China said they would tighten supervision of traditional markets in the cities. \n CATALYSTS \n This would not be the first time that an epidemic has led to changes in city planning, research shows. \n The cholera outbreaks of the 1830s led to better sanitation in London and elsewhere, while the tuberculosis epidemic in New York in the early 20th century paved the way for improved public transit systems and housing regulations. \n The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003, which hit cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore, led Singapore to upgrade its medical infrastructure and create systems to map the disease. \n \"Historically, epidemics have acted as catalysts in transforming how diseases are handled, especially in urban areas,\" said Dr Annie Wilkinson, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, a UK-based think tank. \n \"Community engagement is key to effective epidemic control, be it delivering trusted messages, carrying out surveillance, or limiting movement,\" she said. \n In Singapore, which has among the fastest ageing populations in the world, engaging with older people was key as the coronavirus has a higher mortality rate among seniors. \n Singapore's Ministry of Health worked with community partners to ensure that essential services such as home-based care and transportation continued to reach seniors, a spokeswoman for the ministry said. \n More than 500 volunteers aim to visit about 27,000 seniors to keep them updated on the outbreak and address concerns, she said. Other service providers delivered meals and offered counselling. \n Such decentralisation of services may become more common in cities, said Dr Creighton Connolly, a senior lecturer at the University of Lincoln in England. \n \"Decentralisation of services and reducing density are ways to combat disease spread, though this is contrary to sustainable transport and climate-change related goals,\" he said. \n \"Also, very dense cities like Hong Kong and Singapore have contained the virus better than largely rural areas like Lombardy and Veneto in Italy. Ultimately, governance dimensions are more important than planning or design approaches,\" he said. \n FOOD SECURITY \n More than two-thirds of the global population is forecast to live in urban areas by 2050 — up from 56 per cent today, according to the United Nations. \n With cities battling worsening climate-change effects, planners also have to balance competing demands for land. \n China hurriedly built 16 makeshift hospitals in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, to handle the load. \n In Hong Kong, some public housing blocks were requisitioned for quarantine facilities, while in Italy authorities in Genoa are converting a ferry to a hospital boat. \n \"Planners may consider leaving small parcels of strategic urban land available, in case temporary medical facilities or housing need to be set up,\" said Dr Matthews. \n Alongside, authorities will also need to consider the issue of food security amidst lockdowns and closed borders, he said. \n \"Food security is a huge issue because cities don't tend to produce their food,\" he said. \n Singapore, which imports more than 90 per cent of its food, is encouraging more local production, for example. \n Some cities may create stockpiles, while others may try to produce more food locally through urban farming or through intensive growing facilities using hydroponics, Dr Matthews said. \n \"But the bottom line is most cities rely on global supply lines for food and are therefore vulnerable to disruptions.\" \n Perhaps more importantly, planners will have to consider the impact of widening wealth inequality, with millions of homeless people and those living in slums at greater risk of contracting disease, said Dr Wilkinson. \n \"Achieving longer-term changes in urban planning will depend on improving the way we see, understand and address health and living conditions in informal settlements,\" she said. \n \"For many people living on the margins, crisis is already the norm and change is overdue.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "曼谷-城市专家说，全球范围内的冠状病毒大流行将迫使城市当局和规划者更加认真地考虑人口密度、技术、粮食安全和住房不足等因素。\n为了应对日益增多的感染，各国加强了边境管制，实施了旅行禁令，封锁了城市，并加强了使用人工智能技术的监控。\n澳大利亚格里菲斯大学城市与环境规划高级讲师托尼·马修斯博士说：“Covid-19可能会促使人们重新思考亚太地区的城市设计和规划。”。\n他说：“人们可能会考虑理想的人口密度水平，更多地利用应用程序和智能数据来跟踪健康趋势，许多城市可能会开始更密切地考虑他们的粮食安全。”。\n包括中国、韩国和新加坡在内的国家正在使用机器人、无人机和大数据来追踪疫情、为医院消毒和运送物资。\n马修斯博士说，这些技术可能会成为城市里的固定装置，用来标记潜在的问题，以便更快地做出反应。\n他说，当局还可能更密切地监测因气候变化而转移的登革热等媒介传播疾病，并对传统市场上活动物的种类和数量加以限制。\n健康专家说，冠状病毒是人畜共患疾病，也就是说，冠状病毒是从动物传染给人类的，而森林砍伐和城市化的快速发展是这些疾病在亚洲传播的主要因素。\n中国当局表示，将加强对这些城市传统市场的监管。\n催化剂\n研究显示，这将不是第一次流行病导致城市规划的改.\n19世纪30年代爆发的霍乱使伦敦和其他地方的卫生条件得到改善，而20世纪初纽约的肺结核疫情为改善公共交通系统和住房管理铺平了道路。\n2003的严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）暴发袭击了香港和新加坡等城市，导致新加坡升级其医疗基础设施，并建立系统来映射疾病。\n英国智库发展研究所（Institute of Development Studies）研究员安妮·威尔金森（Annie Wilkinson）博士说：“从历史上看，流行病在改变疾病处理方式方面起到了催化剂的作用，特别是在城市地区。”。\n她说：“社区参与是有效控制流行病的关键，无论是传递可信的信息、进行监测还是限制行动。”。\n新加坡是世界上老龄化最快的国家之一，与老年人接触是关键，因为冠状病毒在老年人中的死亡率较高。\n新加坡卫生部的一位发言人说，卫生部与社区合作伙伴合作，确保家庭护理和交通等基本服务继续惠及老年人。\n她说，500多名志愿者的目标是探访约27000名老年人，让他们了解疫情的最新情况，解决人们的担忧。其他服务提供者提供膳食和咨询服务。\n英国林肯大学（University of Lincoln）高级讲师克雷顿•康诺利（Creighton Connolly）博士表示，这种服务分散可能在城市中变得更加普遍。\n他说：“分散服务和降低密度是对抗疾病传播的方法，尽管这与可持续交通和气候变化相关的目标背道而驰。”。\n“而且，像香港和新加坡这样的非常密集的城市比伦巴第和威内托大区的意大利这样的农村地区更好地控制了病毒。最终，治理层面比规划或设计方法更重要。.\n粮食安全\n据联合国预测，到2050年，全球三分之二以上的人口将生活在城市地区，高于目前的56%。\n随着城市与日益恶化的气候变化影响作斗争，规划者也必须平衡对土地的竞争需求。\n中国仓促在冠状病毒疫情中心城市武汉建设了16家临时医院，以应对疫情。\n在香港，一些公共住房被用于检疫设施，而在意大利，热那亚当局正在将渡船改装为医院船。\n马修斯博士说：“如果需要建立临时医疗设施或住房，规划者可能会考虑留下小块战略城市用地。”。\n他说，除此之外，当局还需要在封锁和关闭边境的情况下考虑粮食安全问题。\n他说：“粮食安全是一个巨大的问题，因为城市往往不生产粮食。\n例如，新加坡90%以上的食品都是进口的，它正在鼓励更多的本地生产。\n马修斯博士说，一些城市可能会建立粮食储备，而另一些城市则可能试图通过城市农业或使用水耕的集约化种植设施在当地生产更多的粮食。\n“但归根结底，大多数城市依赖全球粮食供应线，因此容易受到干扰。”\n威尔金森博士说，也许更重要的是，规划者将不得不考虑日益扩大的财富不平等的影响，数百万无家可归者和那些生活在贫民窟的人更容易感染疾病。\n她说：“要实现城市规划的长期变革，将取决于我们如何看待、了解和处理非正规住区的健康和生活条件。”。\n“对于许多生活在边缘的人来说，危机已经成为常态，变革已经姗姗来迟。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SEOUL - In late January, South Korean health officials summoned representatives from more than 20 medical companies from their lunar New Year celebrations to a conference room tucked inside Seoul’s busy train station.  \n One of the country’s top infectious disease officials delivered an urgent message: South Korea needed an effective test immediately to detect the novel coronavirus, then running rampant in China. He promised the companies swift regulatory approval.  \n Though there were only four known cases in South Korea at that point, “we were very nervous. We believed that it could develop into a pandemic,” one attendee, Lee Sang-won, an infectious diseases expert at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters.  \n “We acted like an army,” he said.  \n A week after the Jan. 27 meeting, South Korea's CDC approved one company’s diagnostic test. Another company soon followed. By the end of February, South Korea was making headlines around the world for its drive-through screening centers and ability to test thousands of people daily.  \n South Korea’s swift action stands in stark contrast to what has transpired in the United States. Seven weeks after the train station meeting, the Koreans have tested well over 290,000 people and identified over 8,000 infections. New cases are falling off: Ninety-three were reported Wednesday, down from a daily peak of 909 two weeks earlier.  \n The United States, whose first case was detected the same day as South Korea’s, is not even close to meeting demand for testing. About 60,000 tests have been run by public and private labs in a country of 330 million, federal officials said Tuesday.  \n As a result, U.S. officials don’t fully grasp how many Americans have been infected and where they are concentrated - crucial to containment efforts. While more than 7,000 U.S. cases had been identified as of Wednesday, as many as 96 million people could be infected in coming months, and 480,000 could die, according to a projection prepared for the American Hospital Association by Dr. James Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  \n “You cannot fight what you cannot see,” said Roger Klein, a former laboratory medical director at the Cleveland Clinic and previously an adviser to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on clinical laboratory issues.  \n How the United States fell so far behind South Korea, according to infectious disease experts, clinicians and state and local officials, is a tale of many contrasts in the two nations’ public health systems: a streamlined bureaucracy versus a congested one, bold versus cautious leadership, and a sense of urgency versus a reliance on protocol.  \n The delayed and chaotic testing in the United States will cost lives, potentially including those of doctors and nurses, many medical experts predict. Already more than 100 people have died overall, and fears of rampant spread have led to extraordinary restrictions on social interaction, upending the U.S. economy, schools, hospitals and everyday life.  \n \"It makes me feel like I’m living in a farce,” said Dr. Ritu Thamman, a cardiologist and clinical assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. Even hospital staff who may have been exposed can’t get a test, she said. “We are a rich country but we don’t have these kinds of things?”  \n The administration of President Donald Trump was tripped up by government rules and conventions, former officials and public health experts say. Instead of drafting the private sector early on to develop tests, as South Korea did, U.S. health officials relied, as is customary, on test kits prepared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of which proved faulty. Then, sticking to its time-consuming vetting procedures, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn’t approve tests other than the CDC’s until Feb. 29, more than five weeks after discussions with outside labs had begun.  \n Meanwhile, in the absence of enough kits, the CDC insisted for weeks on narrow criteria for testing, recommending it only when a person had recently been to China or other hot spots or had contact with someone known to be infected. As a result, the federal government failed to screen an untold number of Americans and missed opportunities to contain the spread, clinicians and public health experts say.  \n South Korea took a risk, releasing briskly vetted tests, then circling back later to spot check their effectiveness. By contrast, the United States’ FDA said it wanted to ensure, upfront, that the tests were accurate before they went out to millions of Americans.  \n “There are always opportunities to learn from situations like this one,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, who has been on the job only three months, told Reuters. “But one thing I will stand firm on: We cannot compromise on the quality of the tests because what would be worse than no tests at all is wildly inaccurate test results.”  \n In a statement, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said, “This process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.” But he said “more and more state labs have come online, increasing our public health system’s ability to detect and respond to cases.”  \n Bombarded by criticism amid a re-election campaign, Trump vowed on Friday to ramp up production of test kits in partnership with private companies and to make the diagnostic tests more widely available at hospitals and in-store parking lots. This week, the FDA said more than 35 universities, hospitals and lab companies had begun running their own tests, under the agency’s revised policy.  \n But it may be weeks before enough tests are on hand to fill the need.  \n “The idea of anybody getting (tested) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we’re not set up for that,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a House committee last week. “That is a failing. Let’s admit it.”  \n It’s a problem many Americans, accustomed to hearing they have the most advanced medical care in the world, find hard to fathom.  \n “I don’t know how we messed this up so badly,” said Ruth Blodgett, 65, whose husband of the same age couldn't get a coronavirus test on Saturday in an urgent care clinic outside Rochester, New York, even though he was coughing and the doctor ordered one for him. ”We got caught flat-footed. For America, that’s unacceptable.”  \n  \n ‘HURRY UP AND DEVELOP THE KITS’  \n At the pivotal Jan. 27 meeting at the Seoul train station, South Korean government leaders told companies they were cleared for takeoff.  \n “They were told that the ‘emergency use authorization’ would be coming, so hurry up and develop the kits,” said Lee Hyukmin, head of the coronavirus task force at the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, who was at the meeting.  \n One of the companies was Kogene Biotech Co Ltd, whose test kit was the only one to work initially. The government announced its approval on Feb. 4.  \n “The government acted quickly,” said Myoah Baek, an executive director at Kogene. The Korean CDC “disclosed information on test methods so test kit makers were able to speed up development.”  \n Lee Hyukmin of the Korean laboratory society said the government was swift - but not reckless.  \n “Of course, a kit that’s approved in one week isn’t as good as one that goes through a year of clinical trials,” he said. So in the early days, Lee said, the government cross-checked cases to ensure the tests were working properly.  \n Cross-checking involved verifying that labs got the same result the government did on an initial pool of patient samples. As of last week, nearly 100 labs were available to perform tests nationwide, according to government figures.  \n South Korea’s rapid response to the new coronavirus resulted from scars of the past.  \n In the aftermath of the 2015 outbreak of MERS, short for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, critics slammed then-President Park Geun-hye and her administration for a slow response and a lack of transparency. Public confidence waned in Park, who was impeached in 2017 following an unrelated corruption scandal.  \n The country had 186 MERS cases, more than anywhere outside the Middle East, including 38 deaths.  \n “We can't ever forget the incident. It is engraved in our mind,” the Korean CDC’s Lee Sang-won said. “We were hurt so much, and we felt remorseful.”  \n  \n ‘A REAL FOUL UP’  \n On Jan. 31, only days after the Seoul train station meeting, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared the novel coronavirus a public health emergency, citing a similar pronouncement from the World Health Organization.  \n HHS oversees the separate operations of the FDA and CDC, key agencies involved in responding to the pandemic. The CDC was responsible for developing the initial test kits for the virus. Then, under longstanding protocols, the FDA needed to approve the test before it could be sent to state and local labs around the country. Private labs and large hospitals could develop their own tests or work off the CDC version.  \n On Feb. 3, amid the preparations to address the emergency, the FDA hosted an all-day conference at its headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, which had been scheduled well before the outbreak. Regulators, researchers and industry representatives gathered to discuss the general process for putting diagnostic tests cleared under emergencies on the path to permanent approval by the FDA.  \n Though coronavirus was now the hottest topic in global medicine, a broadcast of the meeting conveyed little sense of urgency about the epidemic sweeping the globe. It was mentioned in passing but regulators mostly stuck to their Powerpoint presentations.  \n In his remarks, Dr. Timothy Stenzel, who oversees the FDA’s review of diagnostic tests, spoke broadly about the agency’s mission to protect public health: “It's our goal to be first in the world wherever possible to authorize new tests.”  \n Carolyn Hiller, a program director at the Medical Device Innovation Consortium, which hosted the event alongside FDA, said there were discussions with the agency about postponing the meeting because of the coronavirus outbreak, but both sides opted to go ahead.  \n \"The whole coronavirus thing blew up in real time while this was happening,” she said.  \n Stenzel did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the FDA acknowledged that the coronavirus was not a “specific topic on the agenda.” But it said the agency already was talking to test developers and “the conference was timely and addressed issues important” to firms and institutions looking to produce a test.  \n The following day, Feb. 4, the FDA greenlighted a CDC test kit for the virus.  \n Weeks of chaos would follow.  \n By Feb. 8, some states and other public labs were complaining that the CDC’s test wasn’t working because of a flawed component that gave inconclusive results. Three days later, the CDC told the labs that it was manufacturing a new component.  \n As of mid-February, the federal government remained stuck in first gear. The CDC was the primary supplier of tests across much of the country, and other labs couldn’t immediately deploy their own without the FDA’s blessing.  \n HHS said it has assigned a team of outside scientists to examine what went wrong with the CDC’s initial batch of tests, such as whether there was a manufacturing defect, flawed design or contamination in the agency’s lab. The precise problem has not been identified.  \n The CDC didn’t send out new test kits until late February. Meanwhile, public health experts say, a crucial window was closing on containing the virus, which by then was known to have infected more than 60 people.  \n The U.S. emergency declaration issued in late January created additional hurdles that hindered a wider expansion in testing, according to former federal officials and lab professionals.  \n The declaration eased the way for drugmakers to pursue vaccines and antiviral treatments for COVID-19. But public health experts said that the same declaration made it harder to expand diagnostic testing outside the CDC.  \n That’s because the declaration required diagnostic tests developed by individual labs, such as those at hospitals or universities, to undergo greater scrutiny than in non-emergencies - presumably because the stakes are higher.  \n \"Paradoxically, it increased regulations on diagnostics while it created an easier pathway for vaccines and antivirals,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. “There was a real foul-up with diagnostic tests that has exposed a flaw in the United States' pandemic response plan.”  \n Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said the CDC and FDA stuck to their conventional playbook for too long.  \n “Traditional public health thinking is,‘Don’t create widespread panic and don’t go over the top. Keep the testing narrow in a precision rifle approach rather than a mass, shotgun approach,’” Schaffner said. “That failed in this instance. This virus acted differently and it overwhelmed the U.S. system. South Korea had a much better sense of what was happening.”  \n In a statement Tuesday, the CDC said: “After finding out that some labs could not fully verify the test, CDC began working on a solution and identifying the source of the problem …. CDC, in conjunction with FDA, determined how to move forward and shared this information immediately with public health labs.”  \n The CDC statement also suggested that the agency was not exclusively responsible for testing delays.  \n The CDC was “not an impediment” to getting large-scale commercial testing started, according to the statement. That was the role of the FDA, and as the initial U.S. cases were being detected in late January and early February, CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield highlighted the need for that agency to act, according to the CDC statement.  \n Alberto Gutierrez, who led the FDA’s office overseeing diagnostic testing from 2009 to 2017, said the agency proceeded with caution because it saw itself as the last line of defense against opportunistic companies looking to cash in on threats to public health. “There is money to be made in an emergency, and a lot of people try to take advantage of that,” Gutierrez said. \"The problem the FDA faces is, do you let it become the Wild West?”  \n “The FDA had good intentions,” he said.  \n  \n RAMPING UP  \n As U.S. efforts faltered, South Korean officials cleared a test from a second company, Seegene Inc, on Feb. 12.  \n With many more tests in hand, health officials were well armed to attack a fast-moving virus and aggressively track down people who may have been exposed. This testing-backed offensive helped South Korea reduce the number of new cases over a matter of weeks, serving as a model for other countries grappling with the pandemic.  \n In mid-February, cases spiked at a secretive church in the southeastern city of Daegu. On Feb. 26, Daegu city officials said they would test every single member of the church, including those without symptoms.  \n As of March 10, Daegu said that it had tested almost all of the 10,000 members of the church in that area, and about 40% came back positive. The city, which now accounts for about three-quarters of total infections in South Korea, has seen new cases sharply drop. On Wednesday, officials announced 46 new cases compared to a peak of 741 cases on Feb. 29.  \n The country went from two approved test makers on Feb. 18 to five as of last week, according to the Korean CDC.  \n “To my surprise, test kit makers were able to boost production quickly,” Korean CDC’s Lee Sang-won said.  \n  \n PLEADING WITH WASHINGTON  \n By Feb. 24, state and local labs in the United States were pleading with the FDA to relax its rules so the nation no longer had to rely so heavily on the CDC for testing. They asked Hahn, the FDA commissioner, for “enforcement discretion” so they could use their own lab-developed tests.  \n “We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories,” Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and Grace Kubin, lab services director at the Texas Department of State Health Services, wrote to Hahn on Feb. 24 in a letter reviewed by Reuters.  \n In an interview, Becker, whose group represents more than 100 state and local health laboratories, called the letter a “Hail Mary” pass, an act of desperation.  \n “The entire lab community was really coming unglued. We knew we could develop tests and were very capable of doing that, but we felt hamstrung” Becker told Reuters.  \n He said labs wanted FDA to make more tests available so they could run more patient samples at a faster pace.  \n Two days after receiving Becker’s letter, the FDA commissioner said his agency was ready to approve new outside tests quickly - if its requirements for accuracy were satisfied.  \n “False diagnostic test results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences,” Hahn wrote to the Association of Public Health Laboratories in a Feb. 26 letter, “not only serious implications for individual patient care but also serious implications for the analyses of disease progression and for public health decision-making.”  \n Under increasing pressure, the FDA relented and removed many of the bureaucratic obstacles. On Feb. 29, the agency said public and private labs, including academic medical centers, could start using their own tests before the FDA had completed its full review. Laboratories had 15 business days to submit a completed application, which could be approved retroactively.  \n That same day, the Trump administration confirmed the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, a man in his 50s in Washington state.  \n On March 2, Stenzel at the FDA’s diagnostic testing office hosted a webinar for lab test developers, highlighting additional challenges, including a shortage of viral samples needed for validation of test results. Some labs also have reported shortages of other key supplies and ingredients, as well as the need for more trained personnel.  \n As U.S. regulators rewrote their policies, South Korean municipalities were opening roadside testing facilities across the country, collecting samples in minutes while people sat in their cars.  \n At a closed-door meeting last week in Congress, U.S. Representative Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California and an emergency-room physician who treated patients during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak, pressed the FDA commissioner and other members of the Trump administration on why South Korea was lapping the United States in its response.  \n “Why don’t we have drive-through testing like South Korea?” Ruiz asked leaders of the president’s coronavirus task force.  \n Ruiz told Reuters the officials said they were working on it. On their own, some hospitals and communities have begun offering drive-through testing in Colorado, New York, Texas and elsewhere.  \n In recent days, as the public criticism grew louder, Trump appointed a testing czar to improve coordination across agencies. The FDA launched a 24-hour hotline for laboratories needing help to accelerate testing, approved two company applications for higher-volume testing and granted states the flexibility to authorize new tests so labs can bypass the FDA.  \n Despite the new moves, Ruiz said he fears America is still weeks away from approaching what South Korea has accomplished. “I think months have been lost here,” Ruiz said. “Maybe we should look into purchasing South Korea’s tests.”  \n That may happen. Both Kogene and SolGent Co, two of the COVID-19 test-makers approved in South Korea, said their companies have an eye on the U.S. market.  \n “The FDA asked us to proceed with applications quickly,” Kogene executive Myoah Baek said.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "首尔——1月下旬，韩国卫生官员召集了20多家医疗公司的代表参加农历新年庆祝活动，并在首尔繁忙的火车站内的一个会议室里开会。\n韩国的一位高级传染病官员传达了一个紧急信息：韩国需要立即进行有效的检测，以检测这种新型冠状病毒，然后在中国肆虐。他向这些公司承诺迅速获得监管部门的批准。\n尽管当时韩国只有4起已知病例，“但我们非常紧张。韩国疾病预防控制中心的传染病专家李相元（Lee Sang-won）对路透社说：“我们相信，它可能发展成一种流行病。”。\n“我们表现得像一支军队，”他说。\n1月27日会议一周后，韩国疾控中心批准了一家公司的诊断试验。很快又有一家公司接踵而至。到2月底，韩国已经成为世界各地的头条新闻，因为它的快速筛查中心和每天测试数千人的能力。\n韩国的迅速行动与美国的情况形成鲜明对比。在火车站会议召开七周后，韩国人已经检测出超过29万人，确定了超过8000人感染。新病例正在减少：周三报告了93例，低于两周前的每日峰值909例。\n与韩国同一天发现首例病例的美国，甚至还不能满足检测需求。联邦官员星期二说，在一个拥有3.3亿人口的国家，公共和私人实验室已经进行了大约6万次检测。\n因此，美国官员并没有完全掌握有多少美国人受到感染以及他们集中在哪里——这对遏制工作至关重要。而7000多个美国. 内布拉斯加州大学医学中心传染病专家詹姆斯·劳勒博士为美国医院协会准备的一份预测报告显示，截至周三，已经确认有病例，未来几个月可能有9600万人感染，48万人可能死亡。\n克利夫兰诊所前实验室医学主任、美国卫生与人类服务部临床实验室问题顾问罗杰·克莱因说：“你不能与你看不见的东西抗争。”。\n根据传染病专家、临床医生以及州和地方官员的说法，美国是如何远远落后于韩国的，这是两国公共卫生系统中许多不同之处的一个故事：精简的官僚机构与拥挤的官僚机构、大胆而谨慎的领导层、紧迫感与对礼宾的依赖。\n许多医学专家预测，美国延迟和混乱的检测将导致生命损失，可能包括医生和护士的生命损失。目前已经有100多人死亡，对蔓延蔓延的担忧导致了对社会交往的极大限制，颠覆了美国经济、学校、医院和日常生活。\n匹兹堡大学医学院（University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine）心脏病专家、临床助理教授里图•萨曼（Ritu Thaman）博士说：“这让我觉得自己生活在一场闹剧中。她说，即使医院的工作人员可能已经暴露在外，也无法接受检查。“我们是一个富裕的国家，但我们没有这些东西？”\n前官员和公共卫生专家说，唐纳德·特朗普总统的政府被政府的规章和惯例绊倒了。美国卫生官员并没有像韩国那样在早期起草私营部门的测试报告，而是按照惯例依赖美国疾病控制和预防中心准备的测试包，其中一些测试包被证明是错误的. 随后，美国食品药品监督管理局（fda）坚持其耗时的审查程序，直到2月29日才批准CDC以外的检测，这是在与外部实验室的讨论开始五个多星期之后。\n与此同时，由于缺乏足够的试剂盒，疾控中心数周来坚持采用狭隘的检测标准，只有在一个人最近去过中国或其他热点地区，或与已知感染者有过接触时才推荐使用。因此，临床医生和公共卫生专家说，联邦政府未能筛选出数量不计其数的美国人，错失了遏制这种蔓延的机会。\n韩国冒着风险，迅速发布了经过审查的检测结果，然后回头抽查它们的有效性。相比之下，美国食品和药物管理局（FDA）表示，他们希望在数百万美国人接受检测之前，首先确保检测结果的准确性。\n“总有机会从这种情况中吸取教训，”FDA专员斯蒂芬•哈恩（stephenhan）告诉路透社记者，他上任才三个月。“但有一件事我会坚定地坚持：我们不能在测试质量上妥协，因为最糟糕的是测试结果极不准确。”\n疾病预防控制中心发言人本杰明·海恩斯在一份声明中说，“这一过程并没有像我们希望的那样顺利。”但他说，“越来越多的国家实验室上线，提高了我们公共卫生系统发现和应对病例的能力。”\n在连任竞选中受到批评的炮轰，特朗普在周五发誓要与私营公司合作，增加测试包的生产，并使诊断测试在医院和商店停车场更广泛地提供。本周，FDA表示，根据该机构修订后的政策，超过35所大学、医院和实验室公司已经开始进行自己的测试。\n但可能要过几周才能有足够的测试来满足需求.\n美国国家过敏和传染病研究所所长安东尼·福西上周在众议院一个委员会上说：“任何人都能像其他国家的人那样容易地接受（测试）的想法，我们并没有为此做好准备。”。“这是一个失败。我们承认吧。”\n这是一个许多美国人，习惯于听到他们有世界上最先进的医疗保健，发现难以理解的问题。\n“我不知道我们是怎么把事情搞得这么糟的，”65岁的露丝·布洛吉特说，他和他同龄的丈夫周六在纽约罗切斯特郊外的一家急诊诊所无法接受冠状病毒检查，尽管他在咳嗽，医生给他订了一个。“我们被当场抓住了。对美国来说，这是不可接受的。”\n“快点开发工具包”\n在1月27日在首尔火车站举行的关键会议上，韩国政府领导人告诉各公司，他们已获准起飞。\n与会的韩国检验医学会冠状病毒工作组负责人李孝民说：“他们被告知‘紧急使用授权’即将到来，所以要抓紧开发药盒。”。\n其中一家公司是Kogene生物技术有限公司，该公司的测试包是唯一一个开始工作的公司。政府于2月4日宣布批准。\n“政府迅速采取了行动，”Kogene执行董事Myoah Baek说。韩国疾控中心“披露了有关测试方法的信息，以便测试工具制造商能够加快开发速度。”\n韩国实验室协会的李孝民（Lee Hyukmin）表示，政府行动迅速，但并非鲁莽。\n他说：“当然，一周内批准的药盒不如经过一年临床试验的药盒。”。因此，在早期，李说，政府交叉检查案件，以确保测试工作正常。\n交叉检查包括验证实验室得到的结果与政府对最初病人样本池的结果相同. 据政府数据显示，截至上周，全国已有近100家实验室进行检测。\n韩国对新冠状病毒的快速反应是由过去的伤疤造成的。\n2015年中东呼吸综合征（MERS）爆发后，批评人士抨击时任总统朴槿惠及其政府反应迟缓，缺乏透明度。朴槿惠在2017年因一桩不相关的腐败丑闻而被弹劾，公众信心减弱。\n该国有186例MERS病例，比中东以外任何地方都多，包括38例死亡。\n“我们永远不会忘记这件事。它铭刻在我们的脑海中，”韩国疾病预防控制中心的李相元说。“我们受了很大的伤害，我们感到很懊悔。”\n“一次真正的犯规”\n1月31日，就在首尔火车站会议几天后，美国卫生和公共服务部（HHS）援引世界卫生组织（World Health Organization）的类似声明，宣布这种新型冠状病毒为公共卫生紧急事件。\n卫生和公众服务部负责监督FDA和CDC的独立运作，CDC是应对这一流行病的关键机构。疾病预防控制中心负责开发病毒的初始测试包。然后，根据长期的协议，FDA需要批准这项试验，然后才能将其送往全国各地的州和地方实验室。私人实验室和大型医院可以自行开发测试，也可以使用CDC版本。\n2月3日，在应对紧急情况的准备工作中，FDA在位于马里兰州银泉的总部召开了一次全天会议，会议早在疫情爆发前就安排好了。监管机构、研究人员和行业代表齐聚一堂，讨论在紧急情况下通过诊断测试并获得FDA永久批准的一般流程.\n尽管冠状病毒现在是全球医学界最热门的话题，但这次会议的一次广播却没有传达出这种席卷全球的流行病的紧迫感。这是顺便提到，但监管机构大多坚持他们的Powerpoint演示文稿。\n在他的讲话中，主管FDA对诊断测试的审查的Timothy Stenzel博士广泛地谈到了FDA保护公众健康的使命：“我们的目标是尽可能在世界上率先批准新的测试。”\n与FDA一起主办这次活动的医疗器械创新联盟（Medical Device Innovation Consortium）的项目总监卡罗琳•希勒（Carolyn Hiller）表示，由于冠状病毒爆发，双方曾与FDA讨论推迟会议，但双方都选择了继续。\n她说：“当这一切发生时，整个冠状病毒事件都被实时引爆了。”。\n斯坦泽尔没有回应记者的置评请求。在一份声明中，FDA承认冠状病毒并不是一个“议程上的特定话题”，但它表示，FDA已经在与测试开发者进行对话，并且“会议是及时的，并且解决了对希望进行测试的公司和机构来说很重要的问题”。\n第二天，2月4日，美国食品和药物管理局（FDA）发布了CDC病毒检测试剂盒。\n接下来将是数周的混乱。\n到2月8日，一些州和其他公共实验室抱怨说，疾病预防控制中心的测试没有起作用，因为有缺陷的组件导致了不确定的结果。三天后，疾控中心告诉实验室它正在制造一种新的部件。\n截至2月中旬，联邦政府仍处于第一档。疾控中心是全国大部分地区检测的主要供应商，没有FDA的批准，其他实验室无法立即部署自己的实验室。\n卫生和公众服务部说，他们已经指派了一个外部科学家小组来检查疾病控制中心最初的一批检测出了什么问题，例如该机构的实验室是否存在制造缺陷、设计缺陷或污染. 具体问题尚未查明。\n疾控中心直到2月底才派发新的检测试剂盒。与此同时，公共卫生专家说，一个关键的窗口正在关闭，以遏制病毒，当时已知已感染60多人。\n据前联邦官员和实验室专业人士说，1月下旬发布的美国紧急声明制造了额外的障碍，阻碍了测试范围的扩大。\n该声明为制药商寻求COVID-19的疫苗和抗病毒治疗铺平了道路。但是公共卫生专家说，同样的声明使得在疾病预防控制中心之外扩大诊断测试更加困难。\n这是因为该声明要求由个别实验室（如医院或大学的实验室）开发的诊断测试要比非紧急情况下接受更严格的审查——大概是因为风险更高。\n约翰霍普金斯大学健康安全中心的高级学者阿梅什·阿达尔贾博士说：“矛盾的是，它加强了对诊断的监管，同时为疫苗和抗病毒药物创造了一条更为便捷的途径。”。“诊断测试确实出了问题，暴露了美国大流行应对计划的缺陷。”\n范德比尔特大学医学院预防医学和传染病学教授威廉·沙夫纳博士说，疾控中心和食品药品管理局太长时间以来都坚持他们的传统做法。\n“传统的公共卫生思想是，不要制造广泛的恐慌，不要过分。沙夫纳说：“在精确的来复枪方法而不是大规模的散弹枪方法中，保持测试范围狭窄。“在这种情况下失败了。这种病毒的行为不同，它淹没了美国的系统。韩国对正在发生的事情有了更好的了解.”\n在星期二的一份声明中，疾控中心说：“在发现一些实验室无法完全验证检测结果后，疾控中心开始研究解决方案，并确定问题的根源…。疾病预防控制中心与食品和药物管理局共同决定了如何向前发展，并立即与公共卫生实验室共享这些信息。”\n疾控中心的声明还指出，该机构并非只对检测延误负责。\n根据这份声明，疾病预防控制中心“不是阻碍”大规模商业测试的开始。这是FDA的职责所在，根据CDC的声明，由于最初的美国病例在1月底和2月初被发现，CDC主任Robert Redfield博士强调了该机构采取行动的必要性。\n2009年至2017年领导FDA监督诊断测试办公室的阿尔贝托•古铁雷斯（Alberto Gutierrez）表示，FDA之所以谨慎行事，是因为它认为自己是防范那些希望从公共健康威胁中获利的机会主义公司的最后一道防线。古铁雷斯说：“在紧急情况下可以赚钱，很多人试图利用这一点。”FDA面临的问题是，你让它变成了野生西部吗？”\n他说：“FDA的初衷是好的。\n加速\n由于美国的努力步履蹒跚，韩国官员于2月12日通过了第二家公司Seegene公司的测试。\n随着越来越多的检测工作的进行，卫生官员已经准备好攻击快速传播的病毒，并积极追踪可能被感染的人群。这一试验支持的攻势帮助韩国在数周内减少了新病例的数量，为其他国家应对这一流行病提供了一个模式。\n2月中旬，在东南部城市大邱的一个秘密教堂，病例激增。2月26日，大邱市官员表示，他们将对教堂的每一位成员进行测试，包括那些没有症状的成员.\n大邱说，截至3月10日，它对该地区10000名教会成员进行了几乎所有的检测，约40%的检测结果呈阳性。该市目前约占韩国总感染人数的四分之三，新病例数量急剧下降。周三，官方宣布了46起新案件，而2月29日的最高点是741起。\n据韩国疾病预防控制中心（CDC）称，截至上周，韩国已从2月18日的两个经批准的检测制造商增至5家。\n韩国疾控中心的李相元说：“令我惊讶的是，试纸盒制造商能够迅速提高产量。”。\n恳求华盛顿\n到2月24日，美国的州和地方实验室请求FDA放宽其规定，这样国家就不再那么依赖CDC进行检测。他们要求食品和药物管理局局长哈恩（Hahn）做出“执法决定”，以便他们可以使用自己实验室开发的测试。\n公共卫生实验室协会（Association of Public Health laboratories）首席执行官斯科特•贝克尔（Scott Becker）和得克萨斯州卫生服务部（Texas Department of State Health services）实验室服务主任格蕾丝•库宾（Grace Kubin）在给哈恩的信中说：“我们现在已经采取了许多周的应对措施，绝大多数成员实验室在疾病预防控制中心之外仍然没有诊断或监测检测。”2月24日路透社的一封评论信中说。\n贝克尔的小组代表了100多个州和地方卫生实验室，他在一次采访中称这封信为“万福玛丽”通行证，是一种绝望的行为。\n“整个实验室的人都真的失去了兴趣。贝克尔告诉路透社记者：“我们知道我们可以进行测试，而且非常有能力做到这一点，但我们感到自己的能力受到了限制。”。\n他说，实验室希望FDA能提供更多的检测，以便他们能够更快地检测更多的病人样本。\n在收到贝克的信两天后，FDA专员说，如果准确度的要求得到满足，FDA将很快批准新的外部测试.\n哈恩在2月26日给公共卫生实验室协会的一封信中写道：“错误的诊断测试结果可能会导致严重的公共卫生后果，不仅对个体病人的护理产生严重影响，而且对疾病进展的分析和公共卫生决策也会产生严重影响。”\n在越来越大的压力下，FDA放松了态度，消除了许多官僚障碍。2月29日，该机构表示，公共和私人实验室，包括学术医疗中心，可以在FDA完成全面审查之前开始使用自己的测试。实验室有15个工作日提交完整的申请，可追溯批准。\n同一天，特朗普政府证实了美国首例冠状病毒致死病例，一名50多岁的男子在华盛顿州。\n3月2日，FDA诊断测试办公室的Stenzel为实验室测试开发人员举办了一个网络研讨会，强调了额外的挑战，包括验证测试结果所需的病毒样本短缺。一些实验室还报告说，其他关键物资和原料短缺，以及需要更多训练有素的人员。\n随着美国监管机构重新改写政策，韩国各市政府正在全国范围内开放路边检测设施，在几分钟内收集样本，而人们则坐在车里。\n上周在国会举行的一次闭门会议上，在2009年H1N1流感爆发期间为病人提供治疗的加州民主党议员、急诊室医生劳尔·鲁伊斯（Raul Ruiz）向FDA专员和特朗普政府其他成员施压，要求他们说明韩国为何在应对措施上轻视美国。\n“我们为什么不像韩国那样进行试驾呢？鲁伊斯问总统冠状病毒特别工作组的领导人。\n鲁伊斯告诉路透社，官员们说他们正在努力解决这个问题. 一些医院和社区已经开始在科罗拉多州、纽约州、德克萨斯州和其他地方进行直接检测。\n最近几天，随着公众批评声越来越大，特朗普任命了一名测试沙皇，以改善各机构之间的协调。FDA开通了一条24小时热线，为需要帮助加速测试的实验室服务，批准了两家公司申请更大批量测试，并授予各州批准新测试的灵活性，这样实验室就可以绕过FDA。\n鲁伊斯说，尽管有了新的举措，他担心美国距离实现韩国的成就还有几周的时间。鲁伊斯说：“我想这里已经失去了几个月的时间。“也许我们应该考虑购买韩国的测试。”\n这可能发生。在韩国获批的COVID-19测试制造商中，Kogene和SolGent公司都表示，他们的公司着眼于美国市场。\n“FDA要求我们尽快开始申请，”Kogene的执行官Myoah Baek说。路透社",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The World Health Organization has warned of the risk that COVID-19 could overwhelm strained public health systems in sub-Saharan Africa. Here is a selection of measures countries are taking to prepare for the virus and limit its spread.  \n  \n SOUTH AFRICA  \n With more cases than any other country in sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa is barring entry to foreign travellers coming from or transiting through high-risk countries including Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom and China, according to an advisory issue by the foreign ministry on Tuesday.  \n Travellers who arrived from these countries since mid-February must report for testing. Those arriving from medium-risk countries – Portugal, Hong Kong and Singapore – will undergo high intensity screening.  \n South Africans are advised to cancel or postpone all non-essential foreign travel. The government has also ordered schools to close early for the Easter break and will prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people.  \n  \n NIGERIA  \n Africa's most populous nation is from Friday banning entry to arrivals from 13 of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus, including the United States, Britain, Germany and China.  \n It has also stepped up surveillance and is preparing for the possibility of an influx of patients.  \n Lagos, the biggest city with some 20 million people, could handle 2,000 cases, said Bamidele Mutiu, who heads a regional biosafety team. To do this, they would need to use two camps previously housing people displaced by violence, he said.  \n Authorities are checking the temperature of anyone who arrives at Nigeria's airports, ports and land borders.  \n Those coming from high-risk countries such as China, Iran, Italy and Spain are asked to self-isolate for 14 days, said Tarik Mohammed, a technical advisor at the Niger Centre for Disease Control. If they develop symptoms, a laboratory team will visit them and collect a sample for testing.  \n  \n KENYA  \n The East African country is suspending travel from any nation with reported COVID-19 cases.  \n Only Kenyan citizens, foreigners with residence permits and United Nations workers will be allowed to come in, provided they proceed on self-quarantine, the government said this week.  \n Schools and universities are closing, and public minibuses are providing hand sanitizer.  \n  \n ETHIOPIA  \n Ethiopian Airlines said on its website that medics stationed at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport, a key regional transit hub, carry out continuous health screenings 24/7.  \n The government in the Horn of Africa country has closed schools nationwide and offered to transport people on government buses to ease congestion on public transport.  \n  \n RWANDA  \n The East African country is flooding its capital, Kigali, with portable sinks for hand-washing at bus stops, restaurants, banks and shops. Schools, universities, churches and courts are closed nationwide. Some flights are suspended.  \n  \n CAMEROON  \n From Wednesday, Cameroon, in central Africa, will close land, air and sea borders indefinitely, the government said in statement on Tuesday. International flights will be grounded, with the exception of cargo planes. Schools and restaurants will shut, and gatherings of more than 50 people are banned.  \n  \n LIBERIA  \n The West African country is applying lessons learned fighting a devastating Ebola outbreak in 2014-15.  \n \"We were one of the first countries to start enhanced screening at the airport on Jan. 25,\" said Mosoka P. Fallah, acting director general of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia.  \n More than 200 people have been trained as field epidemiologists and check for diseases in all 90 districts, said Tolbert Nyenswah, senior research associate at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the United States and former incident manager for Liberia’s Ebola response.  \n \"If there is a case of a suspected disease, a sample is sent to a lab and tested.\"  \n There are hand-washing stations at public places including stores, shops, schools, hospitals, restaurant and government offices.  \n  \n SENEGAL  \n Has been taking all passengers' temperatures since Jan. 28 and asks for contact details, so officials can reach them if someone else on the plane tests positive, a spokesman for Dakar airport said.  \n  \n GHANA  \n Has implemented some of the most stringent measures in West Africa with a mandatory 14 days of quarantine for all people arriving from abroad. Travelers from countries with over 200 cases of coronavirus are barred from entering the country unless they are Ghanaian citizens or residents.  \n  \n MAURITANIA  \n After confirming its first case on March 13, the West African country closed the international airport, suspended teaching in schools and universities, and banned weekly markets.  \n  \n MADAGASCAR  \n One of the world’s poorest countries, the island nation has suspended all flights for 30 days, a blow to its tourism industry.

        "news_content_translate_en": "As global makers of household cleaners race to pitch their products as coronavirus killers, one major company, Reckitt Benckiser, may have a leg up on the competition.  \n The maker of Lysol and Dettol disinfectants said it has already obtained a strain of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, from an independent lab and plans to use the strain to test whether its products kill the virus.  \n Watchdogs in the United States and Europe stipulate that a product must be tested in a regulator-approved lab to prove it can be effective against 99.9% of a virus before it can make a virus-killing claim on its label or in ads. In 2012, for instance, when MERS-coronavirus was a major public health concern, cleaning products had to prove they could kill 9,999 out of 10,000 MERS-Coronavirus cells, according to the agencies’ requirement.  \n COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China, and has spread to more than 100 countries across the world.  \n The pandemic presents both a challenge and an opportunity for marketers of household brands to show how their products can help consumers deal with a frightening and fast-developing public health crisis. Doing it right could mean added market share; doing it badly will likely have other consequences.  \n \"This coronavirus is the new hype,\" said Michael Reynen, the former research head of Procter & Gamble's surface care business in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  \n British consumer goods maker Reckitt told Reuters it procured a sample of the novel coronavirus strain a few days ago and will soon be testing its existing disinfectants for commercial use at a virology lab.  \n The lab, which Reckitt declined to name, is in the process of duplicating the virus samples to enable sufficient quantities for testing, it said. The lab can test six Reckitt Benckiser products per week, with results of the first batch expected by the end of April, the company said.  \n Before Reckitt can re-label and stock shelves with its Dettol disinfecting sprays and Lysol toilet cleaners, it must complete a battery of regulator-mandated tests that typically take at least six months. It could take over a year if they need to create entirely new coronavirus-killing products.  \n Reckitt’s move, which Reuters could not independently verify, could put some of its rivals on the back foot.  \n At stake are potentially billions of dollars in sales. Consumers spent nearly $22 billion on surface cleaners globally and another $1.43 billion on cleaning wipes in 2019. Clorox has about 4% percent and 37% percent of the surface cleaner and disinfecting wipes categories, respectively, followed by Reckitt, with share of 7.3% and 17.2%.  \n During public health emergencies, such as 'Bird flu,' the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 and the 2013 MERS crisis, demand for surface cleaners and disinfecting wipes typically spikes, a Reuters analysis of Euromonitor data shows.  \n  \n 'RUSHING AROUND'  \n Reynen, who held several top research roles in his 24 years at P&G, said companies can spend a few thousand dollars to buy aggressive virus strains like the novel coronavirus from regulator-approved microbiology laboratories, which mail the samples with a glycerin solution in small, deep-frozen vessels.  \n “Procter and Clorox will be rushing around to get a strain,” he said. “If they don't have it in their labs by now, I'd expect they will in the next week or two.”  \n P&G, Clorox and Unilever declined to comment on whether they’re pursuing or have managed to get samples of the novel coronavirus.  \n The companies likely do not have labs sophisticated enough to complete the rigorous six-month testing for a virus as nasty as this, so they outsource most of the work to external labs approved by regulators, a process that could cost about $100,000-$200,000, Reynen said. The contracted labs typically work with top biomedical research organizations such as the private non-profit Institut Pasteur in Paris and the German government agency Robert Koch-Institut in Berlin.  \n As deaths and illnesses from the novel coronavirus mount, companies are resorting to the most powerful claims they can make. The U.S. EPA and European Chemicals Agency do allow for certain carefully-worded statements even in the absence of testing against a strain of the novel coronavirus.  \n For example, Lysol, P&G and Clorox recently created websites promoting awareness, claiming some of their disinfectant products \"demonstrated effectiveness against viruses similar to 2019 Novel Coronavirus\" and \"can be used\" against coronavirus on certain surfaces. P&G also put out a new line of sanitizing products called Microban 24 in late February with TV ads touting they were better than rival Lysol, but the company said the launch was not connected to the coronavirus outbreak.  \n Retail sales for Lysol wipes and rival Clorox wipes rose 184% in the week ended Feb. 29 versus last year, according to data firm Bloomreach. At the same time, shares of Reckitt, P&G and Clorox have outperformed the broader market, which has plunged since the first case of Coronavirus was detected in China on Dec. 31. REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "随着全球家用清洁剂制造商竞相将其产品推销为冠状病毒杀伤者，一家主要公司Reckitt Benckiser可能会在竞争中占上风。\n溶醇消毒剂和滴滴涕消毒剂的制造商说，他们已经从一个独立的实验室获得了一种新型冠状病毒，称为SARS-CoV-2，并计划用这种病毒来测试其产品是否能杀死病毒。\n美国和欧洲的监管机构规定，产品必须在监管机构批准的实验室中进行测试，以证明其能够有效抵御99.9%的病毒，然后才能在其标签或广告上进行病毒杀灭声明。例如，2012年，当MERS冠状病毒成为公众健康的一大问题时，根据该机构的要求，清洁产品必须证明它们可以杀死10000个MERS冠状病毒细胞中的9999个。\nCOVID-19是一种由新型冠状病毒引起的疾病，起源于中国武汉，目前已传播到全球100多个国家。\n这场大流行给家居品牌的营销人员带来了挑战和机会，让他们展示自己的产品如何帮助消费者应对一场可怕的、快速发展的公共卫生危机。做得好可能意味着增加市场份额；做得不好可能带来其他后果。\n“这种冠状病毒是一种新的炒作，”宝洁（Procter&Gamble）在欧洲、中东和非洲部分地区的表面护理业务前研究主管迈克尔•雷恩（MichaelReynen）说。\n英国消费品制造商雷基特（Reckitt）对路透社表示，该公司几天前采购了一种新型冠状病毒株的样本，不久将在一家病毒学实验室对现有消毒剂进行商用测试。\n雷基特拒绝透露实验室的名字，该实验室正在复制病毒样本，以便能够进行足够数量的检测. 该公司说，该实验室每周可以测试6种瑞奇特本基产品，第一批产品的测试结果预计将在4月底公布。\n在Reckitt能够重新贴上标签并用其Dettol消毒喷雾剂和Lysol马桶清洁剂存放货架之前，它必须完成一系列监管机构规定的测试，通常至少需要6个月。如果他们需要开发全新的冠状病毒杀灭产品，可能需要一年多的时间。\n路透社无法独立核实雷基特的这一举动，可能会让一些竞争对手背黑锅。\n潜在的数十亿美元的销售额将受到威胁。2019年，全球消费者在表面清洁剂上花费了近220亿美元，在清洁湿巾上又花费了14.3亿美元。Clorox在表面清洁剂和消毒湿巾类别中分别占4%和37%，其次是Reckitt，分别占7.3%和17.2%。\n路透社对欧睿数据的分析显示，在“禽流感”、2009年H1N1大流行和2013年MERS危机等公共卫生紧急情况下，对表面清洁剂和消毒湿巾的需求通常会激增。\n“四处奔波”\n雷恩在宝洁24年的工作中担任过几项顶级研究职位，他说，公司可以花几千美元从监管机构批准的微生物学实验室购买攻击性病毒株，比如新型冠状病毒，这些实验室将甘油溶液邮寄到深冻的小容器中。\n他说：“普罗克斯特和克罗克斯会四处奔波，以缓解压力。”。“如果他们现在实验室里还没有，我想他们会在未来一两周内拿到。”\n宝洁、Clorox和联合利华拒绝就他们是否在寻找或设法获得新型冠状病毒样本发表评论.\n雷恩说，这些公司可能没有足够成熟的实验室来完成对像这样恶劣的病毒的严格的6个月测试，因此他们将大部分工作外包给监管机构批准的外部实验室，这一过程可能需要大约10万到20万美元。签约的实验室通常与顶级生物医学研究机构合作，如巴黎的私营非营利性巴斯德研究所和柏林的德国政府机构罗伯特·科赫研究所。\n随着新型冠状病毒导致的死亡和疾病不断增加，企业正诉诸于他们能提出的最有力的声明。美国环保署和欧洲化学品署确实允许某些措辞谨慎的声明，即使没有对新型冠状病毒株进行检测。\n例如，Lysol、P&G和Clorox最近创建了提高认识的网站，声称他们的一些消毒剂产品“显示了类似于2019年新型冠状病毒的有效性”，并“可用于”某些表面上的冠状病毒。宝洁公司在2月底还推出了一款名为Microban 24的新型消毒产品，电视广告宣传其优于竞争对手Lysol，但该公司表示，此次上市与冠状病毒爆发无关。\n数据公司Bloomreach的数据显示，截至2月29日的一周，Lysol湿巾和竞争对手Clorox湿巾的零售额较去年增长了184%。与此同时，Reckitt、宝洁和Clorox的股价表现优于大盘，自12月31日中国发现首例冠状病毒以来，大盘大幅下挫。路透社",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The current Covid-19 pandemic marks an important turning point in increasing confidence and optimism in recent years.\nAt a time when predictions for 2020 were no longer the most optimistic, showing signs of a synchronised global slowdown, Vovid-19 catalysed this reaction, disseminating what appears to have started in a market in China in almost certain and imminent global economic recession.\nIn the midst of the age of artificial intelligence and digitisation, where everything happens very quickly, epidemics also rise to unthinkable rhythms. The special nature of the global world in which we live, where practically no country lives alone, has become the perfect ecosystem for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and trade, production chains, tourism, migration flows or free movement are vectors for transmission.\nEvery time basic principles are at stake, such as health, everything else will have to be pushed into the background. However, the analysis and evaluation of their impact on the economy is of paramount importance.\nAs a result of the spread of this outbreak, various economic impacts are expected. Firstly, the overall impact of the collapse of the Chinese economy, at least in the first quarters of this year. Then the supply-side shock, resulting from the failures in production chains and absenteeism (the productivity of teleworking will have to be assessed after this situation we are living in). However, due account must also be taken of the decrease in demand, the result of greater uncertainty and the postponement of investment decisions. And finally, the expected impact on company liquiditYeah.\nFrom a macroeconomic point of view, despite some recent improvements, Portugal still has serious susceptibility, as the Economists have reiterated both through its Quarterly Fiscality Barometer, in the various public interventions and in the think-tank Mission Growth.\nOur country has the third largest debt in Europe as a percentage of the GDP (119,5%), the weight of interest being the second highest in the European Union, implying excessive exposure to external risks.\nIn addition, the sustainability of public accounts depends on a high tax burden on businesses and households, which will see their income decrease as a result of automatic stabilisers linked to the decrease in economic activity.\nOn the contrary, it is expected that public expenditure, with its rigid character, will be increased by increasing (more than necessary, in this period) expenditure on health, by providing additional social benefits or by measures to promote the economy.\nOf course, the forecasts in the OE/2020 no longer make sense in the light of the current climate. Growth targets, debt reduction, maintaining low unemployment rates, stability of funding rates or the long awaited and celebrated budget surplus will certainly not meet expectations.\nThis is the most obvious demonstration of the greatest risk resulting from the failure to implement important long-identified but always delayed structural reforms, even at a time when threats were already visible (the trade war between China and the US, geopolitical tensions, the Brexit or the situation of the Italian financial system). The country is therefore more exposed to external shocks, and now the unexpected Covid-19 pandemiYeah.\nThis virus, the so-called black swan, in addition to the serious and numerous impacts on health, has already resulted in the largest stock-market crash ever of the PSI-20 in this century, an oil war involving Russia and Saudi Arabia and the increasing closure of borders by various states. With regard to economic impact, the OECD has already revised world growth from 2,9% to 2,4% being the most pessimistic scenario of 1,5% at European level, and the European Commission estimated an impact of 2,5 percentage points against the initial estimate of growth(1,4% of GDP), setting the new estimate in a possible 1%of GDP recession.\nGiven all this, what can be done to mitigate this economic impact? The answer will have to be given in a concerted way and at European level, and much more proactivity is needed, as well as a strengthening of debt purchasing programmes, ensuring that the debt risk of the southern countries does not rise and that the new debt that is generated at European level is mutualised. The U.E. cannot fail and has an opportunity to show that its ability to resolve a situation like this exists and will be exercised successfully.\nOn the business side, fiscal and credit payments need to be made more flexible in order to avoid the insolvency of companies due to lack of liquidity, as well as the launch of investment support programmes and the minimisation of costs generated by Covid-19.\nOn the side of households, support should be provided beyond what has already been announced, for cases with more dependents and less income, as well as greater flexibility in payment of loans for housing, electricity and water.\nThe times we are living in are difficult for everyone. Also for the political decision-makers in the various countries affected by this pandemic. But we can overcome them, working together and in tuneYeah. After all, epidemics have a cyclical character and the history of mankind shows us that. And in the end, we have to face the strangeness of the present that we are living with the possible normality, let alone to remind us of the lesson that swans are not always white.\n*Staff of the Order of Economist",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The COVID-19 outbreak, which reportedly originated from Wuhan, China, has been particularly tough on Chinese netizens. Most of them had to be quarantined at home, where even those who couldn’t boil an egg had to start figuring out their meal prep (food deliveries in particularly affected cities like Hubei are few and far between).On Chinese social media platform Weibo, bored users started the trending hashtag #QuarantineDiaries as they document their lives at home on mandatory leave. Food photos dominated the posts, with netizens sharing home cooking tutorials and gushing about getting their hands on once commonly-available ingredients that became scarce during their city's lockdown. \n One Weibo user uploaded a photo of a sweet potato, which she had bought from an online group buy spree that finally got delivered to her house. “I have not eaten this for over a month,” she wrote. “I was so touched [when I finally got to eat it] that I cried… and my tears flowed out from the corners of my mouth.” \n Reganmian (‘Hot dry noodles’ in Chinese) is a Wuhan breakfast staple. It’s a basic bowl of dry noodles tossed with soy sauce, sesame paste, pickled vegetables, chopped garlic and chilli oil. A Chinese healthcare worker updated her Weibo log with photos of an ad hoc hot dry noodles assembly station at her hospital workplace, where she and her colleagues DIY-ed quick meals. She muses, “The virus has made us omnipotent. We mop the floors, clear the trash and also make our own hot dry noodles. I’m impressed.” \n There are also quarantined netizens who cook up creative recipes with the free time on their hands. In response to the severe mask shortage, home cooks on Weibo made pancake ‘masks’ from scratch with just a few simple ingredients. One helpful user even uploaded a step-by-step guide to make the viral pancake masks. We have translated it below in case, uh, you wanna make your own. \n  \n The netizen stresses that sugar must be added, or the mask “won’t be nice to eat”. \n “The egg yolk is added to give the mask a nice golden colour, and make it crispier,” explains the netizen. \n Cover the dough with cling wrap and let it rest for half an hour. \n Roll each individual small ball into a flat rectangle shape, and sprinkle some plain flour on it so it doesn’t stick to surfaces. The netizen adds, “Roll [the disc] thinner, as it will become thicker when you fold it into the shape of a mask.” \n Pleat the ‘folds’ and add dough ‘straps’. Then poke 'stitches' along the edges of the mask with a fork or toothpick for extra realism. “But it’s okay if you don’t do it, ’cos [the holes don’t show up] after you cook it anyway,” says the netizen. \n  \n Netizen: “Why did I call it a single-use mask? Because it’s gone after I eat it hahaha.” \n If surgical masks are too mainstream for you, there’s the N95 steamed mantou version. \n There are also pancake masks flavoured with vegetable and fruit juices for variety. \n Like these doughy bats, which the Weibo folks confidently claim “are definitely edible” (the novel coronavirus purportedly originated from people consuming infected wild bats). \n Another netizen also concocted ‘COVID-19 meatballs’ by pushing enoki mushrooms into handmade minced beef balls to mimic the virus strain. \n The end result looks horrifying, as it should be. \n In a bid to eat healthily to boost their immune system, some folks also made fried ‘onion rings’ with cored apple slices.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — There are now 17 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections from the latest cluster involving a private function at Safra Jurong, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (March 6). \n Of these, nine cases were among the 13 new Covid-19 infections that were reported on Friday — the highest number of cases reported in a day so far. \n HOW MANY PEOPLE ATTENDED THE EVENT? \n Speaking to reporters, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the authorities do not yet know the exact number of guests who were present at the dinner function on Feb 15. \n In a statement on Thursday, Safra said that the event was held at the Joy Garden Restaurant on its premises, which was then closed for cleaning from Feb 16 to 19. All visitors had their temperatures checked and were required to make declarations about their recent travel history, it added. \n “They did not have fever or exhibited any flu-like symptoms. They also did not have any recent travel history to mainland China within the past 14 days of their visit to the club as stated within their declaration,” Safra said. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that investigations are ongoing to assess how many people attended the dinner and which people might have had close contact with individuals who the authorities now know to have infections. \n WHAT KIND OF EVENT WAS IT?  \n Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH, said that the private event was a sit-down dinner and a social event organised by a couple of individuals for friends and their other family members. \n Assoc Prof Mak said that people were seated at more than one table, and they were moving around the private function room throughout the dinner. \n WHY DID IT TAKE A WHILE TO FIND LINKS? \n Not all of the 17 confirmed cases from the cluster at Safra Jurong attended the private dinner function, Assoc Prof Mak said. Some of the infected people linked to the cluster were not present, but were family members of those who had attended the function. \n It took “some time” to establish how the infected people in the cluster were linked, he said. \n This came only after extensive recording, investigations of the movements of the infected people and contact tracing. Then the authorities were able to identify the activity that the confirmed cases had in common — that is, the private function at Safra Jurong. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that the authorities had to interview these individuals, trying to find out what their movements were, assessing who they had come into contact with and then interviewing those other people as well. \n “That takes time. And this explains why it is taking so long to establish the various people involved, to also make a diagnosis on these individuals as well,” he said, adding that contact tracing and investigations are continuing. \n Assoc Prof Mak warned that there is a possibility that more cases linked to this cluster will emerge over the next few days. \n WHY ARE SOME CASES ONLY EMERGING NOW? \n A number of cases from the Safra Jurong cluster presented themselves to the authorities “days after they were symptomatic”, Assoc Prof Mak said. \n Some of the infected people continued with social activities and went to work despite having respiratory symptoms, he added. \n “We’ve always been telling members of the public that if you are sick, please don’t mix around, (don’t) continue with your social activities (or) work activities. If you are sick, see a doctor early and isolate.”  \n When people do not heed the call to not go out to gatherings when they have flu-symptoms or are sick, it makes it harder to contain the disease and \"exposes other people who otherwise would have been well to the Covid-19 infection\", he said. \n \"And this thus makes our task even more challenging in trying to identify who the close contacts might be, and then isolating them and putting them on surveillance.” \n Assoc Prof Lee emphasised the same point: “It is all a cluster, as a result of someone symptomatic who went for the event. \n “So, as long as people adhere to these social responsibilities and don’t go around when they are ill, then we can see that this entire incident would not have happened.” \n Asked what had been done to the identified attendees at the private function, Assoc Prof Lee explained that it had been more than 14 days since the event took place, so only those who reported that they were unwell had to go to the hospital for checks. \n “Those who were well throughout would not have been quarantined because they had already passed that 14-day exposure period,” he said. \n WHO ELSE ARE LINKED TO THE CLUSTER? \n Aside from the nine newly confirmed cases on Friday, eight other cases reported previously have been linked to the cluster at Safra Jurong. \n They are: Case 96, a Year 1 Raffles Institution student, who is linked to Case 94, a 64-year-old Singaporean woman who is then linked to Case 112, an assistant cook at Creative O Preschoolers’ Bay. None of the cases has recently travelled to China, or Daegu city or Cheongdo county in South Korea. \n Case 107, a 68-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Jakarta, Indonesia from Feb 11 to 14, while Case 117, a 52-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Malaysia on March 1. \n Other cases linked to the Safra Jurong cluster are Cases 114, 115 and 116 who were confirmed on Thursday. \n WHAT PRECAUTIONS DID SAFRA JURONG TAKE?  \n In a statement on its website on Thursday, Safra said that the individuals who had attended the private dinner function and who then tested positive for Covid-19 had cleared mandatory temperature checks it had conducted. \n It said that all visitors and employees at Safra Jurong had undergone temperature checks which had been introduced in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, along with other measures such as increased cleaning and disinfection of facilities. \n All visitors have to make declarations about their travel history and to provide contact details, the statement added. \n In a Facebook post early on Friday, Safra said that the restaurant, along with all other possible areas which might have been visited by the affected individuals, was to be “thoroughly cleaned and disinfected again starting (March 6)”. \n In a separate Facebook post, Safra Jurong said that the restaurant will be closed from March 6 to 12. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡-卫生部周五（3月6日）表示，目前已有17例确诊的Covid-19感染病例，来自Safra Jurong的一个私人部门的最新病例群。\n其中，9例是星期五报告的13例新的Covid-19感染病例中的一例，这是迄今为止一天报告的最高病例数。\n有多少人参加了这次活动？\n卫生部医务处处长麦肯尼斯副教授在接受记者采访时说，当局还不知道2月15日出席晚宴的客人的确切人数。\n萨弗拉在周四的一份声明中说，这项活动是在其经营场所的欢乐花园餐厅举行的，该餐厅随后于2月16日至19日因清洁而关闭。报告还说，所有游客都要检查体温，并要求他们对最近的旅行记录进行申报。\n他们没有发烧，也没有任何流感样症状。萨弗拉说：“在过去14天内，他们也没有任何近期到中国大陆旅游的历史，正如他们在声明中所说的那样。”。\n麦教授补充说，目前正在进行调查，以评估有多少人参加了晚宴，哪些人可能与当局现在知道感染的个人有过密切接触。\n是什么样的事件？ \n卫生部传染病科主任弗农李副教授说，这次私人活动是由几个人为朋友和其他家庭成员组织的一次坐下晚餐和一次社交活动。\n麦教授说，人们坐在不止一张桌子旁，整个晚餐都在私人功能室里走动。\n为什么要花一段时间才能找到链接？\n麦副教授说，在萨弗拉朱隆的17个确诊病例中，并不是所有人都参加了私人晚. 一些与该组织有联系的感染者不在场，但他们是参加该活动者的家属。\n他说，花了“一段时间”才确定群里的感染者是如何联系在一起的。\n这是在广泛记录、调查感染者的活动和追踪接触者之后才发生的。然后，当局能够确定确诊病例的共同活动——即萨弗拉朱隆的私人职能。\n麦教授补充说，当局必须采访这些人，试图找出他们的动向，评估他们接触过谁，然后再采访其他人。\n“这需要时间。这也解释了为什么要花这么长时间来确定涉及的各种人员，同时也要对这些人员进行诊断，”他说，并补充说，目前正在继续进行接触者追踪和调查。\n麦教授警告说，未来几天可能会出现更多与该集群相关的案例。\n为什么有些病例现在才出现？\n麦副教授说，来自萨弗拉-句容集群的一些病例在“症状出现后几天”提交给当局。\n他补充说，一些感染者继续参加社交活动，尽管有呼吸道症状，但还是去上班了。\n“我们一直在告诉公众，如果你生病了，请不要混在一起，（不要）继续你的社交活动（或）工作活动。如果你生病了，早点去看医生，然后隔离。”\n他说，当人们有流感症状或生病时，如果不听从号召，不去参加聚会，就很难控制这种疾病，并“使其他本来可以很好地感染Covid-19的人暴露在外.\n“因此，这使得我们的任务更具挑战性，我们要确定谁可能是亲密接触者，然后将他们隔离，并对他们进行监视。”\n李副教授强调了同样的观点：“这都是一个集群，是某个有症状的人参加活动的结果。\n“所以，只要人们恪守这些社会责任，生病时不要到处走动，那么我们就可以看到，这整个事件不会发生。”\n当被问及在私人活动中对确定的与会者做了什么时，李副教授解释说，活动已经进行了14天多，所以只有那些报告身体不适的人必须去医院检查。\n他说：“那些全身健康的人不会被隔离，因为他们已经度过了14天的暴露期。”。\n还有谁和这个集群有联系？\n除了上周五新确认的9起病例外，此前报道的另外8起病例与萨弗拉朱隆的病例群有关。\n他们是：案例96，莱佛士学院一年级学生，与案例94有关，64岁的新加坡妇女，然后与案例112有关，案例112是创意幼儿园湾的助理厨师。这些病例最近都没有前往中国、韩国大邱市或昌都县。\n病例107为68岁新加坡妇女，2月11日至14日在印度尼西亚雅加达，病例117为52岁新加坡妇女，3月1日在马来西亚。\n与Safra-Jurong病例群相关的其他病例还有114、115和116例，这些病例在周四得到确认。\n萨夫拉朱隆采取了什么预防措施？ \n萨弗拉在其网站上周四的一份声明中说，那些参加过私人晚宴并随后检测出Covid-19阳性的个人已经通过了它进行的强制性温度检.\n它说，萨夫拉裕廊的所有访客和雇员都接受了针对Covid-19爆发的温度检查，并采取了其他措施，如加强对设施的清洁和消毒。\n声明还说，所有游客都必须对自己的旅行历史进行申报，并提供详细的联系方式。\n萨弗拉在周五早些时候在Facebook上发表的一篇文章中说，这家餐厅以及所有其他可能受到影响的个人参观过的地方，将“从3月6日起再次彻底清洗和消毒”。\n在Facebook的另一篇帖子中，Safra Jurong说餐厅将于3月6日至12日关闭",

Taiwan has called China \"vile\" for not allowing it real time information about the virus from the WHO. China says Taiwan gets the information it needs.  \n This week Taiwan's government reported an increase in fake online reports about the virus on the island, and blamed China's \"internet army\" for being behind the misinformation. China has not responded to the allegations.  \n Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said on Twitter that Chinese officials claim to care about the health of the Taiwanese \"as if we're blood relatives\".  \n He added: \"But while #Taiwan is dealing with #COVID19 originating from #Wuhan, their cyber warriors are waging war to disrupt our efforts. So this is epidemic fighting with Chinese characteristics. I'm speechless.\"  \n The fake reports, which Taiwan's government has quickly and strongly refuted, include claims that the island is covering up the true number of cases and that members of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party get priority for face masks.  \n Taiwan says it will punish people who spread the rumours. The island has long claimed China is intentionally using fake news to undermine its democracy and people's faith in the government. China has previously denied the accusations.  \n Adding to the tensions, China has in recent weeks been flying fighter jets and bombers close to the island. Taiwan's Defence Ministry reported another case on Friday.  \n While Taiwan moved early to suspend travel links with China to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and has reported far fewer cases than China, its number of patients has continued to grow.  \n On Saturday, Taiwan reported five new cases of infection, including four people who had contact with another infected patient in a hospital and one person returning from a trip to Egypt and Dubai, bringing Taiwan's total to 39.  \n Taiwan has reported one death from the coronavirus, while nine patients have recovered and been released from hospital.  \n China, where the outbreak began, has reported more than 79,000 infections and over 2,800 deaths.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Egypt, Algeria and South Africa are the African countries most at risk of coronavirus cases, although they are also the best prepared on the continent, according to a study published this Wednesday by the scientific journal \"The Lancet\".\nThe document also states that countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana and Kenya) are less prepared and therefore more vulnerable and need support to assist in the detection and treatment of cases imported from the new coronavirus (Covid-19).\n\"Increased resources, vigilance and empowerment must be urgently prioritized in African countries with moderate risk of importing new cases of the disease, as these countries are estimated to be ill-prepared to detect cases and limit transmission\", can be read in the note.\nThese positions are the result of a study published by The Lancet which assesses the readiness (i.e. the capacity of the health system) and the vulnerability (demographic, environmental, socio-economic and political conditions) of African countries, as well as the likelihood of importing cases of Covid-19 from China.\nNevertheless, the authors claim that these data should be interpreted in their context, because they estimate that the overall risk of importing cases from Covid-19 to Africa is lower than for Europe, but that the response and reaction capacity is more limited on the African continent.\nAlgeria, Ethiopia, South Africa and Nigeria were included in the 13th priority countries identified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the basis of direct links and travel volumes to China, although the first case of Covid-19 on the continent was confirmed in Egypt, the 14th of February. China is Africa's main trading partner, with high volumes of travel between the two territories.\nVarious measures have already been taken to prevent cases from being imported into several African countriesYeah. However, limiting and controlling post-importation transmission requires additional measures, such as enhanced surveillance, rapid identification of suspicious cases, patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracking and monitoring.\n\"Although almost three quarters of all African countries have a plan to prepare for an influenza pandemic, most are outdated and considered unsuitable for dealing with a global pandemic,\" stated the author of the study, Vittoria Colizza, the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and the Sorbonne University.\nThe researcher continued by saying that \"despite efforts to improve the WHO's diagnostic capability\", there are countries that \"do not have the resources to test the virus quickly\", meaning that the tests would need to be done in other countries.\nVittoria Colizza further noted that the consequences of recent epidemics and pandemics (Influenza H1N1 or Ebola) \"highlighted the need to strengthen national public health capacities and infrastructures\", because these factors are \"the first line of defense in the emergence of infectious diseases\" and called for the involvement of the international community.\nThe authors agree that the study has limitations, namely that they only used air travel data, and that the risk of import through other entries, such as sea ports, has not been evaluated.\nThe Covid-19 coronavirus caused dead 1.873 and infected around 73.400 people worldwide. Most of the cases occurred in China, where the epidemic was detected at the end of 2019 in Hubei Province, the most affected by the epidemic.\nIn addition to 1.868 killed in mainland China, there is a body registered in the Chinese region of Hong Kong, one in the Philippines, one in Japan, one in France and one in Taiwan. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), there are 45 confirmed cases in the European Union and the United Kingdom.

        "news_content_translate_en": "GENEVA/DUBAI - All countries need to prepare to combat the coronavirus, the World Health Organization said on Thursday (Feb 28), as authorities raced to contain the epidemic's rapid global spread and Wall Street looked set for its biggest weekly fall since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. \n With new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said even rich nations should prepare. \n \"No country should assume it won't get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,\" Dr Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe's worst outbreak. \n In addition to stockpiling medical supplies, governments ordered schools shut and cancelled big gatherings, including sports events, to try to halt spread of the flu-like disease known as COVID-19 that emerged in central China more than two months ago from an illegal wildlife market. \n The death rate appears to be around 2 percent, although it could be lower if there are many mild, undiagnosed cases, experts say. \n By comparison, seasonal influenza has a case fatality rate of around 0.1 per cent, said Anthony Fauci, Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, ahead of a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence, who has been put in charge of coordinating the U.S. response. \n \"So therefore you have somewhat of a serious potential for morbidity and mortality,\" he said, adding, \"We're dealing with a serious virus.\" \n There is particular concern over a case in Japan in which a woman tested positive for the virus for a second time. Second positive tests have also been reported in China and could imply contracting the disease does not confer immunity. Scientists warned that much remains unknown about this new virus. \n The head of the WHO's emergency program, Dr. Mike Ryan, said discussions were being held with organizers about the fate of the 2020 Olympics, scheduled for July in Tokyo, although no decision was expected soon. \n Their cancellation or relocation would be a massive blow for Japan, which said it was closing its entire school system for the next month in a bid to prevent spread of the virus. \n The virus has so far mainly battered China, causing nearly 80,000 infections and more than 2,700 deaths, according to WHO figures. It has spread to another 46 countries, where around 3,700 cases and 57 deaths have been reported. \n \"This virus has pandemic potential,\" Dr Tedros told reporters in Geneva. He said Iran, Italy and South Korea were at a \"decisive point,\" but still short of sustained community transmission. \n MARKET SELLOFF \n Spooked by the impact on China, the heart of corporate supply chains, and the increasing effect on other countries, stocks sank deeper into the red on Thursday and oil prices fell. \n Global equity markets have dropped for six straight days, wiping out more than US$3.6 trillion (S$5.02 trillion) in value. \n The S&P 500 finished 12per cent below its Feb. 19 record close, marking its fastest correction ever in just six trading days, while the Dow registered a record one-day points drop, which was also its fourth 1,000-point decline in history and the second this week. \n Dr Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, urged finance institutions to commit an initial US$10 billion funds to fighting the virus. \n \"What we are really missing is tangible, high-level funding and support from global financial institutions,\" he said in a statement. \"The possible impact of this coronavirus is far beyond a health emergency - it's a global crisis with potential to reach the scale of the global financial crisis of 2008.\" \n Traders are betting the US Federal Reserve will move aggressively to cut borrowing costs in coming months in response to the effects of the coronavirus on the economy. \n Politicians are also scrambling to respond. \n President Donald Trump's administration was considering invoking special powers to rapidly expand U.S. production of protective gear, two officials told Reuters. \n California's governor complained that the state was monitoring over 8,000 people but had only 200 test kits. \n President Emmanuel Macron attempted to rally the nation as France's number of reported cases doubled. \n \"We have a crisis before us. An epidemic is on its way,\" Macron said. \n Germany, too, has warned of an impending epidemic. And Greece, a gateway for refugees from the Middle East and beyond, announced tighter border controls. \n There is no cure for the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia, and a vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop. \n MISINFORMATION 'EPIDEMIC' \n Iran extended closures of cinemas, cultural events and conferences for another week and called off Friday prayers in some cities. \n The WHO's Ryan said Iran's outbreak may be worse than realized. It has suffered the highest death toll outside China, with 26 dead, suggesting there are likely many more cases than the 245 reported, which includes some senior officials. \n Italy, desperate to stave off a probable recession, warned that an \"epidemic of misleading information\" could do worse harm than the virus itself. \n The coronavirus has played havoc with global aviation and tourism as airlines cancel flights, countries ban visitors from hot spots and nervous passengers put off travel. \n Chinese authorities said the number of new deaths there stood at 29, its lowest daily tally since Jan. 28. There were 439 new cases in mainland China as of Thursday, the WHO said, compared to 746 elsewhere.  REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — The Government has not waived or reduced foreign worker levies to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak because it wants to focus on preserving jobs for Singaporeans and to encourage restructuring, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo told Parliament on Wednesday (Feb 26). \n Ms Teo spoke after two labour Members of Parliament (MPs) made speeches calling for foreign worker levy cuts, similar to those implemented during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak. \n The MPs are Mr Seah Kian Peng of Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and Nominated MP Arasu Duraisamy, who is a member of the National Trades Union Congress’ central committee. \n Nominated MP Douglas Foo, president of the Singapore Manufacturing Federation, said that business operators are hoping for the Government to “extend a further helping hand” by suspending or waiving levy collection for existing work permit holders during this uncertain period. \n Ms Teo, however, said that the Government’s priority in supporting businesses is to “preserve local employment”, adding that a levy waiver or a cut “will not benefit the many employers who only have local employees”. \n Waiving or cutting levies will also “blunt the motivation” among businesses to restructure, improve job quality and become leaner in manpower, she pointed out. “We would not have seen how industries can rise to the occasion.” \n Ms Teo cited the example of the hotel industry that has shown resolve and creativity in overcoming their manpower constraints. \n For instance, housekeepers at Copthorne King hotel on Havelock Road no longer waste time knocking on doors to figure out which room should be cleaned and are now notified through a mobile application, which is linked to an in-room control unit that also turns off electrical power when guests have left. \n And Andaz Hotel in the Beach Road area no longer has a team of confectioners in its kitchen and instead keeps its customers happy with supplies from Tiong Bahru Bakery and cleverly brands this as part of the heritage experience for guests, she pointed out. \n “As much as we want to help businesses, measures to deal with the short-term fallout should not negate longer-term efforts for companies to become less reliant on foreign manpower for growth,” Ms Teo said. \n “Levy waivers or reductions would run counter to both objectives.” \n The tourism, food-and-beverage and retail sectors, for example, have been hit hard by the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Ms Teo reminded the House of the Budget this year where 60 per cent of the S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package would go to the Jobs Support Scheme and enhanced Wage Credit Scheme, which would benefit firms with Singaporean staff members. \n On the upside, she noted that the Government has not raised levies this time round. They had stayed the same since 2017 for the construction sector, and since 2016 or earlier for other sectors. \n The levy rates for workers in the marine shipyard and process sectors were supposed to go up by between S$50 and S$150 in 2018 and 2019, but those increases were deferred. \n The levy rate for the basic tier of S-Pass holders is at S$330, while the levy rate for other S-Pass holders is S$650. Levy rates for work permit holders are between S$250 and S$950. \n While there is no change to these levy rates, Ms Teo said that the Government had acted to waive levies for employers whose foreign workers are required to serve quarantine, leave of absence or stay-home notices after they have recently travelled to China. \n ALTERNATIVES TO NO-PAY LEAVE AND LAYOFFS \n Ms Teo said that companies with excess employees should consider other options instead of getting their workers to go on no-pay leave or laying them off. \n She highlighted that the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment recommends redeploying the workers to other work areas, giving them shorter work weeks, implementing job-sharing, or introducing adjustments to certain wage components. \n “These options would at least maintain most, if not all, of the workers’ past incomes,” she said. \n For employers with excess foreign workers, the Singapore Business Federation will administer a temporary scheme to help transfer the workers to employers with manpower shortages, she said. \n This will help employers whose workers from China have not obtained approval to return to Singapore and employers who cannot hire new workers ho are Chinese nationals due to suspended approvals. \n Ms Teo said that companies are already proactively considering such sensible measures that do not just cut costs but save jobs and she is heartened by their efforts. \n Some are asking their workers to clear their annual leave or time off, and others are exploring shorter work weeks while getting their workers to for for training to for upskill themselves. \n The disease outbreak has sparked a “viral interest” among workers in using technology for alternative work arrangements, she said. \n Even mature workers who were struggling to pick up digital tools had found ways to work virtually “almost overnight”, she noted. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BAGHDAD (Iraq) — Iraqi and Kuwaiti authorities were on high alert Friday (Feb 21) after banning travel the previous day to and from Iran, where authorities say the death toll from the new coronavirus has hit four. \n Iran's health ministry Friday reported two more deaths among 13 new diagnosed cases of the COVID-19 virus, doubling the total number of deaths in the Islamic republic and taking the total number of diagnosed infections there to 18. \n Since December, the virus has killed more than 2,200 people in China, the epidemic's epicentre. \n Elsewhere in the world, it has killed over a dozen people and spread across some 26 countries. \n In the Middle East, two elderly men in Iran were the first confirmed deaths from the virus, which has also spread to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel, which confirmed its first case on Friday.  \n Both Iraq and Kuwait, which respectively share land and maritime borders with Iran, have not confirmed any cases of the virus internally. \n But the outbreak in the Islamic Republic has sparked alarm, especially since many of the coronavirus cases involved residents of the holy city of Qom, a popular destination for Kuwaiti and Iraqi Shiites.  \n Shiite leader Moqtada Sadr, a major figure in Iraqi politics, himself studies in an Islamic seminary in Qom.  \n Iraq is a popular destination for millions of Iranian Shiite pilgrims, including religious scholars from Qom, who visit holy sites in the southern provinces of Najaf and Karabala. \n Iran is also the second-largest exporter of goods to Iraq, sending products to the value of around nine billion dollars annually. \n SISTANI URGES PREPARATION \n Iraq's top Shiite cleric on Friday called on authorities to be ready to stem any outbreak. \n \"The scale of preparations should match that of the threat,\" said Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani in his weekly sermon delivered by a representative. \n \"We call on relevant authorities to be up to the level of responsibility\". \n A key player in Iraq, Iran supplies Baghdad with the energy it desperately needs to combat chronic power cuts and wields sizable influence over political and paramilitary factions in the country.  \n American threats of sanctions and tit-for-tat bombings between US and Iranian forces on Iraq's soil have done little to stem the movement of people and goods between Tehran and Baghdad.  \n The COVID-19 virus, however, has triggered unprecedented measures.  \n Iraq on Thursday clamped down on travel to and from the Islamic republic, with Iraq's health ministry announcing people in Iran were barred from entering the country \"until further notice\". \n \"Iranians are prohibited from entering (Iraq),\" a senior official told AFP, adding that border crossings with Iran had been closed, with only returning Iraqis allowed to pass through. \n Those Iraqis would be examined and, if necessary, placed in quarantine for 14 days, the health ministry said. \n Iraqi nationals are also not allowed to travel to Iran, according to the ministry. \n The border closure followed a backlash against a Wednesday announcement of visa waivers for Iranian nationals wishing to travel to Iraq. \n Iraqis took to social media using the hashtag \"close the border\" and local officials called for a ban on the entry of goods and people. \n Iraqi airports were already screening travellers for the virus and national carrier Iraqi Airways has suspended flights to Iran.  \n Iraq had previously issued a ban on the entry of Chinese nationals. \n In Kuwait, national carrier Kuwait Airways announced Thursday it would suspend all flights to Iran, while its ports will also be closed to passengers travelling to and from the country.  \n Kuwaitis were advised not to travel to Qom, and were warned anyone arriving from the city they would be quarantined. \n SOCIAL MEDIA STORM \n Social media networks have become fertile ground for fears among Iraqis who say the healthcare system —  battered by waves of conflict —  cannot accomodate a coronavirus outbreak. \n Hospitals are generally poorly equipped in terms of equipment and medicine, while some still require reconstruction and refurbishment. \n More than 20,000 doctors have left the country since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, according to health professionals.  \n There are less than 10 doctors for every 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.  \n Iraqis are circulating prayers on social media networks, while videos circulating online showed Iraqi and Iranian families lighting incense in their homes with the belief that it will prevent infection.  \n Some said they were turning to herbalists for natural remedies, while others joked that alcohol consumption could combat the virus.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON/BEIJING - HIV patients in China risk running out of life-saving AIDS drugs because quarantines and lockdowns aimed at containing the coronavirus disease outbreak mean they cannot replenish vital medicine stocks, United Nations AIDS agency said on Wednesday.  \n UNAIDS said it had surveyed more than 1,000 people with HIV in China and found that the outbreak of the coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, is having a \"major impact\" on their lives.  \n The outbreak so far infected more than 74,000 in China, and killed 2,004 of them. Outside China, five deaths and 827 cases have been reported so far.  \n Nearly a third of the HIV positive people surveyed by UNAIDS said lockdowns and restrictions on movement in China meant they were at risk of running out of their HIV treatment in the coming days.  \n Of these, almost half - or 48.6% - said they did not know where to collect their next antiretroviral therapy refill from.  \n \"People living with HIV must continue to get the HIV medicines they need to keep them alive,\" UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said in a statement. \"We must ensure that everyone who needs HIV treatment gets it, no matter where they are.\"  \n UNAIDS says that according to Chinese government sources there were an estimated 1.25 million people with HIV in China at the end of 2018.  \n One HIV-positive volunteer AIDS campaigner in China told Reuters he has set up a group chat that includes more than 100 HIV patients, mostly in Hubei province - epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak - where he is helping patients to share limited stocks of medicines between them.  \n Some HIV patients are scared of letting other people know why they are desperate to get out of the cities.  \n \"(Patients are) very panicked, very panicked, and in the group chat I have to comfort them constantly,\" said the campaigner, who did not want to give his name. \"For patients, medicine is important, treatment is important. This could be as important as front-line relief supplies.\"  \n Adding to the problem of potential shortages is an emerging practice of people not infeGcted with HIV appealing to patients with the AIDS-causing virus to share their medicine as potential experimental treatment against the new coronavirus.  \n Although there is no evidence from clinical trials, China’s National Health Commission said the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir could be tried in COVID-19 patients.  \n That triggered a rush for drugs such as Kaletra, also known as Aluvia, which is drugmaker AbbVie's off-patent version of lopinavir/ritonavir.  \n UNAIDS said lockdowns in various cities have also meant that people with HIV who had travelled away from their home towns have not been able to return home and access HIV services, including treatment, from their usual providers.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States and China on Monday (March 16) each demanded that the other stop smearing its reputation over the novel coronavirus as the pandemic became the latest row between the powers. \n The clash came on the day that the World Health Organisation said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China, where the new coronavirus virus was first detected late last year. \n US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels \"to shift blame for Covid-19 to the United States\", the State Department said. \n Mr Pompeo \"stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat\", the department added. \n The State Department last Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador, Mr Cui Tiankai, to denounce Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media. \n Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in tweets last week in both Mandarin and English, suggested that \"patient zero\" in the global pandemic may have come from the US - not the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. \n \"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,\" tweeted Mr Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media. \n Scientists suspect that the virus first came to humans at a meat market in Wuhan that butchered exotic animals. \n Mr Pompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to Sars-CoV-2 as the \"Wuhan virus\" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatising. \n Mr Yang issued a \"stern warning to the United States that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail,\" the official Xinhua news agency said in its summary of the call with Pompeo. \n The key Chinese foreign policy leader \"noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatised the country, which has enraged the Chinese people\", Xinhua said. \n \"He urged the US side to immediately correct its wrongful behaviour and stop making groundless accusations against China.\" \n US President Donald Trump, under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his allies have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners. \n Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a Trump ally, has spoken of the \"Chinese coronavirus\" and in a recent statement vowed, \"we will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\". \n While Covid-19 - the disease caused by the virus - has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries. \n The pandemic comes at a time of wide-ranging tensions between the US and China on issues from trade to human rights to Beijing's military buildup. \n ",

Separately, eastern Zhejiang province donated thousands of boxes of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in the European nation. \n In the phone call on Tuesday (March 10), Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the two nations' friendship would see new progress as they work to tackle the fast-spreading virus. \n Mr Di Maio briefed on Italy's latest development on the epidemic prevention and control work, and thanked China for its support for Italy. \n Pointing out the severe situation in Italy at present, Mr Di Maio said the Italian government is paying close attention to and learning from China's successful experience in the battle against the virus, taking strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease. \n Italy is facing a shortage of medical supplies and equipment, said Mr Di Maio, expressing hopes that China would help resolve their urgent need. \n Overseas Chinese living in Italy have played an active role in the fight against the epidemic, said Mr Di Maio, adding that Italy will continue to take full care of their health and safety. \n Mr Wang said that as a good friend and comprehensive strategic partner of Italy, China fully understands the challenges Italy is confronting. \n The epidemic knows no border and is a common enemy of mankind, Mr Wang noted as he called for solidarity from the international community to combat the virus. \n Upholding the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, China is dedicated not only to making all-out efforts to keep the Chinese people safe and sound, but also to making contributions to global public health security, Mr Wang said. \n China recently made donations to the World Health Organisation to support international cooperation on the Covid-19 fight. China is also offering help within its capacity to countries where the epidemic situation is severe or where medical conditions are poor, Mr Wang said. \n Noting that the Chinese people will not forget Italy's support when China was facing its toughest moment in the fight against the virus, Mr Wang said China is now willing to stand firmly by the side of the Italian people. \n Though China itself at present still needs a large amount of medical materials, the country, overcoming the difficulties, will offer Italy with assistance like medical materials including face masks, and accelerate and enhance the exports of supplies and equipment to meet Italy's urgent need, Mr Wang said. \n If the Italian side requires, Mr Wang said, China would like to send medical personnel to Italy to help combat the novel coronavirus. \n The Chinese cities and provinces that enjoy friendship relations with their Italian peers, as well as Chinese enterprises, will also offer support and aid to Italy, the minister added. \n Mr Wang said he believes the joint battle against the coronavirus will help deepen bilateral relations between the two countries, and enhance the friendship between the two peoples. \n China appreciates that the Italian side has paid high attention to the health and safety of the Chinese nationals in Italy, and hopes that Italy will continue to offer them necessary help and support, the minister said. \n Hand in hand, China and Italy will prevail over the epidemic eventually, Mr Wang added. \n On Wednesday, China's eastern Zhejiang province sent 3.86 million pieces, or 4,556 boxes, of protective gear to help overseas Chinese in Italy. \n A cargo plane loaded with 26.4 tonnes of disposable masks, N95 medical masks, goggles, latex gloves and other protective clothing left the provincial capital of Hangzhou for Europe at 5.50am, Xinhua reported.  \n Zhejiang’s first batch of donations for overseas Chinese came from people from all walks of life in the province. More than 300,000 Chinese people from Zhejiang live in Italy.  \n “Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus, overseas Chinese of Zhejiang origin have tried every means to purchase epidemic prevention materials and support their hometown to fight the epidemic,” said Mr Zhang Weiren, vice-chairman of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. “Overseas Chinese are now in difficulty, and their relatives in the motherland should give them the utmost support.\" \n Due to the suspension of direct flights between China and Italy, the donations would arrive first in Liege, Belgium, and then be transferred to Italy, said Mr Gao Kaiyong, deputy chief of the general office of the Zhejiang Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. \n “If all goes well, the goods will arrive in Turin, Italy, this weekend,” \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "TOKYO (AFP) - A state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping this spring has been postponed, as preventing the outbreak of the new coronavirus is “the biggest challenge” for the two countries, Japan’s top government spokesman said on Thursday (March 5). \n \"A state visit by President Xi to Japan will be held at a convenient time for both of us,\" chief Cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters in Tokyo. “The biggest challenge now for both countries is the prevention of the spread of the new coronavirus. It is necessary to give first priority to this.” \n Mr Xi had been expected to make the state visit in the spring after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe formally invited him during last year’s Group of 20 summit in Osaka. The last state visit by a Chinese president to Japan was in 2008, and Mr Xi’s trip was cast as a key sign of warming bilateral ties. \n The coronavirus outbreak, however, has delayed the visit. \n “China and Japan are both currently fully fighting the NCP (novel coronavirus pneumonia) epidemic,” Mr Zhao Lijian, foreign ministry spokesman, told a news conference in Beijing. “Both sides agreed on the necessity of ensuring that Chairman Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan takes place at the most appropriate timing, environment and atmosphere, and achieves full success.” \n Japanese officials had in recent weeks insisted that the trip was on despite the spread of the virus. \n “A visit to Japan by a Chinese president is once-in-a-decade event,” Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said last week. “It is important that we will make sure that it will be something that will result in full achievements,” he added, in comments seen at the time as suggesting the trip could be delayed. \n The virus has infected more than 95,000 people worldwide and killed over 3,200.  \n The postponement came as Japan steps up its response to the epidemic, which has infected at least 317 people and been linked to six deaths domestically. Tokyo has faced criticism for acting slowly when the outbreak began and for its handling of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where more than 700 people contracted the virus. \n On Thursday, the Yomiuri daily reported that Japan will quarantine all arrivals from China and South Korea for two weeks, without specifying when the measures were expected to take effect. In an exclusive, the paper said Chinese and Korean tourists would be asked not to visit Japan, and visas would be suspended. The Yomiuri said the measures would be announced by Mr Abe later on Thursday. \n Relations between Asia’s two biggest economies have warmed in recent years after suffering in 2012 when Tokyo “nationalised” disputed islands claimed by Beijing. \n Mr Abe visited Beijing in 2018 – the first official visit by a Japanese prime minister since 2011. He also visited China last December to hold talks with South Korea’s Mr Moon Jae-in and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at a trilateral summit. During his stay in China, Mr Abe separately met Mr Xi. \n Last June, Mr Abe met Mr Xi on the sidelines of the G-20 summit and invited him for a state visit. “I want to enhance Japan-China relations... by welcoming President Xi Jinping to Japan during cherry blossom next year,” Mr Abe said at the time. \n The world’s second- and third-largest economies have a fraught relationship, complicated by longstanding maritime disputes and Japan’s wartime legacy. The thaw has accelerated in recent months as both countries face trade battles with United States President Donald Trump. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - As more countries record new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus, Indonesia's claim of being virus-free continues to raise doubts as questions persist over the effectiveness of monitoring and testing efforts of local health authorities. \n The country only allows one lab, run by the Health Ministry's Health Research and Development Agency (Balitbangkes), to test swab samples of suspected Covid-19 patients. \n As of Saturday (Feb 29), it had tested 143 samples taken from people who had shown symptoms or had travelled to infected countries. All were reportedly negative. \n However, the government did not test the 237 citizens and one American spouse of an Indonesian national who were evacuated from Wuhan and other cities in China after a 14-day quarantine in Natuna, Riau Islands. \n The government claimed they had already been declared virus-free when leaving China, so it was unnecessary for them to be tested again. \n Instead of being more vigorous and deploying more resources in conducting health monitoring and tests, the government later announced it would allocate Rp 72 billion (S$7.2 million) for promotional purposes - partly for so-called social media influencers - to attract foreign tourists to Indonesia and help revive the country's tourism, which has been battered by the outbreak. \n But this kind of blind optimism wins nobody's trust, especially from the international community. \n Several foreign nationals who transited in Indonesia have tested positive for Covid-19. They might have contracted the virus in Indonesia and it does not rule out the possibility that the country has become a vector of the disease. \n Saudi Arabia has banned Indonesian pilgrims from going on umrah (minor haj), even though Indonesia has not declared any confirmed cases of infection. \n A document circulating among foreign diplomats obtained by the Sydney Morning Herald pointed out that the inadequate transportation of specimens was among the concerns that led them to doubt Indonesia's virus-free status. \n Countries have escalated measures to mitigate the virus. The New York Times reported that measures would be expanded throughout the United States, which has tested 500 patients, following a flaw found in the tests that were only performed by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. \n One person has reportedly died of the virus in the US. \n Malaysia has tested 1,092 cases as of Feb 24, while South Korea has tested over 60,000 people as of Thursday (Feb 27). \n There is no reason for Indonesia to do less or overstate its coronavirus status.

Wuhan is the perfect weapon. It only affects human beings. No other living thing can be a carrier.\"\nViral also became an image of the \"Asterix in Italy\" comic, published in 2017, where a driver named Coronavirus takes part in a chariot race, although it has nothing to do with any disease, being only a curiosity of name and country.\nIn these days of searching for catastrophic omens, also a warning from Bill Gates, made in February of 2017, was put into circulation. At the time, Microsoft's co-founder said that a pathogen that is airborne and rapidly moving \"could kill more than half a million people in less than a year\", although earlier in 2015 he had warned during a lecture that the world was not prepared \"for a next epidemic\".\nThe most catastrophic is the description written by Sylvia Browne in her 2008 book \"End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World\", which also spread through social networks, according to which a respiratory disease would erupt throughout the planet in the year 2020, and would not disappear until ten years had passed.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak, detected in December in China, which can cause respiratory infections such as pneumonia, caused about three.300 deaths and infected more than 95 thousand people in 79 countries, including eight in Portugal.\nFrom infected people, more than fifty thousand have recovered.\nIn addition to three.012 killed in China, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Thailand, the United States of America and the Philippines, San Marino, Iraq, Switzerland and Spain.\nA Portuguese crewman of a cruise ship is hospitalized in Japan for confirmation of infection.\nIn Portugal, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed eight cases of infection, of which six in Porto, one in Coimbra and one in LisbonYeah.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak an international public health emergency and increased the risk to \"very high\".",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "由一种新型冠状病毒引起的Covid-19的流行，引发了阿尔伯特·加缪小说《瘟疫》的网上销售，以及约瑟夫·萨拉马戈在受影响最大的欧洲国家意大利的“失明测试”。\n在人们担心中国12月发现新的冠状病毒的时候，为了避免传播，各种文化活动和设备已经被取消，但另一方面，从年初开始，人们对涉及流行病主题的书籍、电影、系列或游戏的搜索一直在增加。\n最新的指标显示，《瘟疫》（1947）等书的销量有所增加，该书由诺贝尔文学奖得主、法裔阿尔及利亚作家阿尔伯特·加缪（Albert Camus）撰写，加缪今年是他的逝世60周年纪念日，他正在谈论1940年代的瘟疫，瘟疫迅速席卷了阿尔及利亚的整个奥伦市。\n由于受到隔离，这个城市变成了一个肆无忌惮的领土，它的居民被带进了痛苦、疯狂和同情的状态。\n上个月，在意大利这个受感染最严重的欧洲国家，有3089例确诊感染病例，超过5万人因Covid-19病毒爆发而被隔离。\n在这个国家，加缪的书在门户网站ibs的销量排行榜上上升到第三位，一个月前，加缪的书排在第71位，它提前报道了意大利报纸《共和国报》，亚马逊平台的经典类图书排名也有所上升，销量翻了两番。\n在法国，类似的情况也发生了，根据Edistat图书销售统计门户网站的数据，《瘟疫》的销量在今年前两个月达到了889册，去年全年的总销量为22400册是 啊。\n同样，三年后获得诺贝尔文学奖的作家约瑟夫·萨拉马戈（Joseph Saramago）的《失明测试》（1995）也成为意大利的一种文学现象，在ibs排行榜上排名前十，亚马逊排名第五，销量增长了180%。\n这个故事讲述了一种白盲的流行，一开始是一个男人在车里堵车时莫名其妙地失明，然后像火药引信一样扩散，直到集体失明。\n像史蒂文·索德伯格（Steven Soderbergh）的《传染病》（2011）这样的电影也出现了类似于寻找这些书籍的情况，在这部电影中，一名从香港出差回来的妇女死于一种假定的流感，但病毒传播，致命的流行病蔓延，医生们已经没有时间去识别病毒并与之抗争，从而阻止民众的恐慌。\n根据谷歌趋势（Google Trends）的数据，《传染病》已经跻身iTunes十部最受关注的电影和下载量最高的十五部电影之列。\nNetflix的纪录片《Pandemia》也成为Twitter上的一个中心议题，该片讲述了抗击流感的英雄们以及他们为防止全球范围内的流感爆发所做的工作，而这并不是由冠状病毒引起的，但显示出世界卫生系统还没有准备好面对全球卫生危机。\n随着恐惧的蔓延，各种各样的预测已经出现在社交媒体上，其中一个在美国科幻作家迪恩·孔茨的小说《黑暗之眼》中有报道。\n1981年出版，1989年再版，书中有一章是关于一种叫做武汉-400的疾病的，它实际上是一种在中国城市制造的生物武器。\n描述这种病毒本身的后果的网页变成了病毒，特别是在Twitter上：“他们称之为武汉-400，因为它是在武汉市外的一个RDNA研究实验室中创建的，是n株在这个中心创造了400个人工微生物。武汉是完美的武器。它只影响人类。任何其他生物都不能成为载体。”\n病毒也成为2017年出版的“意大利阿斯特里克斯”漫画的一个形象，一个名叫冠状病毒的司机参加了一场战车比赛，尽管这与任何疾病无关，只是对名字和国家的好奇。\n在这些寻找灾难性征兆的日子里，比尔盖茨于2017年2月发出的警告也开始流传。当时，微软的联合创始人说，一种通过空气传播并迅速传播的病原体“可能在不到一年的时间内杀死50多万人”，尽管在2015年早些时候，他在一次演讲中警告说，世界并没有为“下一次流行病”做好准备。\n最具灾难性的是西尔维娅·布朗在其2008年出版的《末日：世界末日的预言和预言》一书中所作的描述，这本书也通过社交网络传播开来，根据这本书，一种呼吸道疾病将在2020年在地球上爆发，直到十年过去才会消失。\n去年12月在中国发现的可导致肺炎等呼吸道感染的Covid-19疫情，在79个国家造成约3300人死亡，9.5万多人感染，其中包括葡萄牙的8人。\n从感染者那里，已经有五万多人康复了。\n除了3.012人在中国丧生外，还有伊朗、意大利、韩国、日本、法国、香港、台湾、澳大利亚、泰国、美利坚合众国和菲律宾、圣马力诺、伊拉克、瑞士和西班牙的死亡报告。\n一艘游轮上的葡萄牙船员在日本住院确认感染。\n在葡萄牙，卫生总局确认了8例感染病例，其中6例在波尔图，1例在科英布拉，1例在里斯本是 啊。\n世界卫生组织（WHO）宣布Covid-19爆发为国际公共卫生紧急事件，并将风险增加到“非常高”。",
