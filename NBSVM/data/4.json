In total, there have been 28 suspected cases aged one to 78 years, said MOH. Seven people have been ruled out. \n \"All measures will be taken to contain its possible spread,\" said the ministry's director of communicable diseases Vernon Lee. \n But more cases are expected, given the large number infected in China and high travel volume from the country to Singapore. \n As for the first case here, the man was in isolation and was no longer a risk to the public, Associate Professor Lee stressed. \"There is no need for the general public to panic or take any special measures.\" \n Close contacts of confirmed cases will be quarantined\n. \n Yesterday, in measures to shore up defences against the virus, the newly formed multi-ministry task force decided at its first meeting to enhance border control and intensify screening. Measures have also been stepped up in places such as hospitals, schools and army camps. \n Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who heads the task force with National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, said that the effort was multi-tiered. \n \"First, we have to ensure that we do what we can in our defensive measures in terms of our border controls, temperature screening and so on, but at the same time, we have multi-layers of defence, including our clinics, hospitals, health institutions and healthcare workers who are at the front line.\" \n Finally, he said, it was important that everyone protected themselves by observing personal hygiene and behaving in a socially responsible way. \n Speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore had been preparing for a new viral outbreak since severe acute respiratory syndrome hit in 2003. \n This included doing a thorough review of infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and scientific testing and capabilities. \"And I think we are much better prepared now,\" he said. \n China, too, had made progress in dealing with public health emergencies, he noted. \n The country has taken the unprecedented move of putting extensive travel restrictions on cities at the heart of the outbreak, which has killed at least 17 and infected more than 600 people, with cases surfacing all over the world. \n Singaporeans are advised to avoid travel to the whole of Hubei province, in view of the travel restrictions China has imposed on Huanggang, Chibi, Xiantao and Ezhou, in addition to Wuhan, and to be cautious and pay attention to hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n The virus, now known as 2019-nCoV, is mutating and can now be passed from person to person\n. Infections are expected to spike over the Chinese New Year weekend, with hundreds of millions of travellers on the move. \n • Additional reporting by Timothy Goh and Aw Cheng Wei\n",

After announcing the suspension of mass transportation and Airport Flights in Wuhan at 10 a.m. in the early morning of the 23rd, a large number of vehicles caused highway congestion and supermarket shelves were also emptied due to panic.\nAfter the closure of Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou and Chibi announced the suspension of public transport in and outside the city, and Xiantao and Zhijiang also announced the suspension of passenger transport, the Central News Agency reported. In total, there are six cities in Hubei Province. In order to prevent the epidemic of mobile diffusion during the Spring Festival, the public transport service plan was suspended, and the citizens were advised not to go out of the city, and outsiders were not allowed to enter the city. The population affected reached 20 million, which is the largest closure plan in modern times.\nFrench tourists returning to Paris from Wuhan, China, on Thursday on a multiplication flight described the \"closure\" of Wuhan, AFP reported. Philippe dauger, a French tourist wearing a mask, told AFP that he was shocked by the lax security checks at Charles de Gaulle Airport after arriving in Paris. He described that when they got on the plane, the army had arrived. It was this morning that I learned that Wuhan was closed. \"All our French colleagues and friends stay there.\" \"The price of goods in the store has doubled, and there is a shortage of goods,\" he said. People are asking for information. \"\nIt was also reported that the National Health Protection Committee said that some new cases of coronavirus infection had not been to the Southern China seafood market in Wuhan, but did not travel to Wuhan.\nYang Gonghuan, former deputy director of the National Center for Disease Control and prevention, who participated in SARS epidemic prevention in 2003, believes that this means that a second generation of cases has emerged. The number of cases is still increasing, and she expects next month to be the peak of the outbreak. Yang Gonghuan added that although the ability of virus isolation in China is high and the detection facilities are advanced, the core problem is that in the face of infectious diseases, we can't hide it, we need to tell the people, let everyone understand, so as to better prevent and control.\n",

The outbreak is being followed closely and with apprehension, but the number of cases outside China is considered low. On the contrary, it increases the list of countries taking preventive measures and preparing for the possible need to deal with the disease.\nFrom China, country of origin of 2019-nCoV, news comes from more confined cities. After the quarantine imposed since Thursday on Wuhan, the focus of the infection, authorities ordered the isolation of four other nearby locations, extreme measure to try to control the transmission of the virus. On the list of cities closed to the outside are now Huanggang, with 7,5 million inhabitants, and three other smaller towns: Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang. The decision means that 21 million inhabitants are currently isolated.\nAt the end of this Thursday afternoon, the most recent data set the numbers at 18 deaths (mainly men) and 634 infected. New cases are expected, but it is difficult to anticipate at what rate and quantity.\nThe 18th death brought a novelty, since it was notified in China, but by the authorities of the province of Hebei, that is, outside Wuhan. Beyond the Chinese borders, the virus reached Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore and the United States, with echoes from Scotland about the possibility of four infected people, and in Canada several others being under medical surveillance, for showing signs of the disease.\nThis Thursday was also the day the European Centre for Disease Control raised the risk of coronavirus infection in the European Union (EU) to'moderate'.\nYeah. This represents a \"small increase\" in relation to the risk assessment made by the same body last week, and, as explained, comes in the follow-up to \"confirmation of transmission from human to human\".\nWith two patients placed in isolation and considered high-risk cases, Macao decided to cancel the Lunar New Year celebrations, while Hong Kong transformed two holiday camps into quarantine zones, aimed at people who had made contact with carriers of the new coronavirus.\nThe flow of Chinese tourists taking vacations on Lunar New Year is an increased concern, which has led several airports around the world to take specific precautions.\nOn another level, experts are looking for a better understanding of the virus they're dealing with. A first study published this Tuesday in the Science China Life Sciences magazine of the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed the relationship between the new coronavirus and the like.

        "news_content_translate_en": "There are almost two dozen confirmed fatalities of the new coronavirus detected in December in China. The number of infected is estimated to be over four thousand and the international community is taking steps to prevent the epidemic from becoming a pandemic.\nPortugal already has three preventive hospitals, two in Lisbon (Curry Cabral and Stephania) and one in Porto (St John). It will be in these units, in principle, that any persons in which the virus is detected will be admitted. A relatively remote hypothesis, but not inconceivable.\nThe original outbreak started in a shellfish and animal market in Wuhan, a Chinese town of 11 million inhabitants. The animal that gave rise to it is not yet known, although initial investigations seem to point to snakes and bats. The Express spoke to Celso Cunha, director of the medical microbiology unit at the Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine at the New University of Lisbon, to better understand the extent of the problem.\nWhat is the real risk now in Portugal? The real risk to the countries of Europe at the moment is considered low. Also in Portugal. There are some European airports that have direct flights to Wuhan, the region where the virus was detected. Heathrow, Charles de Gaulle, Rome, Istanbul, and Moscow too, unless I make a mistake. There appears to have been no cases in Europe from people who have travelled to that region. However, it is necessary, in my opinion, to keep an eye on travel not only to China but also to other countries where confirmed cases have also been detected: Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Macao, in particular.\nWhen a traveler arrives from Wuhan, what happens at the five airports you mentioned? Is the person tested? Not right now, as far as I know.\nYeah. In the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom measures are being considered at airports, some sort of screening of travellers coming from these areas, but I still do not know exactly what will be implemented. I know that the measures are being taken seriously, especially as a case has already been detected in the United States.\nWhat kind of measures are we talking about, and how would people be selected? Is it someone who had those symptoms that have been described as fever or difficulty breathing? Someone who travels on the plane with those symptoms and manifests them on arrival. When the SARS epidemic occurred, where there was also a coronavirus in China that initially caused an outbreak, which became an epidemic and then a pandemic, there were about nine thousand cases and about eight hundred, nine hundred deaths, almost ten per cent of mortality. At that time, measures were implemented that experienced triage of people with symptoms of some fever and a malaise compatible with a coronavirus diagnosis.\nIt is clear that most people who come with these symptoms are probably not infected with any coronavirus, but with another virus or bacterium that also causes these symptoms, similar to those of the flu virus. Depending on their severity, prior screening may or may not be advisable. And if the person is infected, refer them to health services.\nIs that from the airport? At the airport, it's not easy to diagnose. We may eventually have specialized personnel who can detect a suspicion. But not the diagnosis.\nHow is the diagnosis done? It can be done by harvesting nasal discharge. From there, the genome of the virus can be extracted. In this case, a genome composed of an RNA molecule, not DNA. It is a slightly different nucleic acid than DNA that is part of the genetic heritage of our cells.\nYeah. Although we also have lots of RNA in our system, but with other functions.\nThe genetic information of these viruses is contained in this RNA molecule, which is slightly different from DNA. What you do in the diagnosis is amplify this RNA by a reaction similar to what you do to amplify DNA, to detect it. Since Chinese scientists have already published the complete sequence of this coronavirus, it was possible to develop a test based on this PCR sequence, or polymerase chain reaction. With specific reagents, we can amplify only what interests us; in this case, the genome of the virus. If we can amplify it, we have a positive result.\nThis test can't be done at the airport. It has to be done in a lab. It doesn't take long, no more than four, five hours.\nIs the test already available all over the world? Yes,ma'am. Not commercially, but there are already guidelines from the European Center for Disease Control and the American CDC that indicate the protocol to be used.\nTherefore, in Portugal there are already ways, if a suspicious case arises, to make this test. -Absolutely. Any medium-sized diagnostic laboratory equipped shall be able to carry out the test.\nThose two viruses that were talked about a long time ago, SARS and MERS, had no cases detected in Portugal as far as I know, there were no such cases in Portugal. I could be wrong.\nThat it was reported, there wasn't. And a lot of people have a certain idea that these far-off diseases don't get here, they get here. Just like ours come to other places. People travel... Remember the Asian flu, last century. In two years, it spread from Asia around the world and killed tens of millions of people. There was also Spanish flu in 1918. At a time when there were no modes of transport today, a hundred million people have died all over the world in two years.\nYeah.\nSpeaking of SARS and MERS, why were there no cases in Portugal? Was it a question of luck or statistics? It is probably because very rapid preventive measures have been taken that have not been taken in other cases. By contrast, 1918 didn't even know it was a virus. Public health measures will not have been the most appropriate.\nThe new virus, as far as anyone knows, is less serious than the other two we talked about. So far, yes. We have 17 dead and five hundred and such cases confirmed. After all, it's four percent mortality. High rate for a respiratory infection. I know that the dead have been mainly older people, the older with 89, the younger with 48, and with other complications, such as diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson's, liver cirrhosis, other associated pathologies. These people were most vulnerable, and they were the first victims. Healthy people, young people, are more likely to survive and this will pass with mild symptoms, as if it were a common cold.\n",

Such symptoms are common in the middle of winter flu season, but the patient was being screened further on the basis of their travel history. \n A blood sample has been sent to the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, which should arrive late Thursday or early Friday, with a result expected within 24 hours after that. \n If the case is confirmed, the patient would be the second person to be infected with the pathogen on US soil after a man in his 30s near Seattle reported himself to authorities on Jan 19. \n That man, a US resident who also recently travelled to Wuhan, is said to be recovering well and is due to be released from hospital soon. \n CDC officials had already warned that there would be more cases in the US given the frequency of international travel. \n All air traffic from Wuhan is currently being funnelled through five airports where health officials have been deployed to carry out screening with questionnaires and temperature checks. \n The new respiratory virus has claimed 18 lives since emerging from a seafood and animal market in Wuhan and infected hundreds more. \n China has locked down some 20 million people at the epicenter of the outbreak, but the World Health Organisation said on Thursday the disease did not yet constitute a global health emergency. \n But it has generated alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. \n Follow us on Telegram for the latest updates: https://cna.asia/telegram \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Eight more people have fallen victim to the new lung disease in China. Overall, therefore, 26 deaths due to infections with the Coronavirus have been identified, as reported by authorities in China.\nCompared to the previous day, the number of known infections of 644 has increased to 830 cases. On Thursday, on the eve of the Chinese New Year's Eve, China had placed nearly twenty million people under quarantine in the fight against the disease. Authorities are calling off the 11-million-city of Wuhan, where most cases have occurred. The total number of cities affected by severe restrictions, including Wuhan, rose to at least eight by Friday. For example, Lichuan, Xianning and Huangshi also announced to stop bus lines and other local traffic. All the cities concerned are located in the province of Hubei.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) saw no reason on Thursday evening to call for an international emergency. \"This is not the right time,\" said the chairman of the emergency committee, Didier Houssin. He pointed out that there have so far been few cases abroad and that China has already taken far-reaching measures of its own.\nWHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said China had taken the measures it considered appropriate. \"We hope they are effective and short-lived,\" he said. The WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions. The Foreign Office in Berlin, however, advised to postpone unnecessary travel to the affected areas. The risk to German travellers in Wuhan is considered to be \"moderate\".\nThe WHO takes the outbreak extremely seriously, said WHO chief Tedros. \"It is not yet an international emergency, but it can still be,\" he said.\nYeah.\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn called for a prudent approach to the new lung disease that has broken out in China. \"We take this very seriously, we are vigilant, but also with a cool head at the same time,\" said the CDU politician on Thursday evening in the ARD \"Daily Topics\". You have a daily exchange with experts. \"I also think it is important that we sort this out in such a way that we can then also take the necessary rest.\"\nSpain praised the information policy of the Chinese government. Unlike the major Sars epidemic, which killed hundreds of people in China seventeen years ago, the international community's exchange works and China is also more transparent than it was a few years ago. It is therefore better to prepare for this. Spahn said it was important to classify the disease and pointed out the flu that killed around 20000 people every year in Germany. \"This is also a risk that we have every day.\" In the new lung disease, the incidence of infection is milder compared to this.\nAccording to Chinese authorities on Friday, another patient died outside the particularly affected province of Hubei, including the city of Wuhan, and the death was reported in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang. The day before yesterday, a death had already become known in the northern province of Hebei.\nMost of the victims were elderly people with pre-existing illnesses. Infections are now known in most Chinese provinces. In some cases the virus has also been detected in patients in other countries such as Thailand and the USA.\nHealth authorities in South Korea reported for the second time on Friday an infection with the new lung disease that broke out in neighbouring China. Concerned with a 55-year-old South Korean, the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Friday\nYeah.\nThe man then returned on Wednesday from a work stay in Wuhan, where the origin of the outbreak is suspected. On Thursday the first proven case was announced in Singapore. Japan reported a second case six months before the Olympic Games began in Tokyo. The man in his 40s is from Wuhan, the Ministry of Health reported on Friday. The man was visiting Japan. He's being treated at a hospital in Tokyo, they said.\nSo far, no case is known in Europe. According to German infectious specialists, isolated cases of the new lung disease are \"probable\" here as well. However, there was no cause for concern, the German Society for Infectiology reported. Clinics are currently preparing to respond quickly to these cases. (dpa)\n",

Two weeks of isolation will only be preventive, since they have no symptoms, as noted by Bethlehem Padilla, assistant doctor of the Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the Gregorio Maranon hospital and vice president of the Medical Association of Madrid: \"There are sick. They are people who have been in an area with coronavirus, but have no symptoms. Quarantine is to monitor only \".\nAlso emphasizes that the Health Minister Enrique Ruiz Escudero: \"There are considered and patients. They were in the region and are therefore potential candidates, but nothing more. Are asymptomatic and, if they had any symptoms, had been unable to travel. \"He explains to the phone when they arrive in Madrid will be another test and then go to\" normal to pass that preventive quarantine hospital. \"\nWhile the trip was being prepared, a few hours ago, the Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the international emergency outbreak to launch a \"global action\" to contain the advance of the virus and, community, the Ministry of Health established a protocol sent to all hospitals in the region to handle, if any, to patients suspected of infection with this virus. The alarm landing the plane can generate citizenship is normal -for the novelty of the virus- but lacking arguments. Dr. Padilla explains why.\nIs there a risk of contagion in Madrid?\nThe risk is now none, because there is no case in Spain. Although it seems a very transmissible virus [it has had a rapid spread], can only happen if you have traveled to that particular area of ​​China or had contact with people who have done it. But today the risk is zero.\nIs it advisable to take precautions?\nCurrently we do not have to do anything other than be aware of new information that gives the Ministry of Health and follow their recommendations as well as those published by the Community of Madrid. No need to go to pharmacies for masks or we use alcohol hand sanitizer for all and everywhere. We must take the same precautions apply with influenza or other viruses that visit us every year, for example, never coughing into hands, but in a handkerchief and then discarded or elbow.\nHow Madrid is ready to meet the arrival of evacuated citizens?\nTranquility has to be high, public health in Spain and Madrid is excellent, with excellent services microbiology and large hospitals that offer services where you can do the test for the virus if necessary, though, for now who has officially confirmed any suspicions is the National Microbiology Center (CNM) in Majadahonda.\nWhat if a case appeared in the Community?\nAlso tranquility would have to be absolute. We have two hospitals with isolation units, La Paz-Carlos III and Gómez Ulla military hospital, where patients could be. So far this untreatable virus, nor have many other viruses, and what they need are good supportive care. Oxygen in case of pneumonia, for example, or good intensive care services. Hospitals are putting up multidisciplinary teams to adopt the measures of the protocol of the Community of Madrid, formed by emergency physicians, preventive, microbiology, infectious and medical UVI.\nThe protocol to which Dr. Padilla refers establishes guidelines for handling possible cases when symptoms give the Ministry of Health has collected into a document. \"The most common include cough, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, a major difficulty breathing, kidney failure and even death. The most serious cases usually occur in elderly or suffering from some other disease such as of the heart, lung or immune problems. \" Although not yet known precisely how the infection occurs, the most accepted form is through contact and by droplets expelled to coughing.\nThe document states that \"in the first contact with patients who come to hospital emergency\" is necessary to ask if you have traveled to the province of Hubei in China, in the 14 days before the onset of symptoms or has been in contact with a probable or confirmed case of 2019-nCoV. If affirmative answer was, start the first part of the protocol, which involves the placement of surgical mask for both patient and staff to accompany him and isolation in a single habituation to the corresponding tests.\nIf the suspicion is confirmed, it would be reported immediately to Public Health and the necessary samples be extracted to send to the National Center for Microbiology (which should communicate the results in less than 24 hours), while the patient would have to remain in isolation to get the results.\nAnd \"if the clinical condition of the patient has severity criteria before knowing the diagnosis pending the result of the laboratory of the CNM, prior authorization for public health, may be transferred the patient to the referral hospital: Hospital La Paz-Carlos III\" says the document of the Ministry. In that case, \"Public Health who will perform communication to the Hospital La Paz-Carlos III and contact Summa 112 to transport the patient.\"\nThe Minister of Health believes it is essential to give information and give it responsibly: \"We must be expectantly, yes, but calm. And raise awareness of what is reality. Now, today, the population is not at risk \". If you ever happen, the region, claims the director, \"is absolutely ready\". Explains that this Thursday was updated with the latest information and with the Ministry of Health, the protocol for primary and hospital care and the management of patients suspected: \"Both epidemiological part as healthcare, is all scheduled and defined. Itineraries, processes patients, staff ... \".\nAs more becomes known to the experts whose mortality virus priced between 2% and 3%, compared with similar low virus, according to the data hitherto available-protocol will change if necessary. Guarding that information there, in Madrid, a specific committee as the Minister has already met three times and comprises the whole spectrum of specialists required by the situation, \"in perfect coordination\" with the Ministry. \"In any case, if a case occurs, Madrid has the care dimension list for what may come.

It is two Chinese tourists who arrived already infected with the transalpine country \"few days ago\" and are admitted to isolation from the afternoon of Wednesday in the Roman Spallanzani hospital specializing in infectious diseases. The director of the center, Giuseppe Ippolito, explained that patients are in good condition and arrived in Rome after being infected with the virus elsewhere. He also noted that at present there are no risks for the population. In a press conference tonight, Conte has also announced that Italy also shut down air traffic with China as a preventive measure. It is the first European country to take this decision.\nWednesday afternoon, a special ambulance picked up the two tourists who had symptoms compatible with the coronavirus in your accommodation, centrally located hotel with 200 rooms, and took them to the hospital in order to conduct the relevant tests. When the results were known, also they moved on a bus to a group of tourists from China, which had arrived in Italy with the tour operator himself the infected partner, but had no symptoms of the disease. The Prime Minister also announced that additional measures were studying people who had been in contact with patients. Conte also announced an extraordinary Council of Ministers for Friday, he said the situation is \"under control\" and sent a message of calm. \"The Spallanzani is the bible of this sector [the infectious diseases] and there is no reason to create panic and social unrest,\" he said.\nHealth Minister, Roberto Speranza said that health managers try to trace the route that have been done in Italy infected tourists. \"The occurrence of coronavirus in Italy is a fairly normal occurrence if we think of statistics as there are already ten cases in Europe. Our scientists have been saying for some time. The situation is serious, but do not fall into alarmism, \"he added.\nThursday was a tense day in Italy. Throughout the day, 6,000 passengers have been blocked on board a cruise in the Roman port of Civitavecchia in which there was a couple who had symptoms compatible with the coronavirus. A team of doctors moved to the ship from Rome for analysis to the two sick passengers. Late in the afternoon the health authorities confirmed the negative results of the analyzes, they said that it was \"a simple flu\" and gave the green light to the landing of the passage.\nTonight the World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to declare the international emergency outbreak of this new disease. The decision comes 30 days after the first alert for new launched disease by China on 31 December and after the number of people affected by the pathogen has been multiplied by 13 in the last week to over 9,000 confirmed cases and reach 213 dead. Of these, more than 80 patients have been diagnosed in 19 countries outside China. Finland, India, Italy itself and the Philippines have been the last to join the list.",

Globally, the number of deaths is still well below other viruses such as seasonal flu. However, seeing that the transmission of the virus went beyond China's borders, the World Health Organization (WHO) finally declaring a global health emergency last Thursday.\nMeanwhile, scientists are trying to understand how this virus against the clock works, how to infect our cells and how it is transmitted between humans. Over the past 20 days, more than 50 reports have been published on the coronavirus, according to the journal Nature. Of these, more than half are in repositories \"pre-print\", ie servers that allow sharing scientific articles in open while are reviewed for publication in academic journals.\nIn an unprecedented agreement, more than 70 organizations (including large publishers such as Nature, Cell and The Lancet and institutions like the British Academy Medical Sciences or the National Institutes of Health US) have pledged to make public all his works, without waiting to be reviewed for formal publication. So, not only they are sharing all discoveries about the coronavirus with WHO, but are also available for anyone to read from anywhere in the world.\nBioRxiv is a repository that these days is publishing numerous studies on the nature of the coronavirus (20 last week), while his counterpart MedRxiv addresses aspects related to health (and has published 14 reports on this virus in the same period ).\nIn addition, scientists are putting the genetic sequences of the coronavirus available to the international community in real time. This collaborative momentum that has already been key years with the outbreak of SARS or swine flu early, it is also crucial today to assess the situation and guide policy actions. To date, the coronavirus is less lethal than SARS, for example. However, a certain mutation in their genome could dramatically increase its virulence.\nIn emergency situations is a priority to inform politicians and health quickly. The publication of an article in academic journals is a demanding process that involves months or years of work, delaying the arrival of the findings of a research group to the rest of the community. Now, the possibility of sharing before its formal publication allows reacting to epidemics in a coordinated manner and as they develop. \"Quick access to information is essential to contrast everything that is happening globally,\" says Ester Lazarus, who investigates evolution of virus at the Center for Astrobiology. That publications are freely accessible also it allows the scientific community to evaluate the work, whether or not subscribed to the magazine turn. \"These repositories eliminate access barriers while reducing delays, so they are a great way to accelerate scientific breakthrough,\" says Thomas Faust, scientific publishing Hindawi.\nThe Achilles heel of the \"pre-print\" repositories is its reliability, because the work has not previously been examined by other scientists, unlike those published in magazines. From BioRxiv and MedRxiv remember, with a note on each item, which is preliminary reports pending review. \"These repositories are an extremely valuable resource, but should be used with caution and responsibility,\" warns Faust. \"Readers should be aware that these studies have not checked with the rigor of the usual peer review in academic journals,\" he adds.\nThe BioRxiv himself published a study on the similarity of the coronavirus with the AIDS virus containing serious technical failures. However, scientists quickly detect these errors and the item is removed from the server and shows that the \"pre-print\" repositories are subject to the intense scrutiny of the scientific community. \"Immediate access to what they are doing other researchers and to discuss your articles in a fluid way I think the biggest advantage [of these repositories]\" argues Lazarus.",

They had visited the Hunan province, which borders the Hubei province of which Wuhan is the capital. And right now, Wuhan is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\nSo when guests expressed their concern over attending the couple’s wedding, they came with an unusual plan. Instead of attending the celebrations at the venue, the couple, dressed in their wedding ensembles, live streamed from their hotel room with their friends and family, who enjoyed the occasion in the wedding hall.\nIn fact, the couple even made their toasts and their speeches on the video call.\n\"Some of them said they were not coming. We wanted to postpone the wedding but the hotel was not willing to. They said everything had been arranged and it was non-negotiable. So we felt like we had no choice but to proceed with the wedding,\" Yew told BBC.\nThough the guests were shocked in the beginning but they were relieved too, \"I think if we had been there, the atmosphere would be different. People would have been wary,\" he added.\nThe couple actually got married in China in October, and had planned a grand dinner banquet in Singapore for their family and friends who were unable to make it to China.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - Another group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from the epicenter of China’s fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak were placed under quarantine at two military bases in California on Wednesday, as the number of confirmed U.S. cases of the disease rose to 12.\nThe travelers aboard two State Department-chartered cargo jets were met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening, and are to remain under mandatory quarantine for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.\nFive of the passengers arrived exhibiting possible symptoms, two of them children, and were immediately hospitalized, along with the mother of one of the youngsters, the CDC said.\nThe latest evacuees, together with 195 Americans flown out of Wuhan, China, a week ago by the U.S. government, bring to 540 the number people subject so far to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years. Wuhan, in China’s Hubei province, is the epicenter of the disease.\nThe two planes in Wednesday’s airlift arrived at Travis Air Force Base in northern California, where 178 passengers from one plane disembarked to begin two weeks of round-the-clock health screening while barred from contact with the general public.\nNone of the group showed signs of disease, except for a small child who developed a fever during the flight and was taken to a nearby hospital with its mother for further testing and medical treatment in isolation, officials said. The other evacuees at Travis will be housed in a hotel on base.\nAfter refueling, the second evacuation plane flew on to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, arriving with 167 passenger. Of that group, three adults and a child “were determined to have a fever or a cough that warranted them being transported to a local hospital for further evaluation,” the CDC said\n. The rest were placed under quarantine at two housing sites on base.\n“Because these individuals were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, where there is intense and escalating community-wide spread of this novel coronavirus, we consider them at high risk of exposure,” said Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases.\n“We are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,” Braden told reporters during a briefing at Miramar.\nHe stressed that the CDC’s strategy of early detection and containment of individuals who are sick or at high risk of exposure has been successful in preventing widespread transmission in the United States so far.\n“If there were ongoing community spread of this virus we would know it, and that’s not happening,” Braden said. “So right now, in the United States, communities across this country are at very low risk of being exposed to this virus, including in San Diego and including on this base.”\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 500 people, most in and around Wuhan, and infected more than 28,000.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. The latest patient, reported in Wisconsin on Wednesday, is isolated at home and “doing well,” the state health agency said in a statement.\nAs with nine other U.S. cases documented to date, that person fell ill after traveling to China and was exposed to known cases there, the state health department said. Just two confirmed U.S. coronavirus cases were transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both between spouses\n.\nThe protocols in place at Travis and Miramar were previously instituted at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles, where the first group of Americans airlifted from Wuhan landed last Wednesday and are midway through their quarantine.\nThe CDC said the government expects to fly additional groups of Americans and their families from China to other U.S. military bases designated for quarantine in Texas and Nebraska.\nAs part of a U.S. public health emergency declared on Jan. 31 in response to the coronavirus crisis, the Trump administration has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently visited China.\nThe CDC also has ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited Wuhan or anywhere else in China’s Hubei Province during the past 14 days. Americans who traveled elsewhere in mainland China are subject to two weeks of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China will be directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers will be screened by the CDC.\nThe State Department also has issued a “Do Not Travel” advisory warning U.S. citizens against visits to China.\n",

No fatalities have been recorded outside China.\nThe mayor of Wuhan, which is the capital of Hubei province and at epicenter of the outbreak, said he expected another 1,000 new patients in the city, which was stepping up construction of special hospitals.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because much about it is still unknown, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.\nChina’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, during which infection can occur.\nThe Lunar New Year holiday, traditionally celebrated by hundreds of millions of Chinese traveling around the country and abroad to see family, began on Friday but has been severely disrupted by the outbreak.\nMa said China would intensify its containment efforts, which have so far included transport and travel curbs and cancellation of big events.\nThe virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai\n.\nAlibaba’s Taobao online marketplace said it has removed sales of face masks from shops that show “unstable prices or false advertising”, as prices for the products surged.\nThe World Health Organization this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can contain the epidemic.\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was on his way to Beijing to meet officials and health experts dealing with the coronavirus.\nChinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has six confirmed cases, will also ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, the city’s government said. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents.\nHubei’s governor, Wang Xiaodong, said on Sunday he felt “agonized” and responsible for the outbreak. He described the situation as severe and said medical supplies were still tight.\nChina confirmed 2,051 cases of infection as of 7 p.m. (1100 GMT) on Jan. 26, while the death toll from the virus remained at 56, state broadcaster CCTV reported.\nAirports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts.\nHealth officials in Orange County, California, said a third case had been registered in the United States in a traveler from Wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition.\nOn Sunday, China temporarily banned nationwide the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Wild and often poached animals packed together in Chinese markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans.\nThe New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society called on China to make the ban permanent.\nThe U.S. State Department said it will relocate personnel at its Wuhan consulate to the United States, while Japan was working with China to arrange a charter flight for Japanese nationals to return from Wuhan\n. Around 50 Italians in Wuhan and the Hubei region were offered transport out.\nThe outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within China, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown and  transport links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles.\nHealth authorities in Beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. The advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on Sunday morning.\nBeijing also postponed the reopening of the city’s schools and universities after the Lunar New Year holiday, state radio reported. Hong Kong had already delayed the reopening of schools to Feb. 17.\nChina has called for transparency in managing the crisis,  after public trust was eroded by a cover-up of the spread of  SARS, a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.\nBut officials in Wuhan have been criticized for their handling of the current outbreak.\n“People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,” said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located.\nIllustrating the extent of disruption to life in China, overall passenger travel declined by nearly 29% on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, from a year earlier, with air passengers down nearly 42%, a transportation ministry official said.\nMany cinemas across China were closed and cruise ship operators canceled some sailings that had been due to leave Chinese ports.\nIn Hong Kong, Disneyland and Ocean Park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily over the holiday, has already closed.\n(GRAPHIC: Spread of the new coronavirus - here)\n",

At the same time, it expressed confidence in the ability of China to control the epidemic. With more and more cases in China showing the spread of the epidemic, more and more countries are affected, including Russia and other multinational governments taking measures to close the border, the United States, the United Kingdom and France and other airlines have taken grounded flights, and some countries have begun to withdraw overseas Chinese.\nA Agence France-Presse reporter saw a white haired man wearing a mask and a more than 60 year old man who appeared to be on the street in Wuhan on January 30th. He suddenly fell dead and was holding a shopping bag. Wuhan used to be crowded with people. Now there are few pedestrians on the street. No one dares to approach the man who died on the side of the road.\nMedical staff and some onlookers were worried, and the atmosphere in the whole city of Wuhan was scared. The reporter reported that the Sixth Hospital of Wuhan is one of the main medical centers for the treatment of pneumonia patients in Wuhan. It is full of people waiting for examination.\nThe Chinese authorities have taken unprecedented measures to block the city, blocking roads and flights, and trying to stop the spread of the virus.\nFrench historian and Chinese expert Francois gudeming, now an Asia consultant at the University of Montaigne in France, said it was true that the Chinese government delayed acknowledging the outbreak and drew criticism. It is true that the Chinese government has not invested enough in public health, such as the lack of hospitals and freelance doctors. In the second stage, the Chinese government took urgent measures. Although it made life inconvenient for the local people, there was no other way. The Chinese government has taken relatively strict measures to control the spread of the epidemic to other countries.\nFor criticizing the lack of transparency of the Chinese government in dealing with the crisis, Gu Deming believes that it is true that the initial stage of the outbreak was like this. Although the central government was not completely transparent in dealing with the epidemic since January 20, especially in how to find the origin of the virus, there was little information from the outside world. At present, the Chinese government has not cooperated with the outside world, but it has improved compared with the outbreak of SARS in 2003 Time has improved. We can see some English articles published by Chinese criticizing the government's slow action. In addition, we can use wechat to report local officials' concealment of the epidemic, showing some changes.\nThe current situation is that China's new coronavirus can be transmitted to humans rapidly, and the number of cases is faster than that of 2003 SARS virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n。\nBut the initial symptoms of SARS are high fever and dry cough, which lead to dyspnea. In a few days, severe patients need artificial oxygen to survive. The latent period of the new coronavirus is almost asymptomatic.\nWuhan is suffering from severe pneumonia. The first French evacuation plane from Wuhan arrived at the southern isolation resort in France on Friday, and the second French evacuation plane arrived at home on Sunday.\nGerman Foreign Minister Maas said the German government on Friday sent a military aircraft to Wuhan, China, to withdraw more than 100 German citizens from the area hit by the virus, while providing the Chinese government with short supplies such as masks and 10000 sets of protective clothing.\n",

Since January 3, when the vast majority of Chinese people were still in the dark, China has begun to report the epidemic information to the United States, a total of 30 times. Generally speaking, Chinese people know about the situation, about after academician Zhong Nanshan revealed the message of Wuhan pneumonia on January 20. But the leaders of Hubei and Wuhan authorities were still in \"group worship\" on January 21 to watch art performances. Wuhan people and even the whole of China were not frightened until Wuhan was closed on the 23rd. That is to say, until the outbreak in Wuhan completely out of control!\nAt present, it is recognized that the earliest time to detect the epidemic is December 8. Even if the Beijing authorities can report the epidemic to the American public on January 3, the epidemic will not spread to the later stage. Wuhan city will not suddenly announce the closure of the city late on the 23rd night, which is the result of everyone's surprise and panic.\nSome netizens said: \"I told the Americans on January 3, but I didn't tell us the people of Hubei. I can't believe it if it's not officially announced by myself.\".\nAnother netizen commented: the Chinese official said that since the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, 30 times of China's epidemic situation had been reported to the U.S., \"people's wrath! While catching the doctors who published the true information of the virus, they kept reporting to the U.S. while not telling the truth! They kept hiding the key points of the people for 20 days. What kind of regime is this? They regard the people as grass mustard and ruminant dogs!\"\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist, commented: has the foreign ministry missed the point? I know everything from top to bottom, but I have to hide the Chinese people. How can I hate them to do this\n。\nCompared with Wuhan pneumonia, influenza is said to be ignorant\nA spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry criticized the United States for not helping China in real terms. It cited the example of the US influenza to compare with the new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosed in China. It said that \"the 2019-2020 influenza season in the United States has infected 19 million people and at least ten thousand people have died.\"\nBut experts believe that the flu can not be compared with Wuhan pneumonia or SARS at all. First, the case fatality rate is not in an order of magnitude. The case fatality rate of SARS is 10%, and that of Wuhan pneumonia is 3%. However, according to the statement that more than 10 million people in the United States are infected with influenza and nearly 10000 people died, the case fatality rate is only 0.05%. The severity varies, and many flu strains have vaccines.\nHua Chunying is here to talk about the U.S. flu, deliberately ignoring the situation in China. In fact, according to the report of the lancet quoted by the Southern Metropolis Daily on September 21 last year, 88000 people die of influenza every year in China, far more than the official data.\nChina treats us and Russia differently\nHua Chunying's purpose in taking this example is to show that the US side is not enough. According to Hua Chunying's statement, China's accusation against the United States is mainly that the United States \"made a special response to the Chinese epidemic and took excessive measures, which obviously ran counter to the WHO recommendations\".\nTo prevent the outbreak, Russia, which is close to China, recently blocked the 4250 km border between Russia and China, cut off the railway lines between the two countries, restricted flights, restricted Chinese tourists and suspended the issuance of visas to Chinese workers. What's more, Russian Prime Minister announced on Monday that he would take severe measures to deport Russian patients infected with the new coronavirus, which is also considered to be aimed at the Chinese.\nInternet users commented on Russia's move that \"only the powerful people with centralized power can take such anti humanitarian measures to seal up cities and expel foreigners\".\nBut China does not say a word about this extreme measure.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "According to the introduction: radcivir is a new experimental broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed by Gilead science company of the United States, which is believed to effectively inhibit the replication of SARS virus and mers virus in respiratory epithelial cells. Although the drug is still in phase III clinical trials against the Ebola virus, the latest news shows that the drug takes effect immediately after being used in a patient infected with \"Wuhan pneumonia\" in the United States. The news came out that the Wuhan virus Institute immediately applied for patent for Reed's new version of the 2019 coronavirus. In addition, 270 samples of the drug were sent to Beijing China Japan Friendship Hospital for clinical trial of \"Wuhan pneumonia\" patients.\nOn Tuesday, the official website of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that they had applied for a Chinese invention patent for the U.S. new drug readcivir, which had not been officially used yet, as early as January 21, while the day before January 21, the Chinese official just officially announced that Wuhan pneumonia is a serious human to human infectious disease. That is to say, the research on the efficacy of ridacivir by Wuhan Virus Research Institute has been carried out long before that. When Wu Han was ignorant and ignorant that he was at risk of infection, Wuhan's top Chinese Academy of Sciences Virus Research Institute had discovered an effective drug against new official coronavirus without official name.\nSure enough, Wuhan Virus Research Institute is not only mysterious, but also really awesome. Maybe it is really ahead of the virus. But this is where people's fear is now, and it also deepens the worries about the source of various viruses. Many people know that Wuhan Virus Research Institute is the highest level Virus Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but they do not understand why in the process of the spread of Wuhan pneumonia virus, this institution is extremely low-key. Wuhan's mountains and rivers support this institution for virus research, but Wuhan people have become the biggest victims of the virus. After the outbreak was announced, many factors promoted the Wuhan Virus Research Institute, which was hidden in the boudoir, to the public, but it was still covered with mystery.\nAs for the rush to register and use patents, Wuhan Virus Research Institute may be motivated to show that it wants to contribute to the country, but it is puzzling because of the use of the term \"invention patent\". According to Free Asia report, the news ignited public opinion, and netizens left messages to discuss\n。 Some netizens said, \"do you know who has seized the treatment patent of\" ridacivir \"in China? Wuhan Virus Research Institute, together with military units, on January 21, rushed to \"use ridacivir to treat 2019 new coronavirus patent\", and spread the rights and interests to the world through international agreements. What kind of operation is this? \"\nSome netizens also pointed out that \"free drugs from the United States have been patented by Wuhan Virus Research Institute!\"! American free open molecular structure, to China's treatment of pneumonia medicine radcivir by the virus by the brand, Americans completely ignorant of it! Let's see how the snake killed the farmer! \"\nNetizens criticized and said, \"it's shameless! Take what others give painstakingly and selflessly, change it a little, and then become your own thing, and register for patent to make a lot of money. \" \"This is the most shameless thing in the world! We don't try our best to do real work for the anti epidemic situation. We really spend a lot of time on opportunism, striving for fame and wealth for ourselves, and stealing other people's achievements! It's disgusting! \" \"People all over the world know the fact that the Communist Party is not afraid that the whole world will be besieged and beaten when it plays with hooligans like this?\"\nRen Zhao, a Zhengzhou lawmaker, sent an open letter to Wuhan Virus Research Institute on Wednesday, urging it to disclose details of the virus research process. He said that many people had reported the management confusion of Wuhan Virus Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences under their real names, and then deleted the post. The licensing application includes the details of virus preservation and access to the Institute from 2019 to 2020, the details of research and development of coronavirus in the Institute, the detailed documents of research and development process and patent application of radcivir, and the research direction, published papers and detailed resumes of Professor Shi Zhengli in the Institute.\nAbout the source of the new crown pneumonia virus in Wuhan, Chinese officials have cited the source of the virus to the Southern China seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. But Indian researchers recently published a paper saying that four inserts of the new coronavirus were similar to HIV, and they suspected that the outbreak in China was related to the leakage of samples from Wuhan virus Institute.\nOn February 4, Xu Bo, chairman of the mainland's Duoyi network, tweeted that his real name had reliable evidence as a clue to report to Wuhan Virus Research Institute. Xu Bo cited some basic facts, and attached several evidence links such as \"paper published by Shi Zhengli of Wuhan Virus Research Institute\".\nXu Bo said that because the epidemic prevention is of great importance, it is suspected that Wuhan Virus Research Institute has mismanaged the experimental animals, causing the outflow of experimental animals, leading to the 2019 new coronavirus epidemic\n。 He also stressed, \"I clearly believe that the genetically modified virus developed by Shi Zhengli in 2015 is different from the new coronavirus in Wuhan, but there must be a large number of other similar viruses in his laboratory, and then there must be further research on similar viruses, which is the truth that should be investigated.\"\nThe White House's chief strategist, ban Nong, said on Monday (February 3rd) that the Chinese Communist Party lied about everything. If the new coronavirus was found to be artificially synthesized, the Communist Party of China would be finished.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "According to the booking data of the global online travel booking platform Agoda, Japan is the first choice country for Chinese tourists to celebrate the Spring Festival, among which Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo and Kyoto are all selected as the top ten hot destinations for the Spring Festival in 2020, ranking the third and sixth respectively. However, China stopped overseas group tourism of Chinese tourists from January 27, which caused great economic losses to Japan.\nSince January 24th, many tourists have arrived in Japan, and because the epidemic of new coronavirus pneumonia is spreading, Japanese tourist destinations are welcoming Chinese tourists to Japan for tourism consumption and fear of pneumonia. Therefore, Japan's Ministry of foreign affairs has raised the level of infectious disease warning to Hubei in Wuhan Province on the 24 day to three level. Go. This is the first time that Japan has issued a \"three-level\" warning with a lower severity since adopting four levels of infectious disease risk information in 2015.\n26, the Ministry of health and labour said that more than 40 year old Chinese men who had visited Wuhan from Japan had contracted the new coronavirus and had pneumonia symptoms. The man is now in hospital in Aichi county. Although he has a fever, his condition is stable at present. This is the fourth case found in Japan.\nJapan's Ministry of land and communications held an important meeting in the province to prevent the expansion of the new form of coronavirus infection on 24 April, confirming the need to implement the border crossings in airports and harbors. \"There are 2080 flights from China to Japan, about 400000 seats,\" said the Minister of state communications, Chiyu Yijia. There are 15 cruises, about 35000 people coming. \" Since January 27, the overseas group travel industry of China has all stopped overseas travel, which has a great impact on Japan's tourism industry. Chinese overseas travel to Japan accounts for about one-third of all overseas travel. Hotels around Japan have received notice of check-out. Department stores also tend to rely on foreign tourists to generate income in recent years, some of which face 100% of foreign tourists The Chinese are the biggest customers in the store, accounting for 80% - 90% of the sales. During the Spring Festival, it is a concentrated sales period. In 2019, the consumption of foreign tourists is 481.3 billion yen, of which 36.8% are tourists from mainland China, accounting for 1771.8 billion yen. However, this new pneumonia epidemic will be the second heavy blow to Japan's tourism economy after Japan's relations with South Korea worsened and South Korean tourists greatly reduced. Japanese businesses are sighing for this, hoping that the epidemic will subside as soon as possible\n。\nJapan has now decided to designate the new coronavirus pneumonia as \"designated infection\", requiring all Chinese passengers arriving at the airport to have their own cough and fever and accept infrared temperature sensors.\nKyoto Prefecture and Kyoto City are popular tourist destinations for Chinese tourists. Kyoto and Beijing have stepped up their vigilance with the emergence of new coronavirus pneumonia cases in Japan. In a 24-day interview with a reporter from a governor of the Kyoto government, governor Longjun Nishiya pointed out that he would appeal to the residents of the government for the prevention strategies of routine hand washing and wearing masks, and that all aspects of the infection of the pneumonia should be \"prevented before it happens\", and that the infection should not be allowed to expand, but should be responded with a sense of tension. The \"Brocade market\" in the central Beijing area, a popular market among foreigners, mainly sells traditional vegetables and fresh fish in Kyoto, with more than 120 stores in a row. Jinshizhenxing street trade union appealed to shops in the market to take measures to prevent respiratory tract infection, such as wearing masks and washing hands frequently.\nDue to the warm climate, Japan's zuoka county is close to China geographically, and it is also a favorite place for Chinese tourists to visit in winter. Starting from the large-scale continuous holiday of Spring Festival on the 24th, there are many airport and accommodation facilities for Chinese tourists to visit Japan in zuoka county. Zuoka has strengthened the prevention measures against infection. The notice urging tourists from China to fill in the health status registration card will be issued from the 25th after the flyer is posted at zoga airport.\nThe aircraft under the jurisdiction of Fukuoka quarantine office, including the zoga airport, has posted flyers since January 8. No matter whether they have been in Wuhan or not, if they are taking cough medicine and antipyretics, they also need to report to the quarantine officer.\nIn Tokyo, tourist attractions such as the Tokyo district's shallow grass culture and tourism center in Taitung have posted leaflets on new coronavirus pneumonia, and visitors who wish to seek medical treatment because of poor physical condition will confirm their stay experience before visiting Japan.\nOn the 25 day, the Tokyo metropolitan government issued a new announcement on pneumonia related information on the website of the infectious disease information center in Tokyo. It said that in order to strengthen the prevention and control of new coronavirus infection in Wuhan and other cities, effectively prevent the spread of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus infection, and ensure the health and safety of Japanese tourists and Japanese citizens, the general infectious diseases were introduced.

We are finding the best treatment for the patient,” he said at a media conference, here, today.Currently, there are 25 confirmed coronavirus cases in Thailand of whom 19 are China nationals and six Thais. Seventeen remain in hospitals while the other eight have been discharged and have returned home.Last Friday, Thailand confirmed its first case of human-to-human transmission when a taxi driver tested positive.Earlier, a 42-year-old South Korean woman had tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand.Suwanchai said the Public Health Ministry was unsure of where the patient caught the virus.“We are coordinating with the relevant Korean authority while waiting for further lab test results,” he said.The media reported that the woman who returned to South Korea from Thailand on Jan 19 had shown symptoms for the infection six days later.Meanwhile, a total of 142 Thais in Hubei Province including its capital Wuhan are expected to arrive at U-Tapao Airport, located about 150 km southeast of the Thai capital, at 8.30 pm (local time) today.They will be examined and quarantined for 14 days before being allowed to return home. Meanwhile, a Thai AirAsia chartered flight carrying 138 Thais from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, arrived at U-Tapao International Airport in Rayong at 8.30 pm (local time).Deputy Prime Minister and Public Health Minister Anutin Chanvirakul, who was present at the airport, said three Thais were denied permission to board on the first evacuation flight out of Wuhan.“Two students were not allowed to board because their body temperature was higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius. Another Thai man was denied permission to board as he had overstayed for seven months,” he told the media tonight.He added that the two students would be quarantined for 14 days at their living quarters in Wuhan and the relevant authorities would take care of them.The Thais who returned from Wuhan tonight will have to undergo health screening at the airport and will be quarantined for 14 days at a navy-operated hotel at Sattahip Naval Base in Chon Buri before they are allowed to return home.-- BERNAMA         \r\n ",

We will stop placing them in the isolation ward if they test negative for the virus and have fully recovered.“Usually, the results of the detection test sent to the Institute of Medical Research will be known within 24 hours, and if the test is confirmed positive we will continue isolating and closely monitoring the patient,” she said when contacted by Bernama today.Known as 2019-nCoV, the coronavirus that causes respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, was first detected in December in Wuhan, China, with symptoms of infection including fever, cough and difficulty in breathing.Dr Yasmin said staff caring for coronavirus patients were also experienced in dealing with infectious diseases.“We have a highly trained dedicated team who will take care of the patients. They (doctor/nurse) will go in pairs (for monitoring) minimum twice a day.“Why in pairs? So they can monitor each other to avoid any treatment errors and so on.

Also avoid contact with wild animals, and it is safe to wear face mask.“Those who have a sore throat, cough or other symptoms are advised to see a doctor as soon as possible,” she said.-- BERNAMA",

Since then, it has spread to nearly thirty countries.\n\"This is the first reported\nDeath outside China,\"said WHO representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe in\nManila! He added, however, that it should be borne in mind that the man did not\nthe Philippines.\nThe deceased is a 44-year-old male on 25th.

However, he was in stable condition and signs of recovery\nIt went on. Surprisingly, the\nhis condition in the last 24 hours then again\nHe died in a hospital in Manila.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected\nYeah.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals.

Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known.

The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nLike the Philippine\nHealth Minister Francisco Duque said the man had traveled to the country alongside a Chinese woman who had also tested positive for the virus. The woman rests\ncurrently in hospital from the infection.\nShortly before the death, the Philippine government had closed the country's border to all foreign immigrants from China.

After\nAuthorities have so far reported that 304 patients have died from the virus in China. More than 14.300 people have been infected in the country. Nine cases are known in Germany.

A passenger on board a German military machine with which more than 100 Germans had returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan on Saturday is suspected of carrying the virus.\nWuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, is considered to be the center of the expansion and is under quarantine. It is currently believed that the virus of wild animals was transmitted to humans in a market. Because of the rapid spread of the virus, for the first time a city outside the province of Hubei has severely restricted the freedom of movement of its inhabitants. In the nine-million-inhabitant metropolis of Wenzhou on the east coast of China, only one person per household is allowed to go on the street every two days to buy the most necessary for life, local authorities said. The city also closed 46 motorway toll stations.\nThe Chinese government also called on the weekend to postpone weddings and to hold mourning parties in a small framework.

Or have there been cases in individual African states for a long time that nobody has registered? A report published by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board at least found worldwide gaps in the preparation for epidemics and an investigation by the Center for Health Security of Johns Hopkins University showed that the worst prepared countries are found almost all in Africa. In fact, there is a shortage of everything: laboratories to detect pathogens, isolation rooms and personnel.\nBut first of all, in order to suffocate an epidemic in the germ, good reporting systems are needed. Because the faster cases are detected, the fewer people can infect the infected. John Nkengasong says the African Disease Protection Agency has already set up a task force to assist countries\nYeah. In addition, each country should have a rapid response force, and already today, all airports would be looking for infected people, with questionnaires and temperature scanners. Such a screening would be carried out anyway because of the outbreak of Ebola in Congo that has been going on for a year and a half.\nHowever, it is difficult to say how well these measures really work in the event of a coronation. It certainly also depends on which country in sub-Saharan Africa is dealing with the first cases of corona viruses. Some countries, such as Ghana or Nigeria, are better prepared than regions where war is raging and governments are unstable, such as South Sudan or the Central African Republic. There, for example, the virus is likely to have almost free circulation.\nAlso, finding new cases will not be easy, says Gerard Krause of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research: \"In large parts of Africa, people think of malaria first if someone has a fever.\" So it is also a matter of training health professionals that in addition to diseases such as malaria, Lassa, Ebola and meningococcal meningitis could also hide the corona virus behind a fever.\nKrause has been helping to set up a system in Nigeria since 2017, and last but not least in Ghana, called Sormas. One must imagine it as a platform that connects all those involved in a health system digitally: the laboratory, the district doctor, the village health worker and the health authority. For example, if a health care worker suspects an infection with the new corona virus, deposits it on a tablet and takes a blood sample, explains Krause, different things happen at the same time: the laboratory is notified that a sample is on its way\nYeah. The health authorities and the district doctor receive an alert and the health care worker is instructed to isolate the suspect and search for people he was dealing with.\nIf we succeed in finding a suspect, the question remains as to how it will be confirmed. At the beginning of February, there were only two laboratories throughout Africa testing samples of patients on the 2019-nCoV virus. The evidence of a suspicious case in the Ivory Coast had to be sent to Europe first, said Michael Yao, TIME ONLINE. It took days to establish a false alarm. In the coming days, twelve laboratories in sub-Saharan Africa should be able to test for the new Coronavirus, Yao says. John Nkengasong assumes that he will soon be available in 15 to 20 countries.\nFinding patients quickly and then isolating them is even more important in much of Africa than elsewhere. Because most health systems in sub-Saharan Africa may be too weak to care for the sick in the event of a major corona virus outbreak. There are no surface quarantine stations with ventilation machines used in the event of severe pneumonia caused by the corona virus. In addition, there is a shortage of skilled workers in almost all countries of sub-Saharan Africa. While in Germany statistically approximately 42 doctors arrive at 10.000 people, in Ethiopia there is exactly one, in Somalia even only 0.2*.\nIn many countries, the most elementary is missing, says political scientist Ilona Kickbusch, who has advised the federal government on global health issues: \"This already begins with the protection coat and medicines.\" Also, in many countries with weak health systems, there are logistical problems. Bringing respiratory masks into affected areas may take days, much too long for the contagious corona virus\nYeah.\nThe weakness of some health systems was also the main reason to call for an international health emergency, said the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on 30th. January: \"We do not know what damage this virus can do if it spreads to a country with a weaker health system. We must act now to prepare for this possibility.\"\nJohn Nkengasong says: \"I can only call on the international community to help African countries now, and not to wait until the continent is completely overwhelmed.\" An outbreak like in China would not stand up to the health systems of most states.\nThe Gates Foundation, which has been investing millions in global health for years, has already promised Nkengansong's authority four or five million euros to take action against the new Coronavirus. I got 05. In February, the Foundation then declared that it would invest another 90 million euros to combat the Coronavirus, approximately 18 million of which would go to African countries. Some African states, such as Sudan, requested 04. In February, at the meeting of the WHO Executive Board, explicitly asked for help. On the one hand, it was about training professionals for the prevention and treatment of the Coronavirus,\"says Mathias Bonk of the Institute for Global Health in Berlin. And secondly, they need materials like test kits, masks and protective suits. Some of these problems are intended to resolve a strategy plan tailored specifically to the new Coronavirus presented by the WHO this week.\nJohn Nkengansong of the African Disease Protection Agency also spoke to the World Bank and asked the public health authorities of the USA and China for logistical assistance. It was precisely the Americans who helped in recent health crises in sub-Saharan Africa.\nYeah. But what if the US itself experiences a severe corona virus outbreak? This fear is also driving many people around at the moment: that the classical donor countries could be so busy with outbreaks of the virus that they are no longer helping.\nMichel Yao says the WHO emergency team is also in contact with non-governmental organisations such as the Red Cross and doctors without borders. In some places, if the virus reaches them, African states could benefit from such existing partnerships. In such cases, for example, Ebola treatment centres in the Congo could then be converted to places where people with a coronary virus infection are isolated and treated.\nHowever, Ilona Kickbusch also stresses that it needs not only money and supplies, but also a strategy to explain measures such as quarantine and isolation of patients to the people in the affected areas. In the past Ebola outbreaks this proved to be a problem: men in yellow protective suits, so it must be many villagers have depicted, came, brought healthy people and brought back dead. Of course, conspiracy theories emerged, making it even more difficult for treatment teams to gain the trust of the population.\nGerard Krause of the Helmholtz Institute for Infection Research is in contact with various African states. They are thinking about using their Sormas system, just like Ghana and Nigeria. There the system has already helped 2017 and 2018 to control an outbreak of monkey pox, says Krause. Even if it may be too late for the new Coronavirus, another epidemic with a new pathogen is bound to come. This should be prepared by an ever closer-knit Africa.\nRead all about the new Coronavirus on our topic page.\n*Correction note: Initially the text stated how many doctors on 10.000 people in the respective country are coming incorrectly\nYeah. This has been corrected.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "四大洲已经传播到了新的冠状病毒：从中国，人们把它传播到亚洲、澳大利亚、欧洲和北美的其他地区。然而，在非洲，它还没有到达。但如果呢？这种病原体已经造成500人死亡，数万人感染，它将袭击这里的国家，这些国家的卫生系统可能和世界上其他任何地方一样脆弱。最坏的情况是，这可能意味着数十万人受到感染，数千人死亡。因为撒哈拉以南非洲的许多地区今天已经出现了重大问题：疟疾、艾滋病毒和结核病的流行以及糖尿病和高血压等慢性病的增加不仅削弱了人们的力量，而且使那些缺乏医院、医生、护士和医疗服务的国家负担过重。\n即使他们与数字和预测作斗争，许多专家也非常害怕这种情况。世界卫生组织执行局会议3日举行。官员们说，2月份，非洲成员国的情绪非常紧张。三年前，非洲联盟主席约翰恩肯格松（johnnkangasong）在两次电话会议之间说：“我们正面临前所未有的危险。”\n即使在2003年的非典疫情中，撒哈拉以南非洲国家也基本上幸免于难，只有南非登记了一例病例。然而，有了新的冠状病毒，没有人应该希望它会如此顺利：中国和许多非洲国家之间的联系变得过于紧密。数以万计的中国客座工人在非洲大陆工作，每年有成千上万的非洲学生带着大学奖学金前往中国\n是 啊。在过去的十年里，从非洲到中国的空中交通一直在下降。\n2019年底，中国当局向世界卫生组织（世卫组织）报告说，中国中部城市武汉的肺炎频发，原因不明。一周后，中国的研究人员发现了一种新的病毒。属于冠状病毒属。几天后，柏林查理特病毒学家克里斯蒂安·德罗斯滕（Christian Drosten）周围的一个小组公布了新病毒的第一个诊断测试，研究人员暂时称之为2019年nCoV。该试验可用于在实验室检测病毒。作为病原体的来源，中国当局怀疑武汉的一个食品市场，除了鱼和海鲜外，还出售蛇等外来动物。市场被关闭并消毒。\n呼吸系统疾病Sars（严重急性呼吸系统综合征）和Mers（中东呼吸系统综合征）都是由源自动物的冠状病毒引起的。在2002年和2003年的非典大流行期间，大约有8000人死亡，超过750人。从2012年发现到2019年底，Mers病毒已经感染了大约2500人，每三分之一的人都死于该病毒。然而，总的来说，冠状病毒有几百种。其中许多会影响呼吸道，并可能导致感冒。\n在中国，现在有几千人患病，其中一些人，很可能是预先感染的，已经死于病毒引起的肺炎。泰国、日本和韩国是中国以外的第一批感染者。这些是以前去过武汉的旅客。我有21个。今年1月，美国当局报告了24日从武汉返回的一名游客的第一次感染\n是 啊。一月份，法国的第一例病例被发现。与此同时，德国的首批病例也得到证实。感染的典型症状是发烧、咳嗽和呼吸困难。这种病毒可以引起肺炎，最终导致死亡。因为这是一种病毒性疾病，抗生素没有帮助。\n现在很明显，这种病毒可以在人与人之间传播。中国当局在大约12名医务人员接到通知后，已经确认了几起此类传输。医生认为这种病毒主要是通过液滴感染传播的。世界卫生组织，就像24日一样。1月，目前报道1、4至2、5节感染者感染他人。如果这些数字持续存在，这种病毒的传染性比非典和流感病毒要低。世卫组织建议遵守一般卫生规则：勤洗手，避免与呼吸道疾病患者和野生动物密切接触。\n还没办法确定。世界卫生组织28日分享。1月份，报告的病例中约有五分之一受到病毒的严重影响，因此如有疑问，需要加强医疗治疗。据报道，第一批受害者是一些有严重既往疾病的患者。其他传染病也对患有流感等既往疾病的人构成特别危险。已知冠状病毒会变异，因此它们可以改变它们的遗传。这可能导致它们在暴发期间对人类变得更危险，但也恰恰相反。罗伯特·科赫研究所（RKI）目前预计，死亡率不会与非典疫情相似。\n是 啊。\n非洲大陆许多国家与中国有着密切的经济关系。比如肯尼亚和埃塞俄比亚。对埃塞俄比亚来说，中国是最重要的经济伙伴，贸易额超过50亿美元。在肯尼亚，中国政府资助了肯尼亚历史上最大的基础设施项目之一，一列连接内罗毕首都和沿海大都市蒙巴萨的高速列车。这列火车是中国国家主席习近平2013年发起的新丝绸之路倡议的一部分。中国正在投资数十亿欧元建设基础设施项目，以建立全球贸易基地。\n而上周，在埃塞俄比亚和肯尼亚，电话里都出现了几起疑似冠状病毒的病例，负责世卫组织非洲紧急项目的米歇尔·姚说姚明说：“我们已经接到很多警报。不过，这是一个好兆头，因为它表明监测系统在许多地方都起作用。\n但这是真的吗？或者，非洲个别国家长期以来是否存在无人登记的案件？全球防备监测委员会（Global preparency Monitoring Board）发表的一份报告至少发现全球在流行病防备方面存在差距，约翰霍普金斯大学（Johns Hopkins University）卫生安全中心（Center for Health Security）的一项调查显示，准备最差的国家几乎都在非洲。事实上，这里缺乏一切：检测病原体的实验室、隔离室和人员。\n但首先，为了扼杀细菌中的流行病，需要良好的报告系统。因为发现病例的速度越快，感染者的人数就越少。约翰恩肯格松说，非洲疾病保护机构已经成立了一个特别工作组来帮助各国\n是 啊。此外，每个国家都应该有一支快速反应部队，今天，所有机场都将通过问卷调查和温度扫描仪寻找感染者。这样的筛查无论如何都会进行，因为刚果的埃博拉疫情已经持续了一年半。\n然而，很难说这些措施在加冕典礼上的实际效果如何。这当然也取决于撒哈拉以南非洲的哪个国家正在处理第一批冠状病毒病例。一些国家，如加纳或尼日利亚，比战争肆虐、政府不稳定的地区，如南苏丹或中非共和国，准备得更好。例如，在那里，病毒很可能几乎可以自由传播。\n此外，赫尔姆霍兹传染病研究中心的杰拉德·克劳斯说，发现新病例并不容易：“在非洲大部分地区，如果有人发烧，人们首先会想到疟疾。”因此，除了疟疾、拉萨等疾病外，还需要培训卫生专业人员，埃博拉和脑膜炎球菌性脑膜炎也可能在发烧后隐藏冠状病毒。\nKrause自2017年以来一直在帮助尼日利亚建立一个系统，最后但并非最不重要的是在加纳建立了一个名为Sormas的系统。人们必须把它想象成一个平台，将所有参与医疗系统的人数字化地连接起来：实验室、地区医生、村卫生工作者和卫生局。例如，如果一名医护人员怀疑感染了新的科罗纳病毒，将其放在药片上并采集血液样本，克劳斯解释说，不同的事情同时发生：实验室接到通知，样本正在路上\n是 啊。卫生当局和地区医生收到警报，医护人员奉命隔离嫌犯，并搜索他正在与之打交道的人。\n如果我们成功地找到了一名嫌疑犯，如何确认这一点仍然是个问题。2月初，整个非洲只有两个实验室检测2019年nCoV病毒患者样本。《时代》网络版的迈克尔•姚（Michael Yao）说，象牙海岸一宗可疑案件的证据必须先送到欧洲。花了好几天才建立起一个假警报。姚说，在未来几天，撒哈拉以南非洲的12个实验室应该能够检测出新的冠状病毒。约翰恩肯格松认为他很快就会在15到20个国家出现。\n在非洲大部分地区，快速找到病人，然后隔离他们比其他地方更为重要。因为撒哈拉以南非洲的大多数卫生系统可能太弱，一旦发生重大的科罗纳病毒爆发，就无法照顾病人。没有地面检疫站，在电晕病毒引起严重肺炎的情况下使用通风机。此外，撒哈拉以南非洲几乎所有国家都缺乏熟练工人。据统计，在德国，约有42名医生到达10000人，而在埃塞俄比亚只有一名医生，在索马里甚至只有0.2*。\n政治学家伊洛娜•基克布希（Ilona Kickbusch）曾就全球卫生问题向联邦政府提供建议，她说，在许多国家，最基本的问题已经不见了：“这已经从防护服和药品开始了。”此外，在许多卫生系统薄弱的国家，还存在后勤问题。把呼吸面罩带到受感染的地区可能需要几天时间，对传染性冠状病毒来说太长了\n是 啊。\n世卫组织总干事特德罗·阿达诺姆·盖布雷耶苏30日说，一些卫生系统的薄弱也是呼吁国际卫生紧急情况的主要原因。一月：“我们不知道这种病毒如果传播到一个卫生系统较弱的国家会造成什么样的损害。我们现在必须采取行动，为这种可能性做好准备。”\n约翰恩肯格松（John Nkengasong）说：“我现在只能呼吁国际社会帮助非洲国家，而不是等到非洲大陆完全崩溃。”像中国这样的疫情将无法对抗大多数国家的卫生系统。\n盖茨基金会多年来一直在全球卫生领域投资数百万美元，它已经承诺，恩肯桑格的权力机构将拿出四五百万欧元，对新的冠状病毒采取行动。我得了05分。今年2月，该基金会宣布将再投资9000万欧元抗击冠状病毒，其中约1800万欧元将流向非洲国家。一些非洲国家，如苏丹，要求04。今年2月，在世卫组织执行理事会会议上，明确要求提供帮助。柏林全球卫生研究所的马蒂亚斯·邦克说：“一方面，这是为了培训专业人员预防和治疗冠状病毒。其次，他们需要测试包、口罩和防护服等材料。其中一些问题旨在解决世卫组织本周提出的专门针对新型冠状病毒的战略计划。\n非洲疾病保护机构的约翰·恩肯扬森（John Nkengansong）也与世界银行（World Bank）进行了交谈，并向美国和中国的公共卫生当局寻求后勤援助。正是美国人帮助了撒哈拉以南非洲最近的健康危机。\n是 啊。但是，如果美国自己经历了一场严重的冠状病毒爆发呢？这种恐惧也驱使许多人在此刻四处奔走：传统的捐助国可能忙于病毒的爆发，以至于不再提供帮助。\n姚明说，世卫组织紧急救援小组还与红十字会和无国界医生组织等非政府组织保持联系。在一些地方，如果病毒传播到非洲国家，非洲国家可以从这种现有的伙伴关系中获益。例如，在这种情况下，刚果的埃博拉治疗中心可能会被转为隔离和治疗冠心病患者的地方。\n不过，伊洛娜·基克布希也强调，它不仅需要资金和物资，还需要一项战略，向灾区人民解释隔离和隔离病人等措施。在过去的埃博拉疫情中，这证明是一个问题：身穿黄色防护服的男子，因此必须许多村民描绘，来到，带来了健康的人，带回了死亡。当然，阴谋论的出现，使得治疗团队更难获得民众的信任。\n赫尔姆霍兹感染研究所的杰拉德·克劳斯正在与非洲各国接触。他们正在考虑使用他们的Sormas系统，就像加纳和尼日利亚一样。克劳斯说，该系统已经帮助2017年和2018年控制了猴痘的爆发。即使对新的冠状病毒来说已经太迟了，另一种带有新病原体的流行病也必将到来。这应该由一个更加紧密的非洲来准备。\n在我们的主题页上阅读所有关于新冠状病毒的内容。\n*更正说明：最初的文本说明了在各自国家10000人中有多少医生来错了\n是 啊。这已经纠正了。\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "He is now the most famous virologist in Germany. 2003, he has deciphered the Sars virus, now developing the first detection test for the new Coronavirus from Wuhan. Everyone's been asking for his advice ever since. It should be impossible to get close to Christian Drosten.\nBut the director of the Institute of Virology at the Berlin Charite is radically adhering to a strategy that he has already made his credo during the Sars epidemic: all information must be out, everything must be made public. It's the only way to keep a virus in check. So Christian Drosten is in a hurry, he is a little late, he was just in the Foreign Office, last Monday in his office, quickly looks through a few emails, takes a place at a round natural wood table, leans back and is focused.\nIs the situation not much better today than during the Sars epidemic, given the technical progress?\" I don't know,\"Drosten says. On the one hand, with many genome analyses, it has been very quickly discovered that the virus has not been circulating among humans for very long.\" This is good to assess the epidemic.\"On the other hand, the mobility of Chinese society has changed drastically.\"The Chinese society has changed a lot. I can well imagine that the rapid spread of the current virus can only be explained by this.\"\nThe 47-year-old physician has spent his entire professional life dealing with coronary viruses. When the Sars pathogen (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) entered its course at the end of 2002, no one knew at first what kind of germ it was. At that time Christian Drosten worked at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg and developed diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. The young scientist was able to identify the agent of Sars, a Coronavirus similar to the current 2019-nCoV in China.\nYeah.\nAt the time, he was able to present a proof test with a colleague. Two years later, he was awarded the Federal Merit Cross. When he was only 35 years old, Drosten moved to the Institute of Virology at Bonn University Hospital, and ten years later he joined the Charity.\nThere, the virologist and his team have been tracking every angle of the new Coronavirus for weeks now. Without having it in the lab himself, he developed the test for it.\nDrosten doesn't claim to understand the virus yet. Like all parties involved, he has to deal with the fact that the data situation changes hourly. At first it was said from China that the virus could not be transmitted from person to person. That was soon past. Then it was said that drastic measures such as the closure of entire metropolises could contain the virus in China. A false assumption.\nThe image of the Coronavirus is sharper than that of the fast-moving media world. That is why Drosten formulates only one working hypothesis on this day: the new Coronavirus is basically like Sars. At this point he deduces that 2019-nCoV can only be transmitted by people with symptoms.\nOne day later, it is said that in Bavaria, a Chinese woman from Shanghai transmitted the virus to employees of a company, allegedly asymptomatic. An alarm signal: In asymptomatic hosts, the virus can travel far unknown and infect many people on the way. In the renowned New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) a specialist article on the Bavarian case appears, the Global Health Emergency is called by the WHO.\nA week later, it is clear that the Chinese woman had back pain and was taking a fever-reducing medicine, which is why the infection was not noticed, and that the authors of the article had not spoken to the Chinese woman. Christian Drosten's name was also included in the publication. He's uncomfortable with that.\nYeah. Normally, one examines all the facts in a group of authors, he says, \"but in this case I simply had to trust the authors who have spent much longer on the case history of patients\". As a confirmation laboratory, he only supplied data, which he stands for.\nBut isn't this breakdown an example of how premature publication of data is harmful?\nBut threats remain with his demand for maximum transparency. The fact that the patient had lectures despite the illness and could infect colleagues shows that the virus spread more easily than initially suspected. But the breakdown with the article in the NEJM proves another worrying development.\" Journals today actively press for speed and want sensation.\"And this also applies to high-level publications.\nDrosten published the very first paper on the novel Coronavirus in Eurosurveillance, the scientific journal of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. \"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control We could have published it in the NEJM,\"he says,\"but we didn't do it intentionally.\"He was more concerned that all data be made fully available online so that everyone can read it.\nThe only thing that helps in a situation with insufficient data is transparency, Drosten says. It is only when all the information is immediately available to the relevant institutions that incorrect assumptions can be corrected and proper reactions can be initiated. When he advocated this rigorous demand during the Sars epidemic and published genetic data early, he says it was \"totally unusual\". And today he is angry that some colleagues still did not understand it and withheld important current data.\nDrosten also fights behind the scenes for science journals to introduce new transparency rules\nYeah. Manuscripts should only be accepted as part of an outbreak if the authors simultaneously deposited the data on a publicly accessible pre-print server.\" This is the only regulation that can work to finally achieve transparency in this system or to prevent the system from slowing down progress in the fight against epidemics.\"\nThe virologist himself also practices transparency in the public. A colleague of his says that Drosten is one of the few virologists who fully understand epidemics, both the molecular biological side and the clinical aspects and the educational work.\nHe has learned from the Sars crisis, says Drosten, that in addition to the transparent dissemination of scientific data, open communication with the population is essential.\" Knowledge of the disease alone in Hong Kong at the time was sufficient to get patients to see a doctor sooner.\"If the situation escalates as it does in Wuhan, then\"any drastic message is useful\". Because only then would people change their behaviour: avoid the accumulation of people and maintain the necessary social distance.\nSpreading his knowledge is now eating up much of Christian Drosten's time. Which is not entirely safe for him. I'm not sure if being a scientist makes up for that,\"he says,\"you have to be careful not to become a television professor.\"\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires\nYeah. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from person to person\nYeah. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite.

        "news_content_translate_en": "On a cruise ship under quarantine in front of Japan 41 more passengers have contracted the Coronavirus. The Japanese authorities reported that the number of infected passengers had increased to 61. Earlier on, 20 patients had been taken off the Diamond Princess.\nAccording to the German Embassy in Tokyo, ten persons of German nationality are among the total of about 3.700 passengers and crew members of the cruise ship. According to the embassy, however, the Germans on board had not been infected, and they were doing well under the circumstances, the embassy said.\nThe Japanese authorities have the ship until 19th. In February, the virus was quarantined to prevent further spread on the mainland. In addition, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that Japan would refuse entry to foreign passengers of another cruise ship with the aim of Japan. The reason for this was a suspicious case on board the Westerdam, which was on its way from Hong Kong to Okinawa. The new regulation will enter into force on Friday. Thousands of passengers and crew members were also isolated on another cruise ship anchored outside Hong Kong called World Dream.\nMost cases of Coronavirus occur in China. There the number of deaths increased to 636 until Friday, and more than 31.000 people with respiratory disease have become infected worldwide.\nPolitically sensitive to the Chinese government is the death of Doctor Li Wenliang, announced on Thursday. Li had warned early of the outbreak of the new virus. The death of the 34-year-old ophthalmologist, who died of lung disease himself on Thursday evening, has caused great sympathy throughout the country.\nYeah. With the agreement of the Party's Central Committee, the State Supervisory Commission sent an investigation team to Wuhan, as the authority announced on Friday.\nHis death symbolizes for many Chinese the consequences of inaction or slow reaction of the authorities to the outbreak. The investigation is about questions of the people about this incident, he said. Li Wenliang was in his 30s. In December, in an online discussion group of doctors and students, citing a growing number of mysterious viral outbreaks in Wuhan, warned of a recurrence of the Sars virus, which led 17-year ago to the pandemic of 8.000 infected and 774 dead.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, every third person has died of it.\nYeah. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment must be\nYeah. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nEight participants in the chat group were then summoned and warned by the police about the spread of \"rumors\". They also had to sign that they were not revealing anything more about the outbreak. A few days later, the doctor infected himself with a patient.\nThe number of new infections with the Coronavirus in China seems to have stabilised slightly, but remains very high. From Thursday to Friday, authorities reported more than 3.140 new cases, increasing the total number of confirmed diseases in China to 31.161. It was the second day in a row that the reported infections did not exceed those of the previous day. Within one day, however, 73 patients died again from the new type of lung disease, as many as the day before. So far there have been 636 Coronavirus deaths in China.\nWhether a further trend in infections can already be identified with the new figures is open, as statistics can also fluctuate with the number of ongoing investigations. In addition, more than 26.000 suspect cases are still registered. The course of the epidemic is difficult to predict from the point of view of the World Health Organisation. Outside the particularly affected areas in Central China, the situation in China seems to be relatively stable at the moment, said WHO expert Michael Ryan in Geneva\nYeah.\nA newborn in the city of Wuhan, the starting point of the virus, was found only 36 hours after birth. These are the most recent known patients.\n\"The baby was separated from its mother immediately after birth and fed artificially. There was no close contact with the parents, yet he was diagnosed with the disease,\"said Zeng Lingkong, director of neonatal diseases at Wuhan Children's Hospital, Chinese TV. Other sick mothers would have had children who responded negatively to tests, Zeng said. It is therefore not clear whether the virus can be transmitted in the uterus.\nOn the edge of the most heavily affected Chinese city of Wuhan, construction workers have now completed the second fastest-built hospital. In both hospitals, 2.500 beds are available for Corona patients. Patients with mild symptoms were transferred to temporary hospital camps in sports arenas, exhibition halls and other public places.\nThere was a 13-year-old in Germany the day before. Fall. Eleven of them are related to the Bavarian company Webasto, where employees had contracted infection from a colleague from China. Two returnees from China were also tested positively. The most recent viral findings came from the 38-year-old wife of one of the patients from Bavaria, as reported by the Bavarian Ministry of Health. Two of the couple's children were also infected. In the third child, a baby, the virus has not yet been detected.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new Coronavirus from China has now also arrived in Germany. The Bavarian health authorities confirmed the first four cases in the Federal Republic on Tuesday.\nAt first the new lung disease had been detected in a 33-year-old man from Landsberg am Lech district. He was infected in his company in a suburb of Munich with a colleague from China. On Tuesday evening, the Bavarian Ministry of Health announced that three more people were infected with the new Coronavirus. \"These patients are also employees of Starnberg County,\" he continued.\nThe four persons concerned were admitted stationary at the Munich clinic Schwabing, where they were medically monitored and isolated, as the Ministry reported. \"Some other contact persons are currently being tested for an infection with the Coronavirus as well.\" Bayern's Minister of Health Melanie Huml (CSU) said, \"The company's total number of 40 employees who are eligible as close contacts has been identified. The people concerned should be tested on Wednesday as a precautionary measure.\"Then the Ministry also wants to inform the press about the current situation.\nAccording to information from the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), the 33-year-old had contracted an infection with a colleague from China who had received training last week on the Webasto car supplier in the Gautinger district of Stockdorf in the Upper Bavarian district of Starnberg. The woman didn't have her infection until 23rd. January on the return flight to China.\nThe new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV can cause a lung disease in which more than 100 people have already died in the main country of China, most of which were elderly patients with severe pre-existing diseases.\nYeah. The total number of known diseases worldwide has now increased to more than 4500, with at least 106 people dying of lung disease in China.\nThe first Coronavirus patient had tested positive for the virus on Monday and had gone back to work. \"He is quite well, he was still working yesterday morning,\" LGL President Andreas Zapf said. \"He is fever-free and has no respiratory symptoms at the moment,\" added Chief Medical Officer Clemens Wendtner of Schwabing Clinic. The man is in an isolation room, there was no danger to other patients.\nAccording to LGL data, the people who had contact with the Chinese and the first sick German Webasto employee are under observation and are urged not to leave their home. According to the Ministry of Health, his child goes to a crib in Landsberg am Lech district. This too is now under observation, LGL President Zapf said. The family status of the three other patients was not known at first. The head of the Infectiology Task Force, Martin Hoch, stressed: \"The number can still rise.\"\nThe new virus 2019-nCoV was originally believed to originate from a market in the Chinese millionaire city of Wuhan, where wild animals traded there probably jumped to humans. According to current experts, the new type of lung disease appears to be mild in most cases, possibly even without symptoms.\nTransmission before the first symptoms are considered very rare. Thus, the first confirmed case of Coronavirus in Germany may also provide new insights into the pathways of infection of lung disease. Because the man was infected with the Chinese woman after initial knowledge, although at the time she showed no symptoms of the disease.\nThe authorities now want to gradually introduce further measures in Bavaria\nYeah. An official hotline of the Bavarian authorities was established, and some health insurance companies did so. Passengers at Munich Airport are required to see a doctor if they suspect an infection with the new Coronavirus, according to the information provided by the National Office with posters in three languages. Further escalation stages of the alert plan are possible: Currently, together with the federation, it is being discussed \"whether it might be useful to measure fever at airports,\" said Minister Huml. In view of the Coronavirus outbreak this year, the world's largest toy fair in Nuremberg is expecting fewer visitors from China.\nThere is no reason to panic, said Huml, as well as her colleague, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU). The case shows \"that we are well prepared,\" he said. The risk to human health in Germany remains low, according to the Robert Koch Institute.\nDespite this, respiratory masks were sold out in individual pharmacies in Bavaria. He has heard this from companies in Lower Franconia and Munich, a spokesman for the Bavarian Pharmaceutical Association of the German Press Agency said.\nThe management of Webasto has cleared the staff at Stockdorfer Central for this week whether they want to come to the office or rather work at home. Webasto is a major supplier for the automotive industry with 13,400 employees and a turnover of 3,4 billion euro. The company had previously cancelled all business trips to China for the next two weeks. BMW, Audi and Siemens also stated that only strictly necessary business trips to China will take place.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "来自中国的新型冠状病毒目前也已抵达德国。巴伐利亚州卫生当局周二证实了联邦共和国的前四例病例。\n起初，在兰兹贝格-阿姆-莱赫区的一名33岁男子身上发现了新的肺病。他与一位来自中国的同事在慕尼黑郊区的公司感染了病毒。星期二晚上，巴伐利亚州卫生部宣布又有三人感染了这种新型冠状病毒。“这些病人也是斯坦伯格县的雇员，”他继续说。\n据德国卫生部报道，这4名涉案人员在慕尼黑施瓦宾诊所（Munich clinic Schwabing）被收治时是静止不动的，他们在那里接受了医学监测和隔离。拜仁卫生部长梅兰妮·休姆（Melanie Huml）说：“目前，其他一些接触者也在接受冠状病毒感染检测，拜仁共有40名员工符合密切接触的条件。作为预防措施，有关人员应该在周三接受检测。”然后，卫生部还想向新闻界通报目前的情况。\n根据来自巴伐利亚州国家卫生和食品安全办公室（LGL）的信息，这位33岁的年轻人与一位中国同事感染了病毒，他上周在斯塔恩伯格上巴伐利亚州斯托克多夫的高廷格区接受了Webasto汽车供应商的培训。这名妇女直到23日才感染。一月份返回中国的航班。\n2019年新型冠状病毒nCoV可导致中国主要国家已有100多人死亡的肺病，其中大部分是患有严重既往疾病的老年患者。\n是 啊。目前，全球已知疾病总数已增至4500多种，中国至少有106人死于肺病。\n第一个冠状病毒病人在星期一检测出病毒阳性，现在已经回去工作了。LGL总裁扎普夫（Andreas Zapf）说：“他很好，昨天早上还在工作。”。施瓦宾诊所的首席医疗官克莱门斯·温特纳补充说：“他目前没有发烧，也没有呼吸系统症状。”。这个人在隔离室里，对其他病人没有危险。\n根据LGL的数据，与中国人和第一个生病的德国Webasto员工有过接触的人正在接受观察，并被敦促不要离开他们的家。根据卫生部的说法，他的孩子去了兰茨贝格阿姆莱赫区的一个婴儿床。LGL总裁扎普夫说，这也在观察之中。其他三名患者的家庭状况一开始并不清楚。传染病专责小组的负责人马丁霍克强调说：“这个数字还会上升。”\n2019年新病毒nCoV最初被认为来自中国百万富翁城市武汉的一个市场，那里交易的野生动物可能跳到了人类身上。据目前的专家称，这种新型肺病在大多数情况下似乎是轻微的，甚至可能没有症状。\n在第一症状出现之前传播被认为是非常罕见的。因此，德国首例冠状病毒确诊病例也可能为肺部疾病的感染途径提供新的见解。因为这名男子是在初步了解中国女子感染后，虽然当时她没有出现疾病症状。\n当局现在希望在巴伐利亚逐步采取进一步措施\n是 啊。巴伐利亚当局开通了官方热线，一些健康保险公司也开通了热线。根据国家办公室提供的信息，慕尼黑机场的乘客如果怀疑感染了新的冠状病毒，必须去看医生。预警计划的进一步升级阶段是可能的：目前，正在与联邦一起讨论“在机场测量发烧是否有用”，休姆部长说。鉴于今年冠状病毒的爆发，纽伦堡世界最大的玩具展预计来自中国的游客将减少。\n休姆和她的同事、联邦卫生部长延斯•斯潘（Jens Spahn）说，没有理由恐慌。他说，这起案件表明“我们准备充分”。据罗伯特·科赫研究所称，德国的人类健康风险仍然很低。\n尽管如此，巴伐利亚州的个别药店的呼吸面罩还是卖光了。德国新闻机构巴伐利亚制药协会的发言人说，他已经从下弗朗索尼亚和慕尼黑的公司那里听到了这一消息。\n本周，Webasto的管理层已经让Stockdorfer Central的员工清楚了，他们是来办公室还是在家工作。伟巴斯特是汽车行业的主要供应商，拥有13400名员工和34亿欧元的营业额。此前，该公司已取消了未来两周所有赴中国的商务旅行。宝马、奥迪和西门子也表示，只会进行严格必要的中国商务旅行。（dpa）\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "For most people in the Upper Bavarian small town of Gauting, the Chinese million metropolis of Wuhan is miles away. But this changes rapidly when an employee of a local car supplier discovers the new Coronavirus.\nIt's the first case in Germany. Just a few hours later, webasto's headquarters in the 4000-inhabitant district of Stockdorf Camerateams are swarming, and local pharmacies have a run on oral protection masks and disinfectants on Tuesday. Three other cases relating to the first are already known on Tuesday evening.\nThese, too, are Webasto employees and, like about 1000-others, worked in the Starnberg district headquarters, where the first person was employed, a spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health in Munich and the company reported on Tuesday evening. \"It has been decided that the three new patients at the Munich clinic Schwabing will also be admitted stationary and will be medically monitored and isolated there,\" the ministry continues. \"Some other contact persons are currently being tested for an infection with the Coronavirus.\" Further information should follow on Wednesday. Webasto temporarily closes the Stockdorf site until Sunday.\nThe first confirmed cases in Germany leave those responsible reeling. \"Our night was relatively short,\" says the President of the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), Andreas Zapf, on Tuesday. At 20.30 o'clock on Monday evening he is informed that the Bayer has tested positive for the corona virus. The wires have been burning ever since. Shortly before midnight the Bavarian Ministry of Health informs the public, a few hours later the Ministry's lobby bursts from all corners\nYeah.\nAt the press conference, experts are mapping the path that the virus, with its provisional name 2019-nCoV, has taken on its way to Germany: On the 16th. In January, a Chinese employee of Webasto receives a visit from her parents from the region of Wuhan particularly affected by the new Coronavirus in Shanghai. Three days later, she makes her way to the headquarters of her company in Germany. I have 21. In January, she participates in a training course in the Gautinger district of Stockdorf. According to her, she was still doing well.\nOnly on her return to China on the 23rd. In January, the woman feels flu, goes home to a doctor and is tested positive for the corona virus. Monday, the 27th. In January, the company management in Germany learns about the finding. It acts quickly and informs colleagues. An employee who has participated in the training together with the woman and worked in a small group can be tested. At the weekend, Zapf said he felt \"flu-like, more like a severe bronchitis\".\nAnd in fact, the test is positive. The family father comes immediately to the Schwabing Clinic, is closely supervised by the doctors in an isolation room with a lock and und er pressure, and is now fit again. A \"healer\" at the isolation station- this unusual situation makes the treating chief physician Clemens Wendtner joke: \"He is awake, approachable and I would also venture the statement that he is out of danger of life.\" The patient has neither fever nor cough, he is \"doing very well\".\nHowever, the man must remain in isolation for an indefinite period of time. \"We cannot yet say with certainty how long the virus of the sick person, if he is healthy, will continue to be transmitted,\" explains Zapf. The virus is so new that the doctors don't know so many things.\nYeah. Relatively rare is such a transmission: so far only three other cases have been known worldwide in which one person has contracted an infection outside China with another, which occurred in Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan. Most people also had symptoms when they infected others.\nMore suspicious cases are reported in Germany during the day. While the laboratories in the other federal states are still examining the samples, the authorities in the free state are concentrating on around 40 people with whom the German patient and the Chinese woman had closer contact. Among them are not only colleagues, but also the husband's family; they are to stay at home during the incubation period from up to 14 days. In the view, those responsible also have a nursery in Landsberg am Lech district, which visits the patient's little child. \"We do not see any reason to close the crypt at the moment,\" a spokesman for the Land Council emphasises. \"Neither the patient's wife nor child have been affected so far.\"\nIn the case of the company concerned, the employees go in and out on Tuesday- the decision on the temporary closure takes place only in the evening after the three other cases become known. Outside, the Webasto car supplier operates normally before, even if one or other of them reaches the entrance for their own hand disinfection. Most employees don't want to comment on the case. \"No comment,\" it is said again and again. One employee says that there is \"normal operation\". However, there is also uncertainty. Another reported that it was very quiet, apparently many had actually stayed at home.\nThe pharmacies in Gauting and throughout the Worm Valley are experiencing a storm. Demands are made for disinfectants, but above all for respiratory protection.\nYeah. However, such masks make no sense, as the chairman of the German Society of Infectiology, Bernd Salzberger of the University Hospital Regensburg, stresses. The so-called surgical facial masks were not designed to protect against infections, but only to prevent infectious drops from the surgeon's breathing air from entering the surgical wound. \"But protection against an infection from the outside is very, very bad,\" Salzberger explains. Martin Hoch, head of the LGL Task Force on Infectiology, also emphasises that normal hand hygiene and cough labels are sufficient.\nIn its special unit there is a very specific alarm plan with several escalation stages for cases such as the current one. Step one: doctors across the country are informed and sensitised. This took place last week. With the first confirmed case, another escalation stage has been reached: for example, information screens are now being run at the airport, including in Chinese. Stage three is when controllers take a close look at the incoming passengers and measure the temperature by a distance thermometer.\nSuch measures are also discussed by the national health ministers. Subsequently, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) informs the Tower of the state of health of passengers on flights from China prior to landing at German airports. Travellers from China should also fill out forms on how to reach them in the next thirty days so that contact persons can be identified in case of infection.\nIn the main country of China, more than 100 people have already died of the infection, most of which were elderly patients with severe pre-conditions. The total number of known diseases worldwide has now increased to more than 4500\nYeah.\nMany countries are bringing their citizens back from Wuhan, such as the UK, Belgium, Japan, South Korea, France and the USA. The Federal Government is also preparing an evacuation flight to fly volunteer Germans out of Wuhan.\nWith all due caution, those responsible keep making it clear:'In our opinion, the risk to human health in Germany remains low', as Minister of Health Spahn emphasises on Tuesday. \"There is no need for excessive concern.\"\nChief physician Wendtner also considers a completely different danger much greater. \"In my view, this case would be enough reason to put the prevention of influenza back in the foreground.\" Because even if in the next few weeks more people in Germany were to get the Coronavirus, the flu killed around 25.000 patients nationwide in the season 2017/2018.

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Workers began trickling back to offices and factories around China on Monday as the government eased some restrictions on working during a coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 900 people, most on the mainland.\nSunday’s death toll of 97 was the largest in a single day since the outbreak was first detected in December and linked to a market selling animals in Hubei province’s capital, Wuhan.\nStocks and oil fell while safe-haven gold rose as the death toll from the outbreak surpassed that of another coronavirus, which brought a global epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003, raising alarm bells about its severity.\nA team of experts headed by the World Health Organization (WHO) was flying into Beijing on Monday to help assess the outbreak.\nThe epidemic has caused huge disruptions in China with usually teeming cities becoming virtual ghost towns during the past two weeks as Communist Party rulers ordered virtual lockdowns, canceled flights and closed factories and schools.\nAuthorities told businesses to add up to 10 extra days onto Lunar New Year holidays that had been due to finish at the end of January.\nEven on Monday, a large number of workplaces will remain closed and many white-collar workers were working from home.\nOn one of the usually busiest subway lines in Beijing, trains were largely empty. The few commuters seen during peak-hour morning traffic were all wearing masks.\nJin Yang, who works for a department under China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange, rode a bicycle to work instead of public transport. Staff were told to wear masks, avoid face-to-face meetings and the canteen was closed, he said.\nAnother employee surnamed Chen said the insurance company he worked for forbid people from taking public transport.\n“My home is in Huairou district which is far from downtown,” he said\n. “I usually take subways but this morning it cost me 200 yuan one way by cab.”\nHubei, the province hit hardest by the outbreak, remains in virtual lockdown, with its train stations and airports shut and its roads sealed off.\nSome restrictions on people entering and leaving residential compounds are in place in many other cities across China, and schools in many regions will be shut until the end of February.\nAcross mainland China, there were 3,062 new confirmed infections on Sunday, bringing the total number to 40,171, according to the National Health Commission (NHC), with 908 dead.\n“Markets will be sensitive to coronavirus news as factories and ports in China reopen. The extent to which that is achievable will indicate the level of ongoing disruption,” ANZ economists wrote in a note.\nThe extended closure of factories in the world’s second-largest economy has raised concerns for global supply chains.\nChina’s central bank has taken a raft of steps to support the economy, including reducing interest rates and flushing the market with liquidity. From Monday, it will provide special funds for banks to re-lend to businesses combating the virus.\nTaiwan’s Foxconn has received Chinese government approval to resume production at a key plant in the north China city of Zhengzhou, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Monday.\nTesla, Daimler and Ford Motor are among carmakers that have said that they will restart production at their factories on Monday. Gaming giant Tencent Holdings said it had asked staff to continue working from home until Feb. 21.\nSamsung Electronics resumed production at its home appliance factory in China on Monday, while it continues to run its chip factory in China, a spokeswoman said.\nKia Motors is suspending production at its three car plants in South Korea on Monday for at least a day due to a shortage of auto parts from China related to the coronavirus outbreak, a company official said\n.\nThe WHO declared the outbreak a global emergency on Jan. 30, days after the Chinese central government imposed a lockdown on 60 million people in Hubei province.\nThe WHO took nearly two weeks to get the government’s green light on the composition of its advance team of experts, which left Geneva on Sunday.\nOver the weekend, an American hospitalized in the central city of Wuhan became the first confirmed non-Chinese victim of the disease.

On Monday, stocks in the world's second largest economy got mauled when re-opening after an extended Lunar New Year holiday with China's blue-chip index <.CSI300> tumbling nearly 8% and the Shanghai Composite losing $420 billion of its value. China's central bank said on Monday it will inject 1.2 trillion yuan ($174 billion) worth of liquidity into the markets via reverse repo operations. Eyes will be on policy makers to see what monetary - or other - support they might stump up.  \n The virus's progression has been likened to a schlock science fiction movie, replete with conspiracy theories around symptomless transmission and super-spreaders. Some 60 million people at the center of the outbreak are living under virtual lockdown. A shock to China's economy this quarter, which then reverberates through global supply chains, is a foregone conclusion. It's just that no one can yet say how deep.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: China's GDP and markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6912/6843/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n  \n 2/THE VIRUS AND THE WORLD  \n The coronavirus' repercussions are being felt far and wide, well beyond its starting point in China's Hubei province. Countries reliant on Chinese demand have seen steep drops in their currencies, with the Australian dollar down around 5% in January, its worst month since 2016. The Thai and Korean currencies, exposed to China via tourism and goods exports respectively, are also taking a battering.  \n Growth forecast downgrades for China, the world's No\n. 2 economy, are coming thick and fast, meaning estimates for other countries are being reworked too. Tellingly, 'Dr' Copper, the best-known gauge of economic health, is down 10% in little more than a week, and oil suffered a fourth week of losses. World stocks have lost $1.2 trillion over the past two weeks and have come under fresh pressure again at the start of the week. Depending on how the virus spreads from now, there could be more pain to come.  \n Selling may focus in particular on travel and leisure, with a European index of these sectors skidding to the lowest since October last week. The beneficiaries? The usual safe-haven plays: gold, for instance, has enjoyed its best month in five.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Airline and hotel stocks slide on Coronavirus outbreak - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1644/1619/stocks.png)  \n  \n 3/ARE EURO ZONE BANKS TURNING A CORNER?  \n Blowout performances by Wall Street banks, and bumper Q4 earnings from the Spanish lender Santander, have fed hopes of a strong season for euro zone banks, a raft of which will post results in coming days. How heavyweights such as BNP Paribas, Intesa and ING fared in the last quarter of 2019 will shed more light on how they are riding the wave of negative rates.  \n Troubled Deutsche Bank reported a major loss due to one-offs, but shares rose nonetheless as investors turned their focus on the bank's turnaround potential. With higher interest rates still far off, banks are finding it challenging to grow. But after 20 straight months of downgrades, earnings estimates have started to stabilize.  \n The coronavirus scare, however, threatens to strangle Europe's economic recovery and therefore any banking revival. An index of bank shares has fallen more than 5% so far this year, underperforming the broader euro benchmark.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Banks' earnings - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1604/1579/Bank%20earnings%20revisions\n.png)  \n  \n 4/ WORK AND PAY  \n Friday's non-farm payroll data will show how the U.S. economy fared in the first month of the new decade. The report is expected to show a pickup from December, with a Reuters poll forecasting 156,000 were added, from 145,000 the month before. The previous decade hit a number of milestones. December's report was the 111th monthly scorecard in a row to show employment gains, while the 3.5% unemployment rate matched a low from half a century ago and is roughly a third of the level at the start of the decade. Worries of a trade-war-induced slowdown have faded since the Federal Reserve delivered three rate cuts in 2019. Recent data has largely shown the U.S. economy continuing to expand at a moderate pace, and the Fed has signaled that its monetary policy stance is unlikely to change this year.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: U.S. Unemployment vs S&P index - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1610/1585/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 5/RETURN OF VOLMAGEDDON  \n When a slight U.S. inflation uptick pushed stock markets lower on Feb. 5 two years ago, few expected it to turn into one of the biggest Wall Street shake-ups in recent years. That episode -- \"Volmageddon\" -- saw the VIX equity volatility gauge triple overnight to 50%, wiping out hordes of small punters who had piled into so-called inverse-vol investments.  \n These strategies, peddled via exchange-traded products and designed to profit from extended spells of market calm, yielded rich pickings as long as volatility stayed low. But as the VIX exploded higher, vehicles such as the ProShares Short VIX ETF tumbled over 80 percent in a day.  \n As we were reminded two years ago, volatility can spike spectacularly in quiet markets. As it happens, the coronavirus has sent the VIX to three-month highs and ProShares ETF, which had climbed back to the highest level reached since Volmageddon, has fallen again. But volatility gauges for bonds and currencies remain well below historic averages\n. Investors might be wise to brace for reversals.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: euro-dollar vol - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1650/1625/vol.png) REUTERS\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG — Chinese health officials on Friday (Feb 7) sought to assuage a jittery public over the strength of the novel coronavirus which has sickened more than 31,200 people across the country. \n Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Dr Wang Guoqiang, an infectious disease expert at Peking University No 1 Hospital, said that preliminary data about people who had recovered after being infected was promising. \n Based on a small sample of discharged patients from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, Dr Wang said that about 6 per cent had recovered after being in a serious condition, while less than one per cent had recovered after being classed as in critical condition. \n “This shows that cases in serious and critical conditions can be treated and discharged from hospital after receiving proactive treatment, and that has given us great confidence,” he said. \n “We now have expert teams supporting Wuhan, especially those who have been transferred from intensive care units. \n “I think this will greatly reduce the mortality of patients in critical condition and improve the recovery rate,” he said. \n Ms Guo Yanhong, a senior inspector with the National Health Commission, said at the briefing that the addition of “medical shelters” in Wuhan — which will provide 4,600 beds once completed — would greatly help in the treatment of patients with mild symptoms, and prevent them from developing complications and aggravating their illness. \n “Our capacity to treat patients is significantly boosted by these medical shelters… enabling us to lower infections,” she said. \n Dr Wang said the new shelters would “enable us to segregate the patients, ensure they are properly isolated and hence preventing infection, and also allow us to better identify patients who may have the risk of becoming critically ill”\n. \n The new coronavirus, which was first reported in Wuhan in December, has killed 638 people — all but two of them in mainland China — and sickened more than 31,500 people globally. As of Friday, more than 1,600 people had recovered after being infected. \n Dr Hitoshi Oshitani, a virology professor from Tohoku University in Japan, said it was promising that some critically ill patients had recovered. \n “[Mortality] is definitely much lower than Sars. The true figure may be even lower. But it is also definitely higher than seasonal influenza,” he said referring to severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed about 800 people around the world in 2002-03. \n But Dr Oshitani called on China to make more real-time data available. \n “For example, we want to know what is happening in major cities such as Chongqing. This is critically important in predicting what is going to happen in other cities such as Tokyo,” he said. \n As well as figures for confirmed cases, those in serious condition and discharged, Dr Oshitani said it would be useful to have data on how many patients had been infected because of local transmission or were imported cases from Wuhan as that would hold the key to determining whether the spread of the virus was controllable. \n “If most of them are still imported cases from Wuhan, they may be able to control the situation. If there is a widespread local transmission, it is totally different,” he said. \n The most recent figures, released on Tuesday, showed that about 60 per cent of Chongqing’s cases were imported and 40 per cent were locally transmitted. \n But locally transmitted cases had begun to overtake imported cases, the local health commission said. \n Dr Gregory Gray, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at Duke University in the United States, said that without population-based studies, metrics such as pathogenicity, the percentage of those who develop severe disease among the infected, and mortality may not be precise\n. \n “I think many epidemiologists suspect the estimates for 2019-nCoV disease severity are a bit exaggerated,” he said, using the official name of the virus. \n “Metrics like pathogenicity and mortality are falsely elevated because infected people with few or no symptoms are not being counted in the denominators.” \n But Dr Gray also acknowledged that there were people in China suspected of contracting the coronavirus but who had not been tested. They would not be counted in the statistics, which further complicated the assessment of the disease, he said. SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n",

In total, only 27 of the 41 cases had exposure to the marketplace. \n \"Judging from the whole situation, the seafood market may not be the only source.

They include Australia, India, Indonesia, Singapore, New Zealand, Russia and North Korea, and many countries have evacuated or are attempting to evacuate their citizens from Hubei province at the epidemic's epicentre. \n \"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems\" than China's, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a tweet. \"I am declaring a public health emergency of international concern… not because of what is happening in China, but because of what is happening in other countries.\" \n The new coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, can lead to severe and often deadly pneumonia. Even as the number of infections and deaths rapidly mounted in Hubei's capital Wuhan and cases appeared in a growing number of other countries, the WHO took a deliberate approach to evaluating the danger. \n The agency's emergency committee, in meetings on Jan 22-23, initially decided not to designate it a global crisis pending collection of more data. A week later, the WHO declared the coronavirus the first global public health emergency originating in China. Such a designation did not apply to even the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic 17 years ago. \n A look at how the organisation reached its decision shows some of the inner workings of the global system for preventing and managing the spread of dangerous new diseases\n. \n The system relies on the rapid sharing of information among national health systems and the global public health organisation. Although some Chinese officials have drawn criticism internally and abroad for initially trying to downplay the crisis, the WHO's Dr Tedros maintains China was quick to share information, enhancing the global response. \n \"In many ways, China is setting a new standard for outbreak response,\" Dr Tedros said at a press conference. \"We would have seen many more cases outside China by now, and probably deaths, if not for the government's efforts.\" \n Data from China on the pathogen allowed Japan, South Korea and Thailand to diagnose similar cases quickly, he said. For example, a Chinese laboratory warned the German government of an infected person returning to Germany. \n Dr Tedros, an Ethiopian public health expert, arrived on Jan 27 in Beijing to meet Chinese officials. During his visit, President Xi Jinping called on the country to be transparent in working with the rest of the world and agreed to allow the WHO to send a group of international experts into the country to study the new strain of coronavirus alongside Chinese counterparts. \n Those data-gathering steps helped fill the information gap that kept the WHO's emergency panel from issuing its global warning sooner. \n Before the Jan 22-23 meetings, the lack of information on the virulence, infectiousness, severity and clinical symptoms of the coronavirus made reaching a consensus difficult, WHO emergency committee member John Mackenzie told media company Caixin. \n The global organisation had evidence of transmission of the virus within a household, but that is not unusual for a respiratory disease. The experts were looking for \"third-or fourth-generation infections\", referring to how many times a disease has been passed on, an indication of virulence. That evidence came quickly, laying the groundwork for the emergency committee to issue its global warning\n. \n Some argue that compared with the 2003 Sars crisis, the Chinese government has been much more transparent about the current coronavirus. \n \"Before we start pointing the finger at China, we need to recognise there are genuine sensitivities around sharing data around new diseases,\" said Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO's health emergencies programme who accompanied Dr Tedros to Beijing. \"I believe in this case the countries that have been affected, including China, have been remarkably transparent.\" \n According to US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, China's compliance with international health regulations and uploading of the genetic sequence of the virus enabled the Americans to develop a test kit to screen for infections. \n Under the WHO-administered International Health Regulations, a global public health emergency applies to \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\". \n Since 2007, the WHO has declared public health emergencies in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the 2014 setbacks in global polio eradication efforts, the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, the 2016 Zika virus outbreak and the 2018-2019 Kivu Ebola epidemic. \n The organisation's emergency committee, which makes the call, is made up of epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease experts. Among them, at least one expert comes from the country where the epidemic began. \n The panel can also make recommendations to foreign governments on measures such as travel or trade restrictions. \n Even during serious crises, the WHO is conservative in its pronouncements. Through July last year, the Kivu Ebola epidemic killed 1,500 and infected more than 2,300 after appearing in the Democratic Republic of Congo in August 2018 and spread to nearby countries\n. The disease was not declared an international public health emergency until the WHO's fourth emergency committee meeting last July. \n Three factors weighed on the current WHO decision, according to Professor Didier Houssin, chairman of the WHO emergency committee. They were the rising number of cases in China, the growing number of countries with confirmed infections and the spread of questionable measures by some nations involving travellers. \n While the emergency committee does not encourage travel or trade restrictions, it acknowledges that such steps can be useful at times, such as when response capabilities are limited or when there is a large likelihood of infection among vulnerable groups. \n Under the International Health Regulations, countries are required to report travel restrictions to the WHO, and they are barred from taking steps that encourage discrimination. \n After news broke of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, many countries imposed increasingly stringent measures. In addition to posting travel warnings and tightening border controls, several counties implemented preliminary screening measures using their own public health organisations to diagnose those who may have come into contact with the virus even before they showed symptoms. \n The United States reacted especially quickly. On Jan 17, four days after Thailand reported its first case, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it would screen passengers arriving from Wuhan at major airports in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. At the time, the US had not reported any cases of the disease. After it did so, the country expanded screenings of Chinese passengers to 20 airports while also advising against all travel to China\n. \n Last Friday, the US declared the coronavirus epidemic a public health emergency and temporarily closed its borders to foreign nationals who had travelled to China in the previous two weeks and are not immediate family members of US citizens or permanent residents. The government also imposed mandatory two-week quarantines for those who were in China's Hubei province during that time span. \n As she confirmed Europe's first case of the coronavirus on Jan 24, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn promised total transparency and daily updates to combat misinformation. She said sharing epidemic information with the public was the best barrier to its spread. \n Even though China shared the virus' genome sequence on Jan 11, researchers do not yet have a full grasp of its characteristics and routes of transmission, according to the WHO. \n Because developing a vaccine or treatment requires significant time and resources, all countries - including China and the US - should pool their efforts, said Dr Richard Hatchett, chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), an international epidemiology group. \n Cepi, made up of public and private entities, said on Jan 23 that it was funding research into three separate efforts to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus with the aim of shortening development time to several months. \n The US National Institutes of Health started research on vaccines after receiving the virus' genetic sequencing, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Jan 20. He cautioned that the development process can last months or years, so controlling the epidemic will require \"traditional\" public health measures. \n So long as there is no vaccine, the only available measures for slowing the spread of the disease are quarantine, delaying resumption of work and schools and restricting travel, Dr Hatchett said last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland\n. He cautioned that the cost of these measures is high and difficult to sustain. \n From studying non-medical interventions in the 1980s, the US found that disease prevention is more effective when a city implements various interventions during the onset of an outbreak, Dr Hatchett said. \n As a US government public health official in 2005, Dr Hatchet helped draft the country's epidemic response plan in the light of the outbreak of the H5N1 influenza. \n • Xu Heqian, Wu Hongyuran, Qu Yunxu, Fu Lin, Zhang Qi, Chen Lixiong and Li Xin contributed to this article. \n • This article was first published by Caixin Global.\n",

The virus does not only affect people with underlying health problems and, even without symptoms, people may be carriers of the virus.\nIn one of the investigations, both presented in Lancet magazine, the clinical data of the first 41 patients admitted with infection in the central city of Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have originated were analyzed. The average age of the patients was around the 49s.\nPatients presented a wide range of symptoms, many of which were similar to those found in infected with Acute Grave Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), whose global outbreak in 2002-2003 also began in China. They all developed pneumonia and most of them started complaining of fever and coughing. Fatigue, headaches and diarrhea were rarer symptoms.\nDistinct aspects were also found. \"While sharing some symptoms similar to SARS (e.g. fever, dry cough, shortness of breath), there are some important differences, such as the absence of symptoms of the upper respiratory tract\", explained the main author of the study, Bin Cao, from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and the University of Capital Medicine, China.\nSome of the fatal cases caused by the virus occurred among people with underlying diseases such as diabetes, liver disease and hypertension, but one important discovery was that most early 41 patients were healthy.\nThe second article focused on a family that had pneumonia in Shenzhen. Five members had been in Wuhan and had the virus, just like another family member, who had not traveled.\nYeah.\nSo far, authorities have only confirmed transmission of the virus from person to person between families and in health clinics -situations where people are likely to be in close contact, according to the World Health Organisation. This seems to be the case with the family studied. Yet the health authorities do not know exactly to what extent the virus can be transmitted among people.\nA child infected with the virus has not shown any symptoms, which raises the question of whether people need to show signs of the disease in order to be able to transmit it.\n\"As asymptomatic infection seems possible, control of the epidemic will also depend on patient isolation, screening and quarantine of contacts as soon as possible\", warned Kwok-Yung Yuen of the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, which led this research.\nThe authors of both studies observed several limitations of the study, including the fact that due to the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess the risk factors for the severity and mortality of the disease and require higher studies in an outpatient and community environment to confirm the whole clinical spectrum of the disease.\nChina announced this Friday the death of a person due to the coronavirus near the Russian border- the second outside the epicenter of the outbreak- increasing to 26 the number of fatalities.

She was asymptomatic when she boarded the flight. \n \"Upon arrival at Changi Airport, she was found to have a fever during medical screening, and was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID),\" MOH said. \n The woman then tested positive for Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 31 at about 11pm. She is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. \n The 18th case is a 31-year-old female Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. \n She tested positive for infection on Feb 1 at about 2pm and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. \n MOH said that it has initiated epidemiological investigations and contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the cases. \n In an update on the 16th confirmed case, which was announced on Jan 31, MOH said the 38-year-old male Chinese national arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on Jan 22. \n He is currently warded in an isolation room at the Singapore General Hospital. The man reported that he was asymptomatic during his flight to Singapore and subsequently developed symptoms on Jan 23. \n He reported that he had stayed at his home at Nathan Road until Jan 29, when he took a taxi to SGH.

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Repeats Feb 11 story with no changes in text)\nBEIJING, Feb 11 (Reuters) - China’s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country’s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing’s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters. Authorities have also reprimanded tech firms that gave free rein to online speech.\n“Xi Jinping has made it clear that he expects efforts to strengthen ‘the guidance of public opinion’ to be increased,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\n“We’ve already seen around 300 more journalists dispatched to Wuhan and surrounding areas to report on the outbreak. It’s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government’s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.”\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina’s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li’s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to “comment or speculate” on Li’s death, “do not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.”\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n“At the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,” she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for “spreading rumours” on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a “good online atmosphere” amid the country’s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on “harmful information and rumour” related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People’s Daily, “not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.”\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city’s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absence.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humour or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay. One phrase widely shared mocked how many Internet pages and content were now showing “server not found” or “404”.\n“404+404+404+404+404=2020,” said the shared post.

However, some experts called for caution as the death toll in China crossed 1,100.\n“While there continues to be high uncertainty about the rate of spread and timing of the peak of the coronavirus, modelling by epidemiological experts indicates a likely range for the peak between late February and June,” analysts at S&P Global said.\nDealers also took note of comments overnight from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who remained fairly upbeat about the U.S. economy, but warned that the virus-led disruptions in China could spill over globally.\n“One can, in fact, make a bullish case for equities based on any scenario regarding COVID-19,” OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley said.\n“An escalation in its spread causes a pronounced global slowdown, which prompts central banks to cut interest rates aggressively.

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd warned of a drop in revenues at its key e-commerce businesses this quarter as the coronavirus sweeping China hits supply chains and deliveries.\nThe warning from executives came during an earnings call for the quarter ending in December 2019, during which the company beat analyst estimates and brought in record transactions for its annual Singles’ Day shopping event.\nCEO Daniel Zhang said the delayed return to work following the Lunar New Year, due to the virus outbreak which has killed more than 1,350 people in China and infected thousands more, had caused problems for merchants and delays in fulfilling orders.\nHe said food delivery orders had dropped year-on-year due to the number of restaurants that had closed as a result of the outbreak. And while the company has seen a surge in demand for goods from its Hema supermarkets, it has been held back by limited delivery capacity.\nFinance chief Maggie Wu said most of Alibaba’s businesses that rely on the sale of physical goods would likely see a decline in revenues this quarter.\n“We like other businesses are not immune to supply and demand,” she said. “Their recovery and long term success will translate to long term growth for Alibaba Group.”\nDespite the downbeat forecast, Zhang said that as of Monday Alibaba had observed more people in large cities going back to work and logistics networks returning to normal operations.\nHe also said DingTalk, the company’s enterprise chat app, had seen “explosive growth” during the crisis as white collar businesses and schools use it for remote working and online lessons.\n“Alibaba’s earnings for the next couple of quarters are certainly likely to take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak. However, the company’s business is strong enough to withstand the brief downturn, with its cloud computing business set to lead the charge for a more positive outlook,” said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at financial markets platform Investing.com.\nAlibaba usually reports its highest revenue in the December quarter due to its mega Singles’ Day shopping bonanza in November. The company said sales during the 24-hour event hit a record $38.4 billion in 2019.\nThe group primarily generates revenue by selling advertising and promotional services to third-party merchants that list products on its e-commerce sites, Taobao and Tmall.\nThe company said it was supporting the fight against the coronavirus outbreak by ensuring supply of daily necessities and introducing relief measures for its merchants.\nAlibaba affiliate Ant Financial’s MYBank unit has said it will offer 20 billion yuan ($2.9 billion) in loans to companies in China in the wake of the outbreak.\nThe outbreak, which originated in the city of Wuhan, has resulted in companies laying off workers, seeking cheaper funding and struggling to restart production after an extended Lunar New year holiday, as supply chains are disrupted.\nAlibaba is often viewed as a window into the health of China’s consumer economy, which Beijing views as key to continued economic growth.\nThe epidemic is expected to pile more pressure on China’s economy, just as the government had hoped a preliminary deal with the United States would ease a protracted trade war that had weighed on its growth.\nSales in Alibaba’s core commerce business jumped 38% to 141.48 billion yuan in its third quarter ended Dec. 31, while revenue at its cloud computing unit surged 62% to 10.72 billion.\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders rose to 52.31 billion yuan from 33.05 billion.\nExcluding items, the company earned 18.19 yuan per American Depository Share (ADS). Analysts had expected 15.75 yuan per ADS, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\nTotal revenue rose about 38% to 161.46 billion yuan, beating estimates of 159.28 billion yuan.\nU.S.-listed shares of the company were up nearly 1% at $226.30 in premarket trade.\n",

After the city’s borders were closed on Jan. 23 and all incoming and outgoing flights cancelled, other nearby cities in Hubei province also implemented their own policies restricting the movement of people.\nBut not every city or province is facing Wuhan-like restrictions. Citizens cannot leave the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou and a few others in Hubei province, while Shanghai and Beijing have only put movement restrictions in place for some smaller communities such as building blocks or neighbourhoods.\nMany cities have reduced public transport lines and routes, while few have closed intra-city public transport entirely. Altogether, 80.41 million people have been affected by shut bus or metro lines.\nSome communities have instituted curfews or only allow people to exit and enter at particular times. There is even a restriction where only a certain number of people from a household can leave their residence at any one time.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus has hit one of the most populated regions on the planet and thus has led to an unprecedented lockdown on the movement of people.\n",

It was unchanged on the pound at $1.3049 and a tad weaker on the euro at $1.0837.\nThe risk-sensitive Aussie, which is also played as a liquid proxy for the Chinese yuan, was also barely moved at $0.6716.\nThat left the dollar index at 99.093.\nIn commodities, gold inched slightly lower to $1,583.15 an ounce.\nOil futures were mixed with Brent crude down 8 cents at $57.24 and U.S. crude up 4 cents at $52.09.\n",

Sterling was quoted at 83.33 pence per euro, nursing a 0.4% decline on Monday.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson’s Europe adviser David Frost said on Monday Britain would not be threatened into following EU rules to win a free trade agreement with the bloc.\nFrost’s comments contrast with those of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who has called on Britain to guarantee fair competition based on ambitious environmental and labour standards.\nBritain left the EU last month and the two sides will now start negotiating a new relationship from trade to security.\nThe onshore yuan was a tad lower at 6.9859 versus the dollar, unsettled by a decline in Chinese shares after Apple Inc said it will not meet sales targets because the virus epidemic has slowed production and demand in China.\nChina’s Hubei province, considered the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, said new cases of the illness fell slightly to 1,807 on Monday from 1,933 the previous day.\nCurrency traders are cautiously monitoring new data on the virus given uncertainty about the actual number of cases and difficulties in estimating when the epidemic will peak.\nThe yen, which initially gained on safe-haven flows as the outbreak unfolded last month, held steady in a narrow range at 109.74 per dollar.\nThe Australian dollar fell 0.39% to $0.6690 after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s first meeting of the year showed policymakers discussed easing policy.\nThe RBA kept rates unchanged at an all-time low of 0.75% at that meeting, but the minutes showed central bankers are prepared to ease policy further if needed.\nThe New Zealand dollar also fell 0.4% to $0.6411.\nThe antipodean currencies have been buffeted by the virus due to Australia’s and New Zealand’s extensive trade ties with China, with commodities, tourism and education especially vulnerable.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "For the past two weeks China's police have been raiding houses, restaurants and makeshift markets across the country, arresting nearly 700 people for breaking the temporary ban on catching, selling or eating wild animals.\nThe scale of the crackdown, which has netted almost 40,000 animals including squirrels, weasels and boars, suggests that China's taste for eating wildlife and using animal parts for medicinal purposes is not likely to disappear overnight, despite potential links to the new coronavirus.\nTraders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile and other meat told Reuters that they plan to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen.\n\"I'd like to sell once the ban is lifted,\" said Gong Jian, who runs a wildlife store online and operates shops in China's autonomous Inner Mongolia region. \"People like buying wildlife. They buy for themselves to eat or give as presents because it is very presentable and gives you face.\"\nGong said that he was storing crocodile and deer meat in large freezers but would have to kill all the quails he had been breeding as supermarkets were no longer buying his eggs and they cannot be eaten after freezing.\nScientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from bats via pangolins, a small ant-eating mammal whose scales are highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine.\nSome of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to Wuhan's seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety.\nThat may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country's culture and history.\n\"In many people's eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man,\" said Wang Song, a retired researcher of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\nONLINE DEBATE\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,600 people in China, revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. It previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets.\nMany academics, environmentalists and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold.\nOnline debate within China, likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favored a permanent ban.\n\"One bad habit is that we dare to eat anything,\" said one commenter called Sun on a news discussion forum on Chinese website Sina. \"We must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail.\"\nNevertheless, a minority of Chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing the demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in Wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal.\nOne online commenter calling themselves Onlooker Pharaoh said on Chinese news platform Hupu that the risk was worth it: \"Giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke.\"\nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\nThe breeding and trading of wild animals in China is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people.\nAfter the SARS outbreak, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes.\nThese officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $20 billion in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report.\n\"The state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use,\" said Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist for the Humane Society International. \"It insists on China's right to use wildlife resources for development purposes.\"\nMuch of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. State-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and their own consumption.\nHowever, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild.\n\"They just use this premise to do illegal trading,\" Zhou Jinfeng, head of China's Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Reuters. \"There are no real pangolin farms in China, they just use the permits to do illegal things.\"\nThe NFGA did not respond to requests for comment.\nBLURRED LINES\nAnimal products, from bear bile to pangolin scales, are still used in some traditional Chinese medicine, an industry China wants to expand as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.\nBut the distinction between legal and illegal is blurred. The United Nations estimates the global illegal wildlife trade is worth about $23 billion a year. China is by far the largest market, environmental groups say.\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), an independent organization based in London which campaigns against what it sees as environmental abuses, said in a report this week the coronavirus outbreak has in fact boosted some illegal wildlife trafficking as traders in China and Laos are selling rhinoceros horn medicines as a treatment to reduce fever.\nChina's top legislature will toughen laws on wildlife trafficking this year, the official Xinhua news agency reported this week.\n\"We are in a sun-setting business,\" said Xiang Chengchuan, a wholesale wildlife store owner in the landlocked eastern Anhui province. \"Few people eat dogs now, but it was popular 20 years ago.\"\nXiang, who sells gift boxes of deer antlers and dog, donkey and peacock meat to wealthy bank clients and others, said he had frozen his meat as he waits to see if the ban will continue.\n\"I will resume selling once the policy allows us, but now I have no idea how long it [the ban] will last.\"\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, sending markets into a tailspin over fears of a global pandemic even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities.\nWhile health experts have expected limited outbreaks beyond China, the rapid acceleration of cases in Italy going from three on Friday to 220 on Monday is concerning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.\nJust as China put cities on lockdown, Italian authorities sealed off the worst-affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases.\nShops are shut, bars are closed and people speak to each other from a safe distance in northern Italy.\nMarkets are nervous that Europe could experience disruptions similar to China, where air traffic has been disrupted and global supply chains rattled for everything from medicine to cars to smartphones.\nBut China’s actions, especially in Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward, urging the rest of the world to learn the lesson of acting fast.\n“They’re at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in,” he said.\nThe surge of cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets as investors fled to safe havens. European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018. All three indexes closed down more than 3% after notching record highs last week on optimism the coronavirus would not seriously hurt global economies.\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index , jumped to a one-year high.\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word “pandemic” did yet not fit the facts.\n“We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,” he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.\nThe epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the WHO said.\nDr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies program, told reporters it was still possible to contain the virus and that it might appear each year like the flu.\n“The virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic,” he said in Geneva on Monday. “And at this point, it is not possible to say which of those realities is going to happen.”\nIn the United States, the White House is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading virus, a White House spokesman and an administration source said on Monday. Politico and the Washington Post had reported the Trump administration may request $1 billion.\nLiang Wannian of China’s National Health Commission said while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue.\nExcluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20.\nOverall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier. That took the total number of cases to 77,150, while the death toll rose by 150 to 2,592.\nThere was a measure of relief for the world’s second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections.\nOutside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to some 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.\nSouth Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833. Many are in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, which became more isolated with Asiana Airlines (020560.KS) and Korean Air (003490.KS) suspending flights there until next month.\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran, where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected. Most of the Iran  infections were in the Shi’ite Muslim holy city of Qom.\nA WHO team is due in Iran on Tuesday.\nJapan had 773 cases as of late Sunday, mostly on the cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo.\nIn South Korea, drone footage here showed what appeared to be hundreds of people queuing up outside a Daegu supermarket to buy face masks.\n(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus here)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health issues became the United States’ first fatality from the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday, as the Trump administration stepped up efforts to combat the spread of the global outbreak.\nThe patient, who was chronically ill prior to contracting COVID-19, died at EvergreenHealth Hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department’s communicable disease unit.\nThe state has recorded two other “presumptive” coronavirus cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, he said.\n“At this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that’s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,” Duchin said.\nThe two cases at the Kirkland facility were a health care worker in her 40s who is in satisfactory condition, and a woman in her 70s who lived there and is in serious condition.\n“It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,” the state’s governor, Jay Inslee, said in a statement. “We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.”\nThe first U.S. coronavirus death capped a week of stock market upheaval and escalating concern among state and federal health officials as the virus has spread across 46 countries and infected more than 60 people in the United States.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said lawmakers would take up a coronavirus spending bill next week “to advance a strong emergency funding supplemental package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis”.\nMost of the U.S. cases have occurred in travelers who were repatriated from China, where the virus originated.\nBut public health officials have also identified coronavirus cases in California, Washington and Oregon with no direct ties to the virus’ source in China, signaling a turning point in strategies needed to contain the disease in the United States.\nU.S. health authorities say it means the respiratory disease that has infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,800 in China is no longer an imported phenomenon but has taken up residence in the United States.\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here\n“We still judge the general risk to the American public to be low and that includes residents of long-term care facilities,” Nancy Messonier, head of the Immunization and Respiratory Disease division at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told reporters in a call on Saturday.\nMessonnier said the agency would send teams to support investigations in California and Washington into how patients contracted the virus and help trace who else may have been exposed.\nReuters graphics on the new coronavirus: here\nPERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted just 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the supposed epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nHealth officials said the advent of locally transmitted infections means authorities need to expand their focus from detecting a relatively limited number of cases, identifying close contacts and isolating them, to one that also emphasizes greater prevention among the public at large.\nIn particular, individuals should be more vigilant about basic hygiene measures, such as washing hands often, avoiding touching their faces, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home from school or work whenever ill, health officials say.\nCoronavirus is spread primarily through tiny droplets coughed or sneezed directly from an infected person into the face of someone nearby, as opposed to the more contagious “airborne” transmission of a virus like measles, which can remain suspended in enclosed spaces and be breathed in hours after being exhaled by sick individuals, experts say.\nCoronavirus can also survive on surfaces, such as handrails and door knobs, for “a very long period of time,” and be picked up by hand that way, though the virus is “very susceptible” to cleaning products, Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said on Friday in Santa Clara County.\nStill, “It’s mostly a person-to-person transmission that we are concerned about for our communities,” he added.\nFor the online coverage of the coronavirus outbreak click, here\n",

In all, the illness has killed nearly 3,000 people.\nHubei on Sunday reported 196 new infections, the first time since January it has reported fewer than 200 in a day, the National Health Commission said on Monday.\nAfter what some critics said was an initially hesitant response to the new virus, China imposed sweeping restrictions to try to stop it, including widespread suspensions of transport and extending a Lunar New Year holiday across the country.\nMi said authorities would transition from “overall containment to targeted containment” measures, with a focus on containment within communities, and medical treatment.\nWuhan’s Communist Party chief Chen Yixin hailed the government’s virus prevention efforts and said he expected the number of new cases to soon drop below 100 a day, the Communist Party’s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said.\n“The outbreak situation is under strong control,” Chen said of the situation in the city.\nMainland China had a total of 202 new confirmed cases on Sunday, the lowest since Jan. 22. All but six were in Hubei.\nThe death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 2,912 as of the end of Sunday, up by 42 from the previous day.\nHubei accounted for all of the 42 new deaths, with 32 of them in Wuhan.\nWith numbers of new infections falling, Wuhan closed its first specially built hospital after it discharged the last batch of 34 recovered patients, CCTV reported.\nWuhan opened 16 temporary hospitals, adding 13,000 beds and treating 12,000 people in response to the outbreak.\nEighteen provinces across China have lowered their coronavirus emergency response level in the past week, the latest being Zhejiang province.\nThere are also growing signs of the world’s second-biggest economy getting back to business after a crippling February that saw factory activity contract sharply.\nThe economy and information technology bureau in the commercial hub of Shanghai said that 66% of its businesses had resumed operations, though only 53% of small enterprises were back to work, underscoring lingering difficulties for private businesses.\nChinese shares soared on hopes the government would roll out more measures to support the economy. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC adding 3.2% on Monday, its best day since March 2019.\nBut as the country slowly returns to normal, President Xi Jinping has warned that China needed to take a long-term view of the outbreak and plug loopholes in emergency response mechanisms.\nThe case of an infected inmate released from a Wuhan prison, who then traveled to Beijing, had in particular prompted sharp criticism over loopholes.\nOn Monday, a government investigation team sent to Wuhan called the former inmate’s return to Beijing a “serious incident caused by dereliction of duty”, CCTV reported.\nIn an illustration of the dangers of what has evolved into a global epidemic, Beijing reported two new coronavirus cases in Chinese nationals who recently returned from Iran, where the outbreak has grown quickly.\nThe Global Times newspaper also reported on Monday an imported case, from someone returning from Italy, which has become Europe’s coronavirus hot spot.\n",

Some 565 of these were in Wuhan, where the outbreak emerged late last year.\nThe official China News wire service reported that 233 of the Wuhan cases were reported from the city’s prison system.\nThe 35 new deaths reported on Saturday were the second lowest daily total in February and down from 47 the previous day, however. There were also only three new cases outside Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, the lowest since the commission began tracking daily cases on Jan. 20.\nA total of 2,870 people have died from the outbreak in mainland China and 79,824 have been infected by the virus.\nChinese officials have reiterated that efforts to curb the outbreak are achieving positive results, with the daily new cases being reported trending lower in recent weeks.\nTo cushion the economic impact of the epidemic, China has ordered districts to be classified into “high-risk”, “medium-risk” and “low-risk”, with the latter expected to end traffic curbs and let everyone resume work.\nOn Saturday, Hubei said 11 of its 103 counties had reported no new cases for at least 14 days, meeting “low-risk” criteria. But as many as 58 of its counties are still deemed “high-risk”.\nChina needs to take a long-term view of the outbreak and plug loopholes in its laws and emergency response mechanisms, President Xi Jinping said in speeches published in the Communist Party’s theoretical journal, Qiushi (Seeking Truth), on Sunday.\nChina must set up an emergency reserve and supply system to ensure vital materials are deployed at critical times, he added.\nAs coronavirus cases spread overseas, Beijing is starting to raise its guard to avoid a resurgence of the outbreak through travelers from other countries.\nMore than 50 countries have reported cases with Mexico and San Marino the latest additions. In a bulletin issued Saturday, the World Health Organization said there were 6,009 cases outside China, an increase of 1,318 from the previous day.\nChina has refrained from blanket travel bans, but some local governments, such as in Beijing, have ordered self-quarantine for travelers from countries where the virus has spread.\nBeijing on Sunday reported two new cases: both are Chinese nationals who recently returned from Iran, where the coronavirus cases have multiplied quickly.\nChina will take steps to bring back citizens from high-risk countries if necessary, foreign ministry official Cui Aimin told reporters on Sunday. He said Beijing has arranged 10 flights to bring home 1,314 so far, but did not name any countries.\n",

The secretary said he had briefed Congress more than 70 times on Iran, rejecting allegations that he had not been accessible.\nThe hearing was meant to focus on the Trump administration's dealings with Iran and Iraq, but many of the questions centred on the coronavirus. Pompeo said he was confident that the administration had taken action to reduce the threat.\nThe COVID-19 illness caused by a new coronavirus that emerged in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan has stretched well beyond Asia. The global count of those infected as of Friday exceeds 83,000, with China still by far the hardest-hit country. Dozens of cases but no deaths have been confirmed in the United States.\nPompeo's testimony comes three weeks after the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, who was accused of abusing his office by withholding aid from Ukraine while he was seeking an investigation into Democratic rival Joe Biden. Trump, who denied doing anything wrong, was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.\nThe inquiry before House legislators featured the testimony of several foreign service officers, including some who had been enlisted to try to carry out the Republican president's wishes and expressed concerns over it.\nThough Pompeo was not a central figure to the impeachment inquiry, he has faced criticism for not doing more to stand up for a workforce that has been attacked by the president - including Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, who was removed last spring after a push by the president's allies.\n",

Otherwise, they see the supply of the population as endangered.\n\"More extensive testing of clinical health is medical nonsense,\" said the head of the Federal Medical Association of Cassation (KBV), Andreas Gassen, on Tuesday in Berlin. In order to reduce the spread of the viruses, the Leipzig Book Fair was cancelled. In Saarland and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, there were first confirmed Coronavirus infections. This is now proven in all the federal states except Saxony-Anhalt.\nIf anyone has a suspicion of the Coronavirus on their own, they should not immediately visit a practice, Germany's top cashier warned Gassen. Tests only make sense if someone has symptoms of upper respiratory disease and may have had contact with infected people. In any case, according to KBV, people who feared an infection of their own should first call the practice or the doctor's line 116 117. Because in most cases infections with the Coronavirus were mild.\nIf an infected person immediately visits a practice, it was also said that it could be temporarily closed by the competent health authority for disease protection reasons. Last week, 11.000 tests for the Coronavirus were carried out, but only 188 Sars-CoV-2 infections were detected until Tuesday morning.\nOn Tuesday, the Berlin Charite opened its own investigation centre for possible corona virus infections, in front of which people were quickly queuing up. The pilot project should be a model for other hospitals, said Medical Director Ulrich Frei.\nFrance confiscated protective masks.

The masks should be distributed to healthcare workers and citizens infected with the new Coronavirus.\nThe city and the region of Aachen deviate from the recommendations of the Robert-Koch Institute (RKI) on the Coronavirus to ensure the operation of the clinic. In case of an infection in the workforce in a station, employees without symptoms of illness are no longer quarantined as recommended by the RKI. Such a quarantine could paralyse entire stations, the crisis teams justified the decision. After a positive Coronavirus test on a nurse at the nursery station, the consequences had become clear: because the woman in the ICU had contact with 45 forces, they should have been quarantined for 14-day periods according to RKI recommendations. The clinic stressed that this would put an end to work in the ICU.\nThe city of Essen urges the organizers of events from 25 persons to collect the personal data of all participants. In the event of a later identified infection, it should be possible to identify all the others without delay.\nTwitter has called all its employees worldwide to work from home because of the Coronavirus threat.\nApproximately half of the 188 Sars-CoV-2 infections recorded from RKI to Tuesday morning have been reported in North Rhine-Westphalia. In addition, Bavaria and Baden-Wurttemberg are currently more affected. A virus-related death has not yet been recorded in Germany. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) announced a government statement on crisis management at Sars-CoV-2 on Wednesday. A meeting with national health ministers is also planned.\nThe vast majority of the infected have no complaints or only cold symptoms that quickly subsidYeah. Heavier disease progressions, such as pneumonia, are developing up to a 15-percent, according to the world's previous knowledge. This often includes old people and patients with pre-existing illnesses. The isolation of those affected and the search for contact persons are carried out in order to slow down the spread of the virus as much as possible. This should maintain as much capacity as possible in the health system.\nOutside China, where the virus originated, South Korea is currently the most severely affected by Sars-CoV-2 following the official reporting. More than 4800-year-old infections have meanwhile been reported by the authorities, with at least 28 people dying of Covid-19. Northern Italy is particularly affected in the EU. According to civil protection data from Monday evening, more than 2000 infections were recorded in Italy as a whole, more than 50 of the infected died. In China, the number of officially registered infections was more than 80.000 on Tuesday, the number of deaths was nearly 3000. Experts, however, assume a high dark number.\nAccording to the RKI, around 90.900 people in 73 countries have been shown to be infected with the new Coronavirus worldwide. \"The situation is moving away from China and the rest of the world is increasingly affected,\" said Vice President Lars Schaade. Since Monday there have been officially 115 cases in China, in the remaining 72 countries 1700 cases.\nThe rapid spread of the new Coronavirus has unforeseeable consequences for European airlines. Several airline heads reported a sharp drop in booking numbers. Lufthansa chief Carsten Spohr stated that currently 23 of 200 long-range machines remained on the ground due to the virus crisis.\nCSU chief South wants to push through a stimulus package for the economy ravaged by the Coronavirus: \"This includes significantly lower energy prices and corporate taxes, but also investmenFDP chief Christian Lindner called on the government to put in place an \"anti-crisis package\" against the economic consequences of a Coronavirus epidemic.\nIn Norway, the cruise ship Aida Aura was initially stuck on Tuesday because two German passengers suspected Sars-CoV-2 infection.

With the increasing spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, Europe is now increasingly at the forefront.\nContern produces the material for the protective suits. The fibrous material made of plastic is called Tyvek and is very thin and light, extremely tear-resistant and breathable. On huge rolls the fabric goes to nine seams especially in Asia, where the coats are then made. The American specialist chemical company Dupont usually produces 200 million protective suits a year. This year, because of the extreme demand, Germany said, it would be much more.\nThe disposable protective suits were mainly made by dealers to people dealing with the infected and patients: doctors, nurses and nurses. In addition, the need for authorities, policemen and customs officers who controlled people is growing. Dupont has two plants worldwide that produce the fabric for protective clothing: one in Richmond in the USA, the other in Contern in Luxembourg.\nWith the raging Coronavirus, other companies also report a rush on their products: for example, manufacturers of disinfectants or respiratory masks. However, most companies suffer from the consequences of the new virus: every second company in Germany expects a decline in sales after a survey of the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK) day.\nIn the Dupont factory in Luxembourg, the company runs around the clock, the employees work overtime. \"The Coronavirus means an enormous amount of work and energy for our work,\" said plant manager Paul MeyerYeah. However, around 1200 employees were \"highly motivated\" to help the affected people on the ground. Contern is currently developing a new product line for 340 million euro.\nAccording to a spokesman from Dupont Germany, the demand for protective clothing is currently higher than what the company can provide. But \"the best\" is done. \"We have changed the distribution channels to get the production volume into the crisis areas.\" It also means that other Tyvek products, such as envelopes or medical packaging material, would currently be produced less.\nIn addition to seven sewers in Asia, there is also one in Mexico and one in Romania for Europe, Germany said.

        "news_content_translate_en": "On this Friday, the German Red Cross (DRC) is expecting more travellers from the Chinese town of Wuhan, which is particularly affected by the Coronavirus, in Stuttgart.\nThe DRC takes over the care on behalf of the federal government, said a spokesman for the relief organisation on Thursday in Berlin. A spokesman for the Baden-Wuttemberg Ministry of Social Affairs said the health authorities were prepared for the arrival of the people. Initially, the Southwest Round had reported on this.\nAccording to information from the German Press Agency, more than a dozen people are to fly to Stuttgart. They first arrive in Paris with other Europeans in a French plane and are expected in the morning at Stuttgart airport. After their arrival, the travellers are to be examined and then probably taken to a quarantine station in the district of Esslingen.\nThe DRC had already operated a quarantine station in Germersheim (Rhineland-Palatinate) to which the first German returnees from Wuhan on the 1st. February had come. At the moment, it still handles passengers on a later return flight to Berlin.\nOutside mainland China, more than ten Covid-19 deaths have now been recorded, with dozens of people in critical condition. Covid-19 is the disease caused by the new Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2.\nIn South Korea, the number of infections recorded doubled by 53 to 104 within one day. A man died in a hospital in the southeastern city of Cheongdo, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of the new cases were reported from Daegu and the province of North Gyeongsang. Authorities suspect that many of those affected were infected with Sars-CoV-2 when they visited the divine service of a Christian sect in Daegu. Around 2,5 million people live in DaegYeah. Concerned about the uncontrolled spread of the virus, they should stay home for the time being.\nThe extent of possible infections in Iran was still unclear. Two Covid-19 deaths had been reported in the city of Ghom on Wednesday; no infection had previously been reported in the country. It's supposed to be two older men. According to authorities, the persons concerned had not been outside their home town of Ghom. They also had no contact with Chinese tourists. According to the Ministry of Health, there are also three other proven infections in the country. All schools and universities in Ghom were provisionally closed, as reported by IRNA. The almost 1,2 million inhabitants of Ghom should avoid physical contact.\nMeanwhile, China has again changed the number of confirmed infections. As the Health Commission said, clinical diagnoses should no longer be included as confirmed cases in the statistics. The severely affected province of Hubei, where the virus had broken out, had only last week begun to count such diagnoses. Physicians determine the disease based on lung images and the physical condition. Now, once again, only DNA tests in the lab are to be considered.\nThe official statistics recorded until Thursday around 75.000 infections and more than 2100 deaths in the country. Experts, however, have long been expecting a much higher dark figure. Even a Chinese scientist is now questioning whether the epidemic can still be stopped and the virus disappears again. Covid-19 could become an established disease like the flu, said Wang Chen, president of the China Academy of Medical Science, on state televisioYeah.\nAccording to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, two clinical trials are under way in China to treat patients. Provisional results should be expected in three weeks. Among other things, the trial included medicines against the AIDS agent HIV.\nIn Japan, two passengers of the cruise ship Diamond Princess were killed by the new Coronavirus. It was already known that more than twenty of the patients infected with Sars-CoV-2 were seriously ill. Now an 84-year-old Japanese woman and an 87-year-old Japanese woman died, as the Japanese television station NHK reported. The cruise ship had been under quarantine for two weeks with a passenger after being identified. Among the original 3700 passengers and crew members, 634 infections were detected until Thursday. All those affected came to hospitals.\nPassengers who tested negative for the virus, like the previous day, had more than 500 people on board. An Italian returnee with around twenty Italians and as many other Europeans should land in Germany, among other things. Passengers who could return to their home country include four with German nationality and two of their spouses. A couple want to stay in Japan first, two more Germans are proven to be infected and are treated in a Japanese clinic.\nSome visitors were expected from the \"Diamond Princess\" in Berlin: \"There will probably be a landing in Tegel this Saturday, again in the military part, because two Berliners are among the passengers,\" said Health Senator Dilek Kalayci. The plan was to isolate them at home for a fortnight. Those who do not live in Berlin are then first brought by DRK staff to their hometowYeah.\nOn the way home, passengers of the cruise ship Westerdam, with which 57 Germans had also landed a few days ago, remained in Cambodia. According to the Ministry of Health of North Rhine-Westphalia, ten people from the Federal Republic were on board. Six of them are already home. According to the Recklinghausen district, the remaining four passengers will land this Friday by plane in Dusseldorf. The two couples from Dorsten and Recklinghausen are to be quarantined at home. Except for one American, the Sars-CoV-2 virus has so far not been detected in any of the people on Westerdam. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "For Matthias Denneburg everything went as usual: the exhibition stands of his clients were finished, the assembly teams were booked, the cars rented, hotel rooms reserved. But then the trade fair in Cologne cancelled the hardware fair and moved it to spring 2021. Because of the \"worldwide situation around the occurrence of the Coronavirus\". A third of the exhibitors were from China, where the corona epidemic began. Three of them were clients of Zenit Messebau, Denneburg's company.\nThe rejection in Cologne is by no means the only one. For the same reason, the Frankfurt Trade Fair cancelled the Light + Building Building Building Building Building Technology Exhibition and moved it to September. In Augsburg, Denneburg's people were stopped in the middle of building stands for a meeting of an electricity wholesaler because the organiser canceled the fair. The Geneva car dealership could not take place either, it is said, from industry circles.\nThe Coronavirus is becoming a risk for many companies, and it is precisely the medium-sized ones that could cause millions of damage. The volume of orders for the hardware fair alone \"is in the six digit range\", says Denneburg. Today, a booth is a high-tech building made of high-quality materials with ceiling installations, LED walls, screens, VR installations. The company from Cologne is now trying to limit the damage: \"What we could stop, we stopped.\" Whoever has to bear what costs now, he is clarifying with the clients.\nSimilarly, Ute Yiannakis, Managing Director of the Exhibition Facility Profile & Design from Bad Honnef. The exhibition stands are in stock for the 200-Chinese exhibitors at the Frankfurt fair Light + Building, as she says. An order volume of approximately 180.000 euro. The exhibition has been cancelled since Monday.\nThe industry is heavily uncertaiYeah. The impact of the Corona crisis on trade fair construction companies, trade fair organisers and event agencies is \"already dramatic\", says Jan Kalbfleisch, Managing Director of the Famab Branch Association, who sees his member companies before difficult times.\" The more international the trade fair is, the higher the likelihood that it will be cancelled,\"he says. There is no compelling reason for this at the moment.\" According to the Ministry of Health and Robert Koch-Institut, we currently have a low to moderate risk,\"Kalbmeat says, complaining:\"Currently, the limit to hysteria has been crossed. We hope for the return of reason.\"\nIn Frankfurt, the Light + building failed to meet official medical requirements. Exhibition staff from China should be fully interviewed and checked repeatedly.\" The Health Department asked us to carry out a multi-stage health check, which could not be carried out by the fair,\"says Trade Fair spokesman Markus Quint. The Authority did not request a refusal, the trade fair decided to do so itself.\nSuch decisions are also accompanied by the risk that exhibitors may leave in turn, which means that the fair loses its attractiveness. In this way, the Barcelona Mobile Radio Fair had recently shrunk until the organiser cancelled it.\nOne of Germany's biggest industry shows is still resisting the virus. The Berlin International Tourism Exchange is due to open on Wednesday. On Friday, however, the Federal Government's Crisis Staff wants to discuss ITB and balance health protection against economic interests. About 400-exhibitors from Italy, the current Corona's main risk area in Europe, are said to have already cancelled, according to the trade fair management, who also points out that only 16-000 exhibitors would come from mainland ChinaYeah.\nThe Tourism Fair wants to be prepared against the virus: donors for disinfectants should be present at all inputs and outputs, outlets should point to protective measures, the cleaning intervals of sanitary facilities will be increased. All exhibitors, trade visitors and journalists must declare in writing prior to admission whether they have been in Corona risk regions during the last two weeks, the incubation period of the virus, or whether they have had contact with such people.\nBut all this remains an attempt to minimize the risk of infection, because the fair cannot force anyone to truthfully answer the questionnaires.\" We do not expect visitors to give false information,\"says trade fair spokeswoman Britta Wolters.\"We do not expect visitors to give false information.\" We appeal to common sense and the responsibility of all.\"The need for information is only temporary anyway: at 7th. and 8. In March, when the trade fair opens for private visitors, these controls should be abolished, at least as planned to date.\nAccording to the Berlin trade fair, Fruit Logistica, the main trade fair for fruit and vegetables in February already had such protective measures. Here half of the Chinese producers said no. After the big tourism fair ITB will follow rather smaller events in Berlin, the next trade fair is at the end of April. Then comes the ILA Air Show. Large events similar to ITB will not be held until September.\nIt could be a positive thing for exhibitors and exhibitors that the exhibition centres still have free periods later in the year in which they can now put cancelled events.\" It is half good that the hardware fair will take place next year,\"says the Cologne Messebauer Denneburg,\"then turnover only shifts.\"Ute Yiannakis of the company from Bad Honnef has contractually insured against economic damage:\"We demand fifty percent of the order amount already one month before the fair starts\"This should at least cover the cost of the preparations.\nBut the postponement has limits, as Harald Koter of the trade fair organisers'association says: \"This is not an easy process, the dates have to be in tune with the industry.\" The toy fair Nuremberg at the end of January is consciously located at the beginning of the year, because it is focused on the Christmas business. An appointment in the second half of the year would be too late to acquire the large contracts sought. It looks similar for the winter sports fair Ispo, which ended a few days ago, and is aimed at the season of the following year.\" In the course of trade fairs, buyers place large orders,\"says Koter.\"The buyer It is therefore important to respect these time-frames as far as possible, particularly in the consumer goods sector.\"\nIt is quite possible that the Coronavirus will lead to one or other legal dispute. Exhibitors could sue trade fair companies for damages. Fair companies are, of course, based on the recommendations and specifications of health authorities and public health professionals. Whether they cancel a mass, they decide for themselves. The Messe Frankfurt, which stopped the Light + Building because of the high administrative requirements, nevertheless sees itself on the safe side.\" We assume higher force, as fulfilling the conditions would have meant a disproportionate burden,\"says the trade fair spokesman Quint. In conclusion, however, this is not yet possible. For there has never been such a situation.",

What about the credibility of the regime? How does the device work and why did it fail after the virus broke out? These questions and more are answered by Sebastian Heilmann, professor at the University of Trier and former director of the Berlin think tank Merics.\nONLINE TIME: China's government is now gradually lifting the quarantine of Wuhan and Hubei and for a week now the leadership in Beijing has declared that there are no new infections in the country. They just came in from abroad. No more Sars-CoV-2 cases in China after the official confirmation of 800.000 infections since January, can this be?\nSebastian Heilmann: It is a decision of the Politburo that the epidemic is over. Of course, the virus is not gone, but there must be no more negative messages. We have evidence that the epidemic has been contained. However, there is unofficial information that there are still cases in Southwest China that are suspected of Covid-19. The risk of a new infection wave therefore remains concrete for China. What we are seeing now is, above all, a political approach. All unpleasant information is suppressed, and the propaganda apparatus formulates the most important story in the end itself: that the epidemic has been defeated thanks to the superiority of China's system.\nONLINE TIME: A key reason for lifting restrictions in society and the economy is the bad economic climate. The lockdown broke China's economy in the first quarter. How does the Beijing leadership want to tackle the economic crisis? Europe and the USA are the main markets for China because of the virusYeah.\nHeilmann: China's economy, according to what we can sum up from various sources, is again at about 80 percent of its performance. But there is a real catch-up in China. The great unknown is now the demand. We have a global break-in that affects China's exports and supply chains and is hardly countervailable. Domestic demand is also uncertain: are people buying cars or 5G phones again to the extent expected before the crisis? Beijing will now have to save companies with its state banks, especially in the private sector, where liquidity is very tight and with minimal margins. Many small and medium-sized enterprises are on the brink.\nONLINE TIME: Will China spend as much money on this as 2009 did in the financial crisis?\nHeilmann: So far, the Chinese government has been reluctant, in flagrant contrast to the US and the major European economies, which are actually flown with support programmes. China had imposed on 2009 a huge incentive programme of 17% of gross domestic product, which also boosted demand strongly worldwide, but caused serious distortions in investment behaviour in China. Similar programmes have not yet been identified in China. Foreign projects such as the New Silk Road will also have to cope with significantly less funding in the coming years.\nONLINE TIME: Will China invest less abroad in the future?\nNot necessarily. We must expect Chinese investors to make targeted advances against companies and industries that have been closed to them so far. Crisis-related prices would be favourable for investments and acquisitions in Europe. I can imagine that many small and medium-sized businesses in Germany, to whom the economic recession is adding, are quite willing to sell. This is expected to become an increasingly important issue in the coming weeksYeah.\nTIME ONLINE: Party leader Xi Jinping now sends solidarity addresses to other countries, state and companies donate and sell medical supplies abroad, including to Europe, for example in hard-hit Italy. It may be suspected that this is not entirely unhelpful, that Beijing not only wants to improve its geopolitical position towards the Washington government, but is also seeking goodwill so that as many European states as possible, for example, choose to do so, engage latent spy suspect 5G network equipment Huawei. Is that right?\nHeilmann: Beijing is clearly about opening doors in Europe. And let us not delude ourselves: international investment is, of course, welcome in crisis-ridden European economies. China continues to invest heavily in 5G, and from there companies will come to us and say:'We will build you the infrastructure and bring the funding right away'; some governments will not be able to resist.\nTIME ONLINE: Can something be done about the sale of companies?\nHeilmann: The EU and national governments want to prevent a sale out in times of crisis, if necessary through state participation in companies. But I would suggest a more offensive strategy towards Beijing: \"You are helping us now, selling and giving us medical aid, which we appreciate, but we want a moratorium as a confidence-building measure, that, during this crisis phase, no European companies are acquired using Chinese state banks or other state funding models.\"\nI think this is a viable path. The Chinese government will be open to such a proposal, because the rabid acquisition campaigns of American investors in crisis-ridden Asian economies, such as the Asia crisis between 1997 and 1999, are repeatedly criticized harshly in ChinaYeah. Chinese investors do not want to be seen as hedgehogs.\nONLINE TIME: It is a thin line between the resurgence of Covid-19 infections and the stimulation of the economy. How does China intend to strengthen domestic demand?\nHeilmann: With the aim of economic stimulus and social compensation, China's government is expected to introduce generous tax relief up to coupon programs so that even those on low incomes can participate in economic recovery through their consumption. I also believe that targeted purchase subsidies for cars or the badly indebted real estate sector are well possible.\nTIME ONLINE: Is there anything known about widespread dissatisfaction in the population due to the virus crisis?\nHeilmann: Dissatisfaction is regularly articulated in social media. However, as I see it, the monitoring methods have been tightened up and modernised to such an extent that no protest can be organised at the moment. In the course of the fight against the epidemic in China, we see a dramatic increase in the pooled analysis of location data, facial recognition and behavioural profiles. This epidemic has dramatically accelerated the expansion of digital surveillance in China. The control apps developed to combat the epidemic will be introduced in an adapted form in Chinese everyday life.\nONLINE TIME: What is the current status of the regime in the Chinese population?\nHeilmann: Compared to the disastrous epidemic in Italy or the USA, there are now many positive, system-supporting statements. They are generated on the one hand by propaganda, but there is also a lot of spontaneous support. A kind of live system comparison is currently taking place in front of all of us: which country is coping well with the pandemic? Chinese look to South Korea, Japan, also Italy, but especially to the USYeah. They see that the US may not have been able to cope with this epidemic and may be badly damaged economically and politically. And that, paradoxically, China's global status is being promoted by the pandemic, which originated from China but fought successfully there.\nTIME ONLINE: Does the KP leadership also interpret their handling of the epidemic as superiority of the authoritarian one-party system?\nHeilmann: The KP has grown up as a campaign party, it has won the revolution 1949 through mass mobilization and coercion. Since then, the KP has resorted to campaigns in every crisis situation. This kind of emergency mobilization is in the DNA of this party. The party headquarters can switch to crisis mode within a very short period of time, push aside bureaucratic rules and apparatus and drive huge waves of pressure through the entire system that no one can resist. Hard collective disciplinary measures such as the recent outbreak of the epidemic are the natural playing field for the KP.\nTIME ONLINE: There have recently been disinformation campaigns based on official Chinese authorities and partisan media: Suggestions that the virus did not come from Wuhan, that US soldiers had brought it to China or that it came from Italy. Such campaigns against other governments seldom come from Beijing. Why now?\nHeilmann: Chinese disinformation campaigns have been more frequent recently, for example in the Xinjiang question, against Taiwan or Hong Kong, most recently also against Sweden, i.e. smaller political players. But now we are seeing a global campaign aimed at changing the Corona story. China is responsible in two ways from the Western perspective. On the one hand, the initial phase was overslept and early warnings from Chinese doctors were suppressed, which made the pandemic only possibleYeah. And Beijing has allowed hundreds of thousands of Chinese to travel abroad in the last January Ridge. China therefore has a central role and responsibility as the starting point of the pandemic. But this storyline is harmful from the point of view of the Communist Party; it must be changed for the benefit of China.\nONLINE TIME: But the seriousness of the Chinese leadership, at least in Western countries, suffers with the spread of Hanover conspiracy theories.\nHeilmann: China's KP likes to see itself as the guardian of scientific evidence and expertise, especially in contrast to the Trump government, but also in contrast to Russian disinformation and destabilisation campaigns. I therefore think that the KP propaganda will backfire. The conspiracy theory about an American origin of the virus can be interpreted more as a test balloon of foreign policy hawks in Beijing. The party leadership is not aiming for confrontation, but for the country to be willing and helpful internationally in the Corona crisis and not irresponsible and manipulative.\nONLINE TIME: Does China's propaganda actually tell its people the same stories about the origin of the virus?\nHeilmann: Debt assignments to the US, which at the same time deflect responsibility from China, spread quickly in China's social media, because they meet the national pride of many. On the other hand, despite censorship and propaganda, most Chinese are far too clever not to recognize such simple distractions. Many are simply skeptical of official statements about the Coronavirus, because they were personally affected by this epidemic and were able to make their own observations. I expect that the story of a mysterious foreign origin of the virus will therefore not come trueYeah.\nONLINE TIME: The outbreak of the Coronavirus showed that the KP leadership was not informed about everything. The epidemic represents exactly the opposite of what the party stands for: it carries the risk of social unrest and shows that, despite the lessons learned from the Sars crisis 2003, no action was taken on the basis of scientific criteria. How could it have come to this?\nHeilmann: The KP elite in the closed party and government center Zhongnanhai in Beijing employs loyal officials and experts who receive many messages that others will never see and who filter and evaluate them for the KP leadership. These are very serious and highly trained forces, analytically sharp, strategically thinking.\nBut they are by no means risk-averse, which is typical of a highly centralised, authoritarian system such as the Chinese one. The hierarchy of officials has the greatest difficulty in passing on unpleasant or even catastrophic information, which has to be carried from bottom to top of many levels in the KP hierarchy, from the local level to the centre. This system is based on so many information filters that politically undesirable findings make it difficult to get to headquarters in time. We can see from this that freedom of information and freedom of the press is a really good thing.\nONLINE TIME: Will party leader Xi Jinping and his ruling KP rather weaken or emerge stronger from the Corona disaster?\nHeilmann: Unless there are new waves of infection in China and chaotic conditions in the USA, Xi and the KP will definitely emerge from the pandemic. If the American economy and the US dollar are seriously damaged as a result of the pandemic, then China will emerge as a winner from the system comparisoYeah. If that happens, we will then be living on another planet, with completely different political and economic forces than before the pandemic",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In China, the number of deaths has increased due to the new Coronavirus. The Health Commission reported 150-new Covid-19 deaths, more than ever in one day. Overall, therefore, 2.592 people died of lung disease in China. In addition, the number of infected by 409 cases increased to more than 77.000.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese authorities have already withdrawn the quarantine of the most severely affected millions of metropolis of Wuhan after a few hours. The easing had been announced \"without consent\" by a transport committee to local management and therefore \"invalid\", the city administration announced.\nPreviously it was said that people without a place of residence in the city would now be allowed to leave under certain conditions. It had counted that they showed no possible symptoms of infectious disease and had no contact with Coronavirus patients. It is also reported that people who show compelling reasons for leaving the city could have obtained a travel permit. These reasons include, for example, their reliance on the medical treatment of other diseases outside Wuhan. All persons wishing to leave need official authorization. They should also have registered with the local authorities at their Chinese destinations and had their health monitored for two weeks.\nWuhan is considered the starting point of the epidemic and was on 23rd. In January, the authorities largely sealed off the outside world. However, many foreign nationals have since been returned to their home countries on special flights. For the first time, experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO) have visited the citYeah. An international expert group visited two hospitals, the National Health Commission in China announced. One of the clinics had been provisionally set up in a sports centre.\nAccording to the Chinese authorities, the expert group also met the head of the Chinese Health Commission, Ma Xiaowei, and other persons responsible for the disease protection of the province of Hubei, in which Wuhan is located. The WHO representatives were reported to have arrived in China more than a week ago.\nAt the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organisation, WHO, the incidence of pneumonia of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).\nSars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 are the same pathogens that infect bats. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, every third party has died of itYeah.\nOverall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.\nMedical practitioners assume that the virus is transmitted from person to person mainly by drip infection.\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nMore than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers suspect roughly somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.\nFollow the progress of registered cases in Germany on this map.\nThe number of infected worldwide tested positive for Corona shows this map from Johns Hopkins University.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO is treating the disease as a pandemic. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.\nTypical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinations. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccination.\nChina's head of state and party Xi Jinping spoke the day before of the \"biggest health crisis\" since the founding of the state 194Yeah. He called for vigorous measures to control the epidemic. After economic life had been severely slowed down or even halted in some places, according to state media reports, the President also called for the slow resumption of work and production, depending on the assessment of health risks on the ground.\nIn regions where the risk is \"relatively low\", the fight against the virus should focus on preventing its introduction, while production and public life should be restarted. Areas with a \"medium risk\" should resume work and production depending on the local situation of the epidemic, while regions \"with a risk\" should continue to focus fully on control and prevention.\nSouth Korea also reported a further spread of the virus. With 161 further confirmed cases, the number of infected people is now in 763 humans. The number of deaths also increased to seven. After China and Japan, South Korea is now the country with the third highest infection rates. The majority of newly reported infections focus on the southeastern millionaire city of Daegu and its surroundings. Previously, the government had issued the highest alert for infectious diseases. Only 129 of the new infections were again counted among members of the Christian sect Shincheonji Church of Jesus. More than half of all cases in the country are those of the sect, which is strongly represented in Daegu.\nIn Europe, Italy is most affected by more than 150 infections and three deaths. On Sunday evening, trains between Italy and Austria were stopped for several hours. Two Eurocities were stopped by the Austrian authorities at the Brenner on their way from Venice to Munich. One of the trains had two German women on board who had fever and severe cougYeah. However, according to the Austrian Ministry of the Interior, they were tested negative in Verona. After that, the 500-passengers were able to continue to Munich.\nIn the north of Italy, several municipalities were sealed off. In the province of Lodi in Lombardy, ten municipalities were declared closed zones, as well as the municipality of Vo in Veneto. Schools, universities and museums remain closed. The carnival in Venice, which was due to end by Tuesday, was also prematurely ended.\nDiseases and deaths have been recorded in more than twenty other countries. Recently, initial infections from Kuwait, Bahrain and Afghanistan have been reported. In Iran, the number of deaths was reported to have increased to twelve.\nBecause of the new Coronavirus, protective masks have been sold out in many pharmacies for weeks, and they are scarcely supplied.\" There are indeed significant and immediate supply bottlenecks,\"said Thomas Porstner, Managing Director of the Federal Association of Wholesale Pharmaceuticals. The increased demand was due to the Coronavirus, according to a spokesman of the German Pharmaceutical Association (ABDA).\nHowever, concrete figures are not available for both associations. At the moment, however, there are only \"smallest quantities,\" Porstner said. Many wholesalers could no longer order goods. When manufacturers can produce enough masks, be unclear.\nBut this was not a cause for panic, the ABDA spokesman said. Healthy people travelling in Germany do not need a mask.\"A simple mouth-nose protection, as nurses and doctors wear it in surgeries, does not protect against infection with the new virus Sars-CoV-2.\" It is more a matter of respect for others.

This is in a letter on behalf of the Kirill Varlamov foundation, which tasis owns.\nAt present, with the global epidemic situation and the rapid spread of covid-19 virus in Russia, it is particularly urgent to develop telemedicine in Russia. \" -Take note of the text in the letter. It also said, The Russian news agency stated that the law on amending certain legislation of the Russian Federation on the application of information technology in the field of health, which came into force on January 1, 2018, laid a foundation for the application of information technology in the field of health 2. Using telemedicine to provide medical assistance remotely. However, Varlamov pointed out that the method does not specify the possibility of diagnosis or the possibility of treatment for the diagnosis results. This greatly reduces the application of telemedicine technologyAbout\n\"In this regard, it is clear that there is a need for the speedy adoption of a bill to expand the power of doctors in remote assistance, That is, the possibility of remote diagnosis and treatment. \" This will reduce the number of people entering treatment facilities and help to care for more patients.\nAs the director of the Department of legal initiatives, Freya Alexandra olehovic, pointed out, at present, Russian law does not allow doctors to diagnose and treat remotely, That is to say, doctors can only do so legally after an individual has been treated. \" In the case of limited mobility, access to qualified medical assistance should not be denied. This is also particularly important for older people who are particularly at risk. This interim measure should be able to quickly detect potentially dangerous conditions in the early stages of the disease, including coronavirus, And prevent people from congregating in medical institutions \"- quote his words from the foundation press office.\nThe French agency for international development cooperation stands ready to provide expert and organizational support for the drafting of the bill.\nDoctor's opinion\nThis is an important decision in the current epidemic situation, especially in this case, When patients only need to ask question。 There is a group of people who run on every little thing and ask for expert advice, but in principle they don't need to. Therefore, in some cases, especially in the case of therapeutic diseases, adequate online tutoring, including video tutoring, can be provided -Share with TASS, associate doctor of medicine, associate professor, surgeon oncologist Sergei osminin\nAccording to him, this not only helps to reduce virus infection, including the spread of coronavirus, but also helps to filter patients in the outpatient department, They really need expert personal advice. \" I think it's even necessary in this case, because we can assess the patient's condition by phone. Through telemedicine, we can see the vision of a patient, and he can tell us what is bothering him. According to the protocol, we can specify symptom treatment \"- add immunocorrection to the general manager of tacis medical center. Hotanova, doctor - physician Lyudmila rapa.\nHowever, doctors point out that the main problem in this area is to take this consultation seriously. \" Not every doctor can take on such a responsibility, which actually seems easy. It needs knowledge and experience. The main task is not to hurt, \"she explained.\n\"When the doctor is responsible, he should recommend hospitalization in any dangerous situation, or should still go to see the doctor.About In my opinion, about 50% of requests can be reduced in this way, \"osmium concluded.\nCoronavirus pandemic\nA new outbreak of coronavirus has occurred in Central China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - As Argentina was scrambling to introduce emergency measures to insulate its ailing economy from the coronavirus last week, the Chinese ambassador paid a visit to the home of President Alberto Fernandez to discuss an offer.\nAt the meeting in the wealthy Olivos suburb of Buenos Aires, ambassador Zou Xiaoli laid out how the Asian giant was ready to help Argentina face the pandemic: donating masks, gloves, thermometers and protective suits.\nThe donations, welcomed by Fernandez’s government, show how China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is jostling for influence against the United States.\nFrom Argentina to Mexico, Brazil to Peru, Latin American nations have accepted offers of support from China as the number of coronavirus cases across the region has climbed, amid growing fears about the preparedness of their healthcare systems.\nThere have been nearly 500,000 confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, and over 20,000 deaths.\nAlthough South America has so far not been as hard hit as other parts of the world, experts fear that may change as winter arrives in the southern hemisphere.\n“Some countries in the region have reached out to China asking for help,” a Chinese official in Buenos Aires, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. “We will share with them our experience in combating COVID-19 and offer sanitary materials within our capacity.”\nAs trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have simmered in recent years, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Latin American nations that they should be wary of becoming too economically reliant on China - to little avail.\nIn Argentina, the region’s third-largest economy, China has made steady in-roads, from solar power investments to the construction of a new space monitoring station. It has supplied over $17 billion of financing since 2007, Inter-American Dialogue data shows. China has also become the top consumer of Argentine soybeans and beef.\nAs the coronavirus spread in China, Argentina’s new left-leaning leader Fernandez - who took office in December - exchanged correspondence with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nIn letters seen by Reuters, Fernandez offered solidarity to China in February as the virus raged from the outbreak center of Wuhan. In March, Xi replied that the situation in China was improving and he called for a deepening of ties between the two nations.\nDays later, the Chinese embassy announced its donations, posting pictures on Twitter of large trucks carrying a mobile hospital that was set up within a military base near the Argentine capital.\n“China will continue to help in all possible channels. Long live friendship!” the embassy said on Twitter.\nThe help came at a difficult time for Argentina, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis and re-negotiating $110 billion in foreign debt with creditors, including the International Monetary Fund.\n“This is part of the link we have with China, which is a solid relationship of mutual respect and ties that go beyond strong trade,” a spokesman for Argentina’s foreign ministry told Reuters, when asked about the donations.\nChina’s aid to Latin America reflects a broader global trend, as Beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. Instead, China wants to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic, experts say.\nLuo Zhaohui, a vice minister at China’s foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that the country would “ride out the storm with people from other countries, strengthen cooperation and strive to win the last victory in the fight against the virus.”\nWhile Trump has been criticized by opponents for branding the pandemic ‘the Chinese virus,’ China has won praise among Latin American governments that have accepted its help. The Chinese government said it has supplied test kits, protective suits and other forms of medical aid to more than 80 countries and international organizations.\n“It’s remarkable and a credit, in a way, to China’s own commanding control of information that it’s been able to re-envision itself as a leader in the fight against coronavirus globally,” said Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue.\nMyers said the recent re-start of Chinese industry, as cases have subsided, has enabled the country to be a provider of key products as the rest of the world’s production slows.\n“This will create opportunities for China in the coming years,” she said.\nThe United States, meanwhile, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus, with the World Health Organization warning on Tuesday that the country could become a new epicenter of the crisis.\nBefore the epidemic hit hardest, Washington in February pledged $100 million towards international efforts in combating COVID-19, including for developing nations. A regional breakdown of that funding was not immediately available.\nIn Latin America, China’s hands-on approach has been well received.\nChile, which has among the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the region, has sought advice from Chinese health officials to guide its response and is sending an air force plane to China to pick up donated supplies, including tests and respiratory equipment, Chile’s health minister said.\nIn Mexico, officials have said they are awaiting 300 ventilators from China, crucial yet scarce equipment in treating patients, while in Panama, government health officials heralded a video conference with Chinese experts to work on strategy, something China has done with more than 100 countries.\nIn Venezuela, the government of President Nicolas Maduro said China would send protective gear for health professionals and coronavirus test kits. The country has also opened talks with China over possible financial support.\n“Thank you China for cooperation and solidarity with Ecuador!” the country’s Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner wrote on Twitter, itemizing help from China that he said included 40,000 surgical masks, infrared thermometers, and protective suits.\nIn Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has moved quickly to heal a diplomatic rift with China and Chinese officials have said Beijing would assist with medical supplies and technical assistance.\nChinese firms, including Alibaba (BABA.N), Huawei, COFCO, China Communications Construction and the Bank of China have pledged donations around the region.\nBack in Argentina, Washington is keen to show that it also wants to help.\n“We plan this week to make funds available to Argentine authorities to combat coronavirus,” an official at the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires told Reuters, adding the country was “looking at the possibility of additional donations.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The Trump administration cut staff by more than two-thirds at a key U.S. public health agency operating inside China, as part of a larger rollback of U.S.-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has learned.\nMost of the reductions were made at the Beijing office of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and occurred over the past two years, according to public CDC documents viewed by Reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown.\nThe Atlanta-based CDC, America’s preeminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. It has worked in China for 30 years.\nThe CDC’s China headcount has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the documents show. The four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals.\nThe material  reviewed by Reuters shows a breakdown of how many American and local Chinese employees were assigned there. The documents are the CDC’s own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. Reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people.\n“The CDC office in Beijing is a shell of its former self,” said one of the people, a U.S. official who worked in China at the time of the drawdown.\nSeparately, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the global relief program which had a role in helping China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their Beijing offices on Trump’s watch. Before the closures, each office was staffed by a U.S. official. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA) transferred out of China in 2018 the manager of an animal disease monitoring program.\nReductions at the U.S. agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help China mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the U.S. government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. The Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to assist.\n“We had a large operation of experts in China who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,” said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of U.S. personnel. “You have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.”\nThe White House declined to comment or respond to questions from Reuters regarding the U.S withdrawal of staff in China.\nThe CDC did not respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters about the cuts. It has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the U.S. response to the coronavirus.\n“There are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,” the CDC said in a statement.\nSome health experts were skeptical that more CDC employees operating inside China would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. Beijing has been widely criticized for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.\n“The problem was China, not that we didn’t have CDC people in China,” said Scott McNabb, a former CDC epidemiologist who is now a research professor with Emory University. He pointed to China’s censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy.\nChina’s embassy in Washington, D.C. declined to comment.\nThe NSF closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman Robert Margetta. He said the agency planned on “sending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.”\nA USAID spokesman said the decision to shutter its Beijing office was “due to significantly decreased access to Chinese government officials as well as the Agency’s position that the Chinese model of development is not aligned with U.S. values and interests.”\nThe USDA confirmed that it moved a manager position out of Beijing. A spokesman said the department has retained an office in China that employs eight people: five Americans and three Chinese. The office monitors animal disease and helps resolve “trade-related issues as they occur at Chinese ports of entry,” the spokesman said.\nReuters first reported about changes to CDC staffing in China on Sunday. The news agency revealed that the Trump administration had eliminated the position of a U.S. trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nIn a press briefing on Sunday, Trump criticized the Reuters story as “100 percent wrong.” Yet the CDC acknowledged the position had been cut. The agency said the decision was made because of China’s “excellent technical capability,” and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the U.S. effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe CDC staffing documents newly reviewed by Reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in Beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost.\nThe documents show the breakdown between American and Chinese staffers. The number of so-called American “assignees” declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. Positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious diseases.\nThe biggest cuts were to positions filled by Chinese employees on the U.S. payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. Many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with Reuters.\n“Local staffers stayed even longer at the CDC and had a real depth of knowledge,” one of the people said. “There’s a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.”\nThe CDC told Reuters the three Americans currently on staff in China are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. A temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. In addition, two Chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training program, according to the statement.\nThe shuttered USAID and NSF offices in China also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation.\nUSAID’s Beijing office, which was staffed by a senior U.S. officer and two Chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. The office closed in 2019.\nThe NSF office was once led by Nancy Sung, a respected American scientist who was a key link between the U.S. and Chinese scientific communities, according to the U.S. government official who spoke with Reuters. The office also employed two local staffers.\n“She had far more contacts than most of us,” said the official, who had been in China at the time and was familiar with her role. “She could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.”\nSung, who is now with the NSF in the United States, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency’s public affairs office.\nThe changes came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has long complained that China has stolen millions of American jobs and intellectual property, charges the Chinese government has rejected as baseless. The countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other’s goods. Now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. Trump has called it the “Chinese virus” to keep the focus on China’s role in unleashing the pandemic. China, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to Italy and other hard-hit countries.\nOver the last two years, the White House has pushed U.S. agencies with a presence in China to de-fund programs there along with the positions to manage them, according to the U.S. official who spoke to Reuters.\nThe source said Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former Republican governor of Iowa, tried to remind the White House of the importance of the U.S. presence in China but was told to “get with the program” by an administration official.\n“The White House saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the U.S.,” the source said.\nA State Department spokesman said in a statement that the U.S. Embassy in China is “one of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement.”\n“Since Ambassador Branstad’s arrival, the U.S. Mission to China has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the American people,” the statement said. “Staffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.”\nAfter Reuters’ story about the elimination of the key CDC position in China ran on Sunday, Trump’s re-election campaign seized on it for fundraising. In a mass email to supporters, it accused Trump’s critics of “siding with the Chinese” and helping Beijing with a “cover-up.”\nThe CDC on Monday told Reuters that Redfield had decided to add a global health threats program director to its China staff.\n“At the request of Dr. Redfield, CDC is continuing to look long term at possible additions to enhance CDC’s 30 plus year presence in China,” the statement said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "华盛顿（路透社）-路透社获悉，特朗普政府将在中国境内运营的一家美国重要公共卫生机构的工作人员裁减了三分之二以上，这是美国资助的卫生和科学专家在中国当地导致冠状病毒爆发的更大规模回退的一部分。\n根据路透社查阅的美国疾病预防控制中心（CDC）北京办事处的公开文件以及对4名知情人士的采访，大部分削减是在过去两年内进行的。\n总部位于亚特兰大的疾病预防控制中心是美国最杰出的疾病防治机构，它向世界各国提供公共卫生援助，并与它们合作，帮助阻止传染病的爆发在全球蔓延。它在中国已经工作了30年。\n文件显示，自2017年1月唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）总统上任以来，中国疾控中心在华员工人数已从约47人缩减至约14人。这4名不愿透露姓名的人士说，这些损失包括流行病学家和其他卫生专业人员。\n路透社审查的材料显示，有多少美国和当地的中国雇员被分配到那里。这些文件是疾控中心自己对其员工数量的描述，并在网上发布。路透社能够搜索过去的材料副本，以证实这四人所描述的下降。\n其中一位在中国工作的美国官员说：“疾控中心驻北京办事处是它以前的一个外壳。”。\n另外，美国国家科学基金会（NSF）和美国国际开发署（USAID）在帮助中国监测和应对疫情方面发挥作用的全球救援计划也关闭了在特朗普监督下的北京办事处。在关闭之前，每个办公室都有一名美国官. 此外，美国农业部（USDA）在2018年将一个动物疾病监测项目的经理调离中国。\n据接受路透社采访的人士说，美国机构的削减使那些本可以帮助中国更早对新型冠状病毒做出反应的健康专家、科学家和其他专业人士受到排挤，同时也为美国政府提供了更多有关未来的信息。特朗普政府今年2月谴责中国审查有关疫情的信息，并阻止美国专家入境协助。\n一位目睹美军人员撤离的人士说：“我们在中国有一大批专家在本届政府期间被带回来，其中一些是在疫情爆发前几个月带回来的。”。“你必须考虑我们的撤军可能使这场灾难更可能或更难以应对。”\n白宫拒绝对路透社有关美国撤走在华工作人员的问题发表评论或作出回应。\n疾控中心没有回应路透社提出的有关削减开支的详细问题。它坚称，其人员配备水平并不妨碍美国对冠状病毒的反应。\n疾病预防控制中心在一份声明中说：“在决定人员配备时，有很多因素。\n一些卫生专家怀疑，更多在中国境内工作的疾控中心员工会对遏制疫情产生影响。北京因压制自己的公共卫生官员而受到广泛批评，这些官员警告说，一种致命的新呼吸道疾病来自中国武汉市和湖北省周边地区。\n“问题是中国，而不是我们没有疾病控制中心的人在中国，”斯科特麦克纳布说，他以前是疾病控制中心的流行病学家，现在是埃默里大学的研究教. 他指出，中国的审查制度是这一流行病蔓延的罪魁祸首，全球至少有435470人感染了这一流行病，19598人死亡，并颠覆了全球经济。\n中国驻华盛顿大使馆拒绝置评。\n据发言人罗伯特·马格塔（Robert Margetta）说，国家安全基金会在2018年关闭了所有外交办事处。他说，该机构计划“派遣团队在世界各地进行短期考察，以寻找增加国际合作的途径。”\n美国国际开发署发言人说，关闭北京办事处的决定“是因为与中国政府官员接触的机会大大减少，以及该机构的立场，即中国的发展模式与美国的价值观和利益不符”\n美国农业部证实，已将一个经理职位调离北京。一位发言人说，该部门在中国保留了一个办公室，共有八名员工：五名美国人和三名中国人。该发言人说，该办公室负责监测动物疾病，并帮助解决“中国入境口岸发生的与贸易有关的问题”。\n路透社周日首次报道了中国疾控中心人员配置的变化。这家通讯社透露，特朗普政府已经取消了一名中国野战流行病学家的美国培训师的职位，他们被部署到爆发的震中，帮助追踪、调查和控制疾病。\n在周日的新闻发布会上，特朗普批评路透社的报道是“100%错误的”。然而疾控中心承认这一立场已经被削减。该机构说，做出这一决定是因为中国的“卓越技术能力”，并说，取消这一职位并不妨碍美国应对冠状病毒疫情的努力。\n路透社最新审查的中国疾控中心人员配置文件显示，该机构在北京的员工总数急剧下降，47个职位中有33个职位流失。\n这些文件显示了美中两国员工之间的分. 所谓的美国“被派遣者”从政府成立之初的8人减少到3人。失去的职位包括医学流行病学家和其他传染病专家。\n削减幅度最大的是美国薪资中由中国员工填补的职位，从同期的40个减少到10个左右。据接受路透社采访的人士说，许多当地雇员包括医疗和疾病专家。\n其中一位知情人士说：“当地的工作人员在疾控中心呆的时间甚至更长，知识也非常渊博。”。“缺乏深厚的专业知识和机构知识。”\n疾控中心告诉路透社，目前在华工作的三名美国人分别是国家主任、流感专家和信息技术专家。该机构在一份声明中说，一名临时副局长最近抵达，这一职位将被永久填补。此外，根据声明，两名中国工作人员继续在具体的公共卫生领域工作，包括培训项目。\n据四位知情人士透露，关闭的美国国际开发署（USAID）和美国国家科学基金会（NSF）驻华办事处在建立科学关系和抗击全球疾病方面也发挥了作用。\n知情人士说，美国国际开发署驻北京办事处由一名美国高级官员和两名中国雇员组成，正在制定包括耐多药结核病和疟疾在内的举措。办公室于2019年关闭。\n接受路透社采访的美国政府官员称，NSF办公室曾由备受尊敬的美国科学家南希·宋（Nancy Sung）领导，她是美国和中国科学界之间的关键纽带。该办公室还雇用了两名当地工作人员。\n这位官员说：“她和我们大多数人的接触都要多得多，”她当时在中国，对自己的角色很熟悉。“她本可以帮助保持两国间重要的沟通渠道，但到今天为止，这一渠道已大大减.”\n目前在美国国家科学基金会任职的宋美龄拒绝就其办公室在2018年关闭发表评论，并将问题提交给该机构的公共事务办公室。\n这些变化是在华盛顿和北京之间的紧张局势升级之际发生的。长期以来，特朗普一直抱怨中国窃取了数以百万计的美国工作和知识产权，中国政府拒绝的指控是毫无根据的。这些国家对彼此的商品征收了数十亿的关税。现在，他们的领导人正在努力控制对大流行的叙述。特朗普称之为“中国病毒”，以关注中国在引发这场流行病方面的作用。与此同时，中国正试图通过向意大利和其他遭受重创的国家提供援助来维护全球领导地位。\n据这位接受路透社采访的美国官员说，在过去两年里，白宫一直在推动在华驻扎的美国机构取消在华项目的资金来源，同时取消管理这些项目的职位。\n消息人士说，美国驻华大使、爱荷华州前共和党州长特里·布兰斯塔德（Terry Branstad）试图提醒白宫，美国在中国的存在很重要，但被一名政府官员告知“执行该计划”。\n这位消息人士说：“白宫认为中美关系是片面的，对美国没有好处。”。\n美国国务院发言人在一份声明中说，美国驻华大使馆是“我们最大的大使馆之一，反映了双边接触的许多领域”\n声明说：“自从布兰斯塔德大使抵达中国以来，美国驻华代表团一直保持强有力的人员配置，代表美国人民推进重要的外交政策目标。”。“许多联邦机构和部门的人员编制总体上保持稳定，在某些情况下有所增加。”\n路透社周日报道取消中国疾病预防控制中心的关键职位后，特朗普的连任竞选团队抓住了这个机会进行筹. 在给支持者的大量电子邮件中，它指责特朗普的批评者“站在中国一边”，帮助北京“掩盖事实”\n疾控中心周一对路透社表示，雷德菲尔德已决定在其中国员工中增加一名全球健康威胁项目主管。\n声明说：“应雷德菲尔德博士的要求，中国疾控中心将继续长期研究可能增加的项目，以增强中国疾控中心30多年的业务。”",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n* GRAPHIC: Coking coal vs spot gold: tmsnrt.rs/2QlzRMZ\nBy Clyde Russell\nLAUNCESTON, Australia, March 17 (Reuters) - Amid carnage in the oil markets, and sharp losses for other commodities such as copper, you may be tempted to think gold is the best option for a positive return. But coal beats the metal.\nCoal’s image is increasingly that of a pariah fuel, demonised by environmentalists and shunned by investors wary of its role in climate change.\nBut one of the top performing commodities this year is coking coal, the higher-quality fuel used to make steel.\nCoking coal futures on the Singapore Exchange, which mirror The Steel Index price for Australian free-on-board cargoes, ended at $159.98 a tonne on Monday, up 17.7% since the end of last year.\nIn contrast, spot gold ended at $1,513.91 an ounce on Monday, down 0.2% from end-2019, with the loss extending in Asian trade on Tuesday to around 1.5%.\nAnd it’s not just coking coal. Even thermal coal, used mainly in power plants, is looking fairly solid.\nThe weekly index price for thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port, as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, was $64.87 a tonne in the week ended March 13, virtually unchanged from the $64.85 that prevailed at the end of 2019.\nLower-quality Indonesian coal with a energy value of 4,200 kilocalories per kg was at $32.77 a tonne, down 3.1% from the end of last year.\nTo put that into perspective, global benchmark Brent crude futures dropped 54.5% from the end of last year to their close of $30.05 a barrel on Monday.\nCrude has been pummelled by a supply war breaking out between top exporter Saudi Arabia and number two Russia, after the breakdown of the agreement between OPEC and its allies to curb output to bolster prices.\nOil markets have also been hit by a demand shock, with the coronavirus pandemic spreading around the world likely to knock out several million barrels per day of consumption as the skies are emptied of planes and people stay home.\nOther commodities are also suffering, with spot Asian liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes down 35.3% from the end of last year, and London copper contracts down 14.3% over the same period.\nSo, why have both coking and thermal coal managed to stand against the economic disruption caused by the coronavirus that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, spreading around the world since then and resulting in the lockdown of cities and countries and impinging on transportation links?\nThe coronavirus itself is part of the answer, as one of China’s main sources of coking coal, neighbouring Mongolia, closed its borders in February, cutting off up to 50% of China’s supplies.\nSeasonal wet weather in Australia’s Queensland state, the source of the bulk of exports, also crimped available cargoes and led to price increases. Australia provides more than half of the global volume of coking coal exports.\nWhile China’s economy was largely shut down for much of February as part of efforts to contain the virus, it has since re-started and coking coal demand is ramping up.\nThe Mongolian border has also reopened, but Queensland is still having weather disruptions, keeping coking coal prices resilient.\nHopes that Beijing will boost stimulus measures to bolster the economy have also supported coking coal prices, as well as those for iron ore.\nBenchmark 62% iron ore MT-IO-QIN62=ARG, as assessed by Argus, ended at $90.30 a tonne on Monday, little changed from $90.15 on the last trading day of 2019.\nThermal coal also benefited from the coronavirus as Chinese mines were either idled or working at reduced rates, boosting demand for imports of the fuel.\nWith China’s mines returning to normal, there may be an easing in demand for imported cargoes, but the imports are still competitive with domestic prices, meaning traders have a profit incentive to buy from top thermal coal exporter Indonesia and number two Australia.\nPerhaps coking and thermal coal, as well as iron ore, provide an optimistic note that commodity prices can recover once the coronavirus is contained.

Rectal swab testing may be a more effective way to determine how long to quarantine children, the researchers said.\nThe only reason the 10 children - six boys and four girls ranging in age from two months to 15 years - were tested at a hospital in the city of Guangzhou was because they were family members of COVID-19 patients or had close contact with people diagnosed with the disease, not because medical care had been sought for them, the researchers said.\nFive of the children had a cough, four had a sore throat, three had diarrhea and two had nasal congestion and runny nose, symptoms that the researchers said could can make COVID-19 look like other illnesses.\n“Mild and atypical presentations of the infection in children may make it difficult to detect,” according to the study, whose lead author was Dr. Yi Xu of Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center in Guangzhou.\nIn all, 745 children deemed as “highly suspected” of being infected were screened between Jan. 22 and Feb. 20. Of that group, 1.3% were found to be infected.\nThe low ratio follows the pattern described by researchers in another study published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine in which a separate team of Chinese doctors reporting out of the city of Wuhan found that only 1.6% of respiratory infections among hospitalized children were COVID-19. The outbreak emerged last December in Wuhan and the virus has since spread to various parts of the world.\nIn this latest study, seven of the 10 children had a fever, although it was never higher than 39 degrees C (102.2 F).\nNone had the pneumonia that has made the disease deadly in some adults, although CT scans showed that five of the 10 children had isolated or multiple patchy “ground-glass” patches, usually in the outer lung fields.\nThe headache, muscle aches, nausea, lethargy, labored breathing, vomiting and disorientation that can be seen in adults who have COVID-19 were all absent in this small group of infected children, the researchers said.\nThe researchers cautioned that although the virus was persistently found in the rectal swabs of eight of the 10 children even after it had vanished from nose and throat swabs, it was not clear if the virus particles present in the feces were infectious.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Laughter they say is the best medicine. At least to beat the blues resulting from the coronavirus lockdown.\nSubtle and sharp, sarcastic and self-deprecating. And sometimes just downright rude. There are wife jokes, husband jokes, boss barbs, Modi jibes, weight gain worries and the inevitable China insults. Humour in all forms is the panacea it seems for people around the world who are united in their need to laugh or at least crack a smile in these troubled times.\nAs three billion people across the world stay indoors in a lockdown never before seen on this planet, some are sharpening their creativity and the rest are having fun with the jokes flooding in through memes, cartoons, videos, one-liners and others.And they are all going around the world in minutes, thanks to the ubiquitous social media, particularly WhatsApp.\nNo subject is out of bounds as people all over use wordplay, clever drawings and other witticisms to mirror a society, warts and all, going through its worst crisis in a century.\nOne pocket cartoon shows a bride flinging a garland at the groom on the other side of the fire. Given the threat of coronavirus, both are in masks and the priest is seated a distance away.\nAnother perhaps reflecting matrimony many years down the line has a woman, her brows knitted together as she wields a spoon over a wok, and her smiling husband slouched on the sofa watching 'Lock-down special' on TV. \"No, he is not helping at all. He just claps for me for a full 5 minutes a day,\" she complains.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi had urged people to stand on the balconies of their houses for five minutes on Sunday, March 22, at 5 pm and clap as a sign of thanks for emergency and healthcare workers.\nFrom memes featuring prominent politicians to hilarious work-from-home jokes, from bad puns to good cartoons, Indians and others have taken to Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook in a bid to tackle the stress from the spread of the virus, which has affected more than 530,000 people and claimed over 24,000 lives.\nIn India, the disease has hit more than 720 people and killed 17.\n\"Ghar se taali bajane ko bola tha, dhol manjira leke raste pe kirtan karne ko kisne bola (I had asked you to clap in your homes, who asked you to go out and celebrate while playing musical instruments),\" reads one meme.\nAnd there is this cartoon that makes fun of the new 'work-from-home' trend with panic-stricken passengers on a plane. \"This is your pilot speaking. I'm working from home today\", reads the text.\nThe work/stay at home dogma takes a swipe at the couch potato too -- a split frame of a man fast asleep on the couch with a remote in his hand and the words '2019 Lazy Bast***', and the same pic below but this time with the label '2019 Responsible Adult'.\nMany posts are quirky and slightly snide wordplays -- \"Villagers in Punjab are still wondering who the hell is Soshail Distan Singh?\", for instance, or \"Xi Jinping's message to the world: No Ming Ling\".\n\"Finally got the Hindi name of social distancing 'TAN DOORI\"', reads a WhatsApp forward breaking up word for food cooked in a tandoor to 'tan' (body) and 'doori' (distance).\nWith India under an unprecedented 21-day lockdown to curtail the spread of the disease, a meme makes a reference to India's richest man, Reliance Industries' Mukesh Ambani, and his palatial 27-storey residence Antilla in south Mumbai.\n\"Lockdown ki wajah se aaj maine pehli baar apna pur ghar dekh liya (It is because of the lockdown that I got to see my whole house for the first time)\".\nA widely-shared meme on the lockdown features former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, released from detention in Srinagar earlier this week. It shows him with his hand on his forehead and a text saying, \"When you spend 236 days in lockdown, and on the day you get out, the govt imposes 21-day national lockdown.\"\nThe meme later got approval by the National Conference leader himself, who re-tweeted it and wrote: \"These are serious & scary times so a little humour doesn't hurt\".\nAnd then there is this one that says, \"My body has absorbed so much soap and disinfectant lately that when I pee it cleans the toilet.\"\nThere are also several posts trolling China either for allegedly spreading the virus to other countries or its peculiar eating habits.\n\"Ek toh pehle China ko Jain banao (Firstly, make Chinese residents follow Jainism),\" tweeted one Karan Sitlani, referring to the vegetarianism of the Jain community.\nAnother Whatsapp forward takes a jibe at the Chinese products, \"Coronavirus won't last long because it was made in China\".\nThe novel coronavirus, which originated in the central Hubei province of China in December, according to two recent studies published in the journal Nature, may have originated from bats.\nVideos are making their point too.\nOne doing the rounds has a wife telling her husband to call the house help because she hasn't come for three days. The man calls her only to be told that she is working from home and will tell him what needs to be cleaned in his home -- overturning the class dynamic while stressing that coronavirus affects everyone.\nAnother has a father trying to put his crying child to sleep. All it takes is his sternly calling out to 'corona' and the child is quickly silenced.\nSometimes it is just savage and dark. Like this one-liner, doing the social media rounds, which says, \"We can meet in May if all stay put at home or shall meet in heaven\".\nOr this one, \"Dear God, please reboot 2020. It has a virus\".\nAnd, of course, as in all kinds of humour, some jokes are sexist and racist too, using tired tropes. Humour, sometimes good and sometimes tired, can be infectious too. And as the world waits for this crisis to end, people all over can say -- just bring the smiles on.\n",

That means 86 per cent of the people with significant symptoms because remember you had to have a fever and symptoms to get tested at this point. So still 86 per cent are negative,\" she said.\nThese are really important facts for the American people, Dr Brix said.\nShe was critical of some of the modelling studies which had said that there would be 500,000 deaths in the UK and 2.2 million deaths in the US.\n\"They have adjusted that number in the UK to 20,000. Half a million to 20,000.

        "news_content_translate_en": "As of March 28, less than three months after the world was made aware of the novel coronavirus, 600,000 people across 177 countries/regions have been infected with it. The infection which reportedly originated from a market in Wuhan city in the Chinese province of Hubei, has claimed more than 27,800 lives.\nWith nations entering lockdown in an effort to 'flatten the curve' of social interactions by means of social distancing, it is very important to refrain from placing one's beliefs in any miraculous cures or conspiracy theories about COVID-19. Here are some widely shared myths about the novel coronavirus that stand nowhere on the scale of scientific relevance.\nThis is a myth. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has observed that this infection can be transmitted in any and all areas regardless of climate.\nThis is not true. While wearing a mask in a crowded place is advisable, the mask cannot prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus. In some cases where the person wearing the mask touches an infected surface before touching his/her face to re-adjust the mask, this protective gear could lead to infection, said the Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria.\nThis is a myth. The normal body temperature remains stable between 36.5°C to 37°C despite the temperature of one's bath, says the WHO.\nThere is no evidence whatsoever to prove this claim. While alcohol-based hand sanitizers are a recommended precaution against any virus, drinking alcohol while seeking to cure Covid-19 is the same as drinking alcohol-based hand sanitizer and expecting it to taste like a pint of beer.\nIt has been established that the novel coronavirus jumped species from an animal to a man and is originally a zoonotic disease. However, no known animal species has been known to carry this virus as of yet and medical experts have asked people not to believe in rumours and eat non-vegetarian meals as long as they are prepared with utmost care for hygiene.\nThis is a myth. Dr Faheem Younus, the Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland says that a person infected with the novel coronavirus can also hold his/her breath for longer than 10 seconds. On the other hand, the elderly will not be able to accomplish this task but it does not in any way mean that they are infected.\nDirector of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria says that one should not visit a hospital during a pandemic since it increases the chances of a healthy person catching the virus. One should consult a doctor over the phone if he/she is experiencing any symptoms at all and seek future course of action.\nThis is a myth. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that the consumption of garlic boosts the immunity system or safeguards one from being infected with Covid-19.\nThis is untrue. One should not donate blood at a time like this unless and until one is absolutely sure that he/she is not infected.\nThis is a myth. No study or research has shown that mosquitoes can act as carriers of the novel coronavirus. \"The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose,\" says WHO.\nThese are myths. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one should regularly wash one's hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Apart from this, neither a hand dryer nor an ultraviolet disinfection lamp can kill the virus.\nThis is a myth. Pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine cannot protect anyone from Covid-19 since the vaccine for the new coronavirus is yet to be discovered.\nThis is untrue. While some preliminary research has shown that the novel coronavirus remains on certain surfaces such as cardboard for some time, it cannot spread through parcels received from China.\nThis is not entirely true. A thermal scanner detects body temperature and is great for identifying someone with a high fever, however, medical experts and doctors treating Covid-19 patients have said that initial research shows how people who display no symptoms can also be infected with the virus.\nThis is untrue. The transmission of novel coronavirus has been seen in people of all ages. Doctors suggest that people with co-morbid conditions such as blood pressure, heart or respiratory diseases are at a higher risk if they get infected with Covid-19. However, a perfectly healthy person can also be infected in the presence of a Covid-19 patient.\n",

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\nThis was what legendary Chinese strategist Sun Tzu said in his the Art of War in the times when Gautam Buddha was preaching good ways of life in India.\nNow replace the word 'enemy' in the opening paragraph with novel coronavirus and read the three sentences again. This new enemy has emerged from China and brought the whole world to its knees. It needs to be fought with full might.\nThis fact cannot be overstated that the world - as individuals, agencies and the governments - needs to have full clarity about novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, a disease that turns certain existing ailments into killer ones.\nNovel coronavirus itself is not a new virus. It is believed to have been living peacefully in its host, bats, the mammal cousins of humans. Some time in November last year, this novel coronavirus - now officially named SARS-CoV-2 or sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 - made the journey from bats through some intermediary animal to humans in Chinese business hub of Wuhan.\nNow, novel coronavirus is a human virus. And, it is a new virus for human body. The novel coronavirus being new means the body does not know the mechanism how to fight this unknown enemy. It also means there is no readily available medicine to nutralise novel coronavirus in human body.\nMedical science, the unique power of well-being, is using all its skills and might to come out with a solution. Now, there is at least some understanding about how this new virus behaves.\nAccording to a newly published paper, the novel coronavirus lives longer on some surfaces such as plastic and steel more than other, say cardboard or copper. Knowing stability of novel coronavirus is important to understand its virility or its ability to infect a healthy person.\nBut on a copper surface, no viable novel coronavirus could be found during the study after four hours. This means copper utensils and door knobs are safer than those made up of plastic or steel.\nOn cardboards used for packaging most of the items we order online, the novel coronavirus does not stay viable for more than 24 hours. This means your online orders in most cases are safe unless the delivery boy had the infection and sneezed on it.\nSome other studies have found that novel coronavirus remains suspended in air in the form of droplets - called aerosols -- formed through sneezing and coughing. The usual time of suspension is about 30 minutes. But they can stay suspended for up to two hours. Gravity brings them down and the chances of the novel coronavirus trapped inside those droplets entering a human's respiratory tract get reduced to minimum this way.\nHowever, in some cases, the novel coronavirus containing aerosols have travelled up to the ventilator of isolation wards of the Covid-19 patients. This is against the hitherto held view that novel coronavirus does not travel through air.\nTo believe that novel coronavirus does not travel through air and start falling could be misleading. This puts health workers at greater risk if they are attending to novel coronavirus patients.\nThis also means healthy people visiting hospitals without adequate protective gear are at the risk of contracting the novel coronavirus and become a vector of Covid-19 even if they don't immediately show symptoms.\nTo put it in simpler words, it is important to remember that touch is not the only way to get infected by novel coronavirus. Since people cannot stay long without breathing, visiting such places where novel coronavirus laden aerosols are suspended, falling or travelling in air can make a healthy person a Covid-19 patient.\nThe good part is that the scientists working on the novel coronavirus have found that the contagion in such aerosols loses its ability to infect very fast. And, even a 10-minute time lag reduces the chances of spread significantly.\nAvoiding this enemy is the key.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The global economy is already in a recession as the hit to economic activity from the coronavirus pandemic has become more widespread, according to economists polled by Reuters amid a raft of central bank stimulus actions this week.\nThe spread of the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19, has sent financial markets into a tailspin despite some of the biggest emergency stimulus measures since the global financial crisis announced by dozens of central banks across Europe, the Americas, Asia and Australia.\nThe panic was clear in stocks, bonds, gold and commodity prices, underlining expectations of severe economic damage from the outbreak.\nMore than three-quarters of economists based in the Americas and Europe polled this week, 31 of 41, said the current global economic expansion had already ended, in response to a question about whether the global economy was already in recession.\n\"Last week we concluded that the COVID-19 shock would produce a global recession as nearly all of the world contracts over the three months between February and April,\" noted Bruce Kasman, head of global economic research at JP Morgan.\n\"There is no longer doubt that the longest global expansion on record will end this quarter. The key outlook issue now is gauging the depth and the duration of the 2020 recession.\"\nEconomists have repeatedly cut their growth outlook over the past month and have increased their forecast probabilities for recession in most major economies.\nThe worst-case views on growth taken just weeks ago in some cases have already into the central scenario for private sector economists in Reuters polls.\n\"The evolving news on COVID-19 has triggered forecast leap frogging,’ with economists and strategists repeatedly lowering their forecasts. Among the big three economies, the US and the euro area will see negative growth, while Chinese growth is expected to come in at a paltry 1.5 per cent,\" said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at BofA.\n\"Our first piece on the virus shock was titled bad or worse’; now we amend that to 'really bad or much worse.' We now expect COVID-19 to cause a global recession in 2020, of similar magnitude to the recessions of 1982 and 2009.\"\nThe global economy was forecast to expand 1.6 per cent this year, about half the 3.1per cent predicted in the January poll, and the weakest since the global financial crisis of 2007-09.\nForecasts for 2020 global GDP ranged from -2.0% to +2.7 per cent.\n\"As cases of coronavirus spiral upward, disruptions to the global economy are increasing. We have cut our global GDP growth forecast to 1.25 per cent for the year - less severe than the deep recessions of 1981-82 and 2008-09, but worse than the mild recessions of 1991 and 2001,\" noted Goldman Sachs’ economics research team.\n\"Consistent with this, our economists now expect recessions in Europe, Japan, Canada and possibly the United States.\"\nThe US economy was almost certain to enter a recession this year, if it is not in one already, according to a poll published on Thursday and taken after the Federal Reserve’s emergency move on Sunday.\n\"The US economy is going to have a shock from this coronavirus and I think that there’s still a lot of uncertainty around the size and the depth and the prolonged period of the shock,\" said Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at Pacific Investment Management Co (PIMCO).\n\"We’re still getting our heads wrapped around that. We think it’s quite likely that the US has a small technical recession this year.\"\nAs for the world’s second largest economy, China, where the virus outbreak originated, a Reuters poll published on March 6 showed the outlook was once again cut significantly for this quarter, next quarter, and for 2020.\nSince then, economists have been slashing their forecasts even more.\nThe economic damage from the outbreak was predicted to reverberate through other major economies in Asia too, with most forecast to slow significantly, halt or shrink outright in the current quarter according to a February 26 Reuters poll.\nJapan’s economy, which already contracted sharply toward the end of 2019, was expected to grow only 0.1 per cent in the new fiscal year that begins in April, a March 6 Reuters survey found, revised down from 0.5 per cent projected in February.\nFollowing the rapid spread of virus infections from China to other countries, including Europe, the risk of a euro zone recession doubled in a poll taken earlier this month.\nIt was not very different for the UK, where the Bank of England cut rates to near-zero on Thursday and re-started its asset purchases.\nThe British economy was expected to expand 0.1 per cent this quarter and then contract 0.3% next quarter, a sharp revision from the 0.3 per cent expansion they had expected before for both the quarters in the previous poll.\nIn a worst case scenario, the economy was forecast to contract 1.0 per cent next quarter and by 0.7% in 2020. Forecasts were as low as -5.0 per cent and -3.0 per cent, respectively, with no economist expecting growth in either period in the worst case.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "路透社（Reuters）本周对经济学家进行的一系列刺激措施的调查显示，随着冠状病毒疫情对经济活动的影响变得更加广泛，全球经济已经陷入衰退。\n尽管欧洲、美洲、亚洲和澳大利亚数十家央行宣布了全球金融危机以来规模最大的一些紧急刺激措施，但由病毒COVID-19引起的疾病蔓延已使金融市场陷入低谷。\n股市、债券、黄金和大宗商品价格的恐慌情绪十分明显，突显出市场对疫情造成严重经济损失的预期。\n本周接受调查的美国和欧洲经济学家中，超过四分之三（41人中的31人）表示，针对全球经济是否已经陷入衰退的问题，当前全球经济扩张已经结束。\n摩根大通（JP Morgan）全球经济研究主管布鲁斯•卡斯曼（Bruce Kasman）指出：“上周，我们得出结论，由于2月至4月之间的三个月内几乎所有国家都在收缩，COVID-19冲击将导致全球衰退。”。\n“毫无疑问，有史以来最长的全球扩张将在本季度结束。现在的关键展望问题是衡量2020年衰退的深度和持续时间。”\n过去一个月，经济学家一再下调经济增长预期，并提高了对大多数主要经济体衰退的预测概率。\n就在几周前，在某些情况下，对经济增长的最坏看法已经成为路透调查中私营部门经济学家的核心观点。\n“COVID-19不断变化的消息引发了预测的跳跃式增长，”经济学家和策略师们一再下调预测。在三大经济体中，美国和欧元区将出现负增长，而中国的经济增长预计仅为微不足道的美国银行（BofA）全球经济主管伊桑•哈里斯（Ethan Harris）表示。\n“我们关于病毒冲击的第一篇文章的标题是“坏或更糟”；现在我们将其修改为“真的坏或更糟”。我们现在预计，COVID-19将在2020年造成全球衰退，其规模与1982年和2009年的衰退相似。”\n据预测，今年全球经济将增长1.6%，约为1月份民调预测的3.1%的一半，也是2007-2009年全球金融危机以来最疲弱的一年。\n对2020年全球GDP的预测从-2.0%到+2.7%不等。\n“随着冠状病毒病例的螺旋上升，全球经济受到的干扰也在增加。高盛（Goldman Sachs）经济研究团队指出：“我们已将今年全球GDP增长预测下调至1.25%——低于1981-82年和2008-09年的深度衰退，但低于1991年和2001年的轻度衰退。”。\n“与此一致，我们的经济学家现在预计欧洲、日本、加拿大可能还有美国将出现衰退。”\n上周四公布的一项民调显示，美国经济今年几乎肯定会进入衰退，如果还没有进入衰退的话，这项民调是在美联储（Federal Reserve）周日采取紧急行动后进行的。\n太平洋投资管理公司（PIMCO）北美经济学家蒂凡尼·怀丁说：“美国经济将受到这种冠状病毒的冲击，我认为，冲击的规模、深度和持续时间仍有很大的不确定性。”。\n“我们还在想办法。我们认为，美国今年很可能出现一场小型的技术衰退。”\n至于全球第二大经济体、病毒爆发地中国，路透社3月6日公布的一项民调显示，本季度、下季度和2020年的经济前景再次大幅下调。\n从那以后，经济学家们更是大幅下调了他们的预.\n据路透社2月26日的一项民调显示，此次疫情造成的经济损失预计也将波及亚洲其他主要经济体，多数经济体预计本季度经济将大幅放缓、停止或彻底萎缩。\n路透社（Reuters）3月6日的一项调查发现，日本经济在接近2019年底时已经大幅收缩，预计在4月份开始的新财年，日本经济增长率仅为0.1%，低于2月份预计的0.5%。\n随着病毒感染从中国迅速传播到包括欧洲在内的其他国家，本月早些时候进行的一项民调显示，欧元区经济衰退的风险增加了一倍。\n对英国来说，情况并没有太大不同，英国央行（boe）周四将利率降至接近零的水平，并重新开始购买资产。\n英国经济本季度预计将增长0.1%，下季度则收缩0.3%，与此前两个季度的0.3%相比，这一增幅有了大幅修正。\n在最坏的情况下，预计下一季度经济将萎缩1.0%，2020年将萎缩0.7%。预测值分别低至-5.0%和-3.0%，在最坏的情况下，没有经济学家预计这两个时期的经济增长",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In a matter of days, millions of Americans have seen their lives upended by measures to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\nNormally bustling streets are deserted as families hunker down in their homes. Many of those who do venture out try to stay a safe distance from anyone they encounter, even as they line up to buy now-precious commodities like hand sanitizer. Parents juggle childcare as schools close, perhaps for the rest of the school year. And restaurants and bars sit empty as more and more convert to delivery-only options.\nHow long will this last? Scientists say there isn't a simple answer.\n\"In many ways, this situation is unprecedented - we're trying to take some actions to curb the spread and timing of this pandemic,\" said Stephen Morse, a disease researcher at Columbia University in New York.\nYes, there have been past disease outbreaks that scientists can draw some lessons from but, in those cases, the disease was largely allowed to run its course. \"So those models don't precisely apply,\" Morse said.\nMONTHS-LONG BATTLE\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. may be managing the outbreak through July or August. And New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state's number of coronavirus cases may peak - not end - in 45 days.\nThe overall message is that the country will be fighting the virus outbreak for a matter of months, at least, not days or weeks.\nEach model of how the disease could spread relies on data and assumptions about population dynamics, demographics, health care capacity and other factors, said Rebecca Katz, a public health expert at Georgetown University.\nThe challenge for designing models of what will happen next in the U.S. is that limited testing for COVID-19 means researchers don't know what the starting point is - how many people are already infected.\nIn simplest terms, scientists say that the epidemic will slow when people with infections don't pass the virus on to others.\n\"Basically, if I infect one other person or more ... then the epidemic can take off. If I infect less than one person and everybody infects less than one person, then the epidemic will decline,\" said Elizabeth Halloran, a disease researcher at the University of Washington.\nBased on data from China and from cruise ships, scientists estimate that unless measures are taken to limit the spread, each infected person will infect about 2 or 3 others, leading to an exponential growth of the virus.\nIf the virus makes a jump to new person every two to five days, as scientists calculate, then a single infected person could lead to 4,142 total infections within a month - assuming nothing is done to break chains of transmission.\nUnless such measures are put in place, scientists estimate that between 40 and 80% of the global population could become infected. Based on an analysis of data from China, scientists found that the majority of new infections are transmitted by people with mild symptoms who may not even know they're ill, said Jeffrey Shaman, a public health expert at Columbia University.\nEven if most people recover and only a fraction of total infections are severe enough to require hospitalization - about 14%, scientists estimate - the sheer scale of the epidemic will put enormous strain on hospitals, healthcare workers and other patients who may see unrelated procedures delayed.\nScientists now agree that measures to break or slow the chains of transmission are crucial to ensure that emergency rooms aren't quickly overwhelmed by surges in critically ill patients.\nIf measures like closing schools are successful in slowing disease spread, \"we are going to see a hump instead of a peak\" in new cases, U.S. government disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a White House briefing.\nIn order words, the number of infections will rise more gradually and manageably. But that also means the duration of the outbreak will be prolonged.\n\"The point of the restrictions we have is actually to stretch this out even longer. We don't want a big peak to come very quickly,\" said Mark Jit, a disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"It's not like a Hollywood movie with a clear ending where everyone is saved, or everyone dies, quickly.\"\nHOW DOES THIS END?\nMost scientists believe the fight against COVID-19 won't be over until there's an effective vaccine. But Fauci and other experts say it will be more than a year before a vaccine can be ready for widespread use.\n\"The best-case scenario is that we have vaccine in 12 or 18 months and then our lives go back to normal,\" Jit said. \"The worst-case scenario it takes a long time for a vaccine to be developed, and the world is really changed and our lives aren't the same again.\"\nWhile we wait, are we all shut-ins for more than a year? Almost no one thinks that's realistic.\n\"I don't think we can maintain social distancing as it is right now for the duration of the epidemic,\" said Michael Levy, a University of Pennsylvania disease researcher.\nWhat may be more feasible is a plan for intermittent restrictions and enhanced monitoring to control the disease, an idea explored in a new study from researchers at Imperial College London. Once the number of new cases falls below a certain threshold, schools, offices and restaurants could reopen. But if the number of infections spikes again, restrictions would be reinstated.\n\"The analogy of pumping car brakes on an icy road is what we should be thinking about,\" Levy said. \"You push on the brakes to slow things down, then ease up - but if you skid, you have to pump the brakes again.\"\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "It is tough to avoid a global economic fallout when governments around the world are trying their best to contain raging novel coronavirus pandemic.\nMore than 1,30,000 confirmed cases have been reported while the virus has claimed over 4,500 lives. In such a scenario, a government is almost entirely focused on ways to protect citizens.\nSome hard decisions that are likely to have a long-term effect on the global economy have been taken by governments of affected nations in order to protect citizens.\nSimply put, governments have had to pass orders stopping important economic activity including tourism, trade and manufacturing, production and much more.\nThough it is not possible at the moment to calculate the total economic damage caused by Covid-19, it will have significant economic fallout, many noted experts, including International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist Gita Gopinath, have said.\nADAPT, OVERCOME\nGopinath recently wrote a blog where she mentioned that the world has suffered due to the virus, especially due to shocks in supply and demand stemming from the health crisis.\nShe goes on to say that substantial targeted policies are needed to back the economy during the course of an epidemic.\nGopinath also explains that while businesses and firms around the globe cannot escape unharmed, they should be ready to double-up and recover once the outbreak fades.\n\"The goal is to prevent a temporary crisis from permanently harming people and firms through job losses and bankruptcies,\" she wrote.\nSince there is no vaccine to contain the virus, countries have resorted to measures like travel restrictions, temporary school closures and quarantines. Gopinath said such measures can work well during the crisis and put less economic pressure on the existing health systems.\nECONOMIC IMPACT\nThe financial impact of novel coronavirus pandemic, though cannot be determined by any single economic indicator, has been widespread. The financial distress caused to China, the worst affected country that is slowly recovering, has been the biggest blow to the world.\nSeveral parts of China, which is considered the world's manufacturing hub, were put under strict restrictions when the outbreak was just identified.\nWithin a month, the death toll and the number of infected people shot up sharply. The Chinese government was forced to lock down factories, prominent stores and other brands. It led to huge economic losses around the world and was reflected in stock markets around the globe, especially Asian countries.\nMany reports predicted that global GDP would take a massive hit as lockdown in China would lead to large-scale supply disruptions.\n\"The economic impact is already visible in the countries most affected by the outbreak. For example, in China, manufacturing and service sector activity declined dramatically in February. While the drop in manufacturing is comparable to the start of the global financial crisis, the decline in services appears larger this time-reflecting the large impact of social distancing,\" Gopinath explained.\nIn her blogpost, the IMF chief economist warned about the financial effects and spillovers due to the Covid-19 pandemic. There could be a rise in borrowing costs and financial conditions could also tighten.\nSince most countries around the world will face economic shock at the same time, the economic impact of the virus could take a turn for the worse.\nHOW TO LIMIT FALLOUT\nWhile it is not possible to completely avoid the economic fallout caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, the IMF chief economist said targeted economic policies will be needed to shore up economies after the outbreak fades.\n\"Considering that the economic fallout reflects particularly acute shocks in specific sectors, policymakers will need to implement substantial targeted fiscal, monetary, and financial market measures to help affected households and businesses,\" Gopinath opined.\nShe goes on to say that households and businesses hit by supply disruptions could be \"targeted to receive cash transfers, wage subsidies, and tax relief\" to help them meet daily needs and sustain businesses.\nGiving an example of crisis-hit Italy, Gopinath said the country has extended tax deadlines for companies in affected areas and broadened the wage supplementation fund to provide income support to workers who have been fired due to the virus outbreak.\nKorea, meanwhile, has introduced wage subsidies for all small merchants and increased allowances for homecare and job seekers. China, for the time being, has waived social security contributions for businesses.\nGopinath said that central banks should also be ready to provide \"ample liquidity\" to banks and NBFCs, especially those who lend to small and medium-sized enterprises. Such enterprises are usually not prepared to deal with a health crisis of such magnitude.\n\"Governments could offer temporary and targeted credit guarantees for the near-term liquidity needs of these firms. For example, Korea has expanded lending for business operations and loan guarantees for affected small- and medium-sized enterprises,\" she wrote\n\"Financial market regulators and supervisors could also encourage, on a temporary and time-bound basis, extensions of loan maturities.\"\nGopinath also recommended broader monetary stimulus such as policy rate cuts or asset purchases, both of which can boost confidence and support financial markets.\nShe, however, said these broad-based fiscal relief measures, should be effective when business operations begin to normalise.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Study of positive coronavirus cases in two of the worst affected countries, China and Italy points to somewhat selective pattern of the spread of Covid-19. That the novel coronavirus targets the older people and avoids the young ones. \nSituation gets complicated leading to deaths if the elderly patient already has some medical issues such as breathing problems, diabetes, heart-related ailments and kidney problems. \nThe mean age of those succumbing to novel coronavirus in Italy was reported to be 81 last week. Italy is known as the country with old population; more than 60 per cent of its total population is over 40. This is said to have contributed to more infections and deaths in Italy than places such as South Korea or even Japan.\nChina too is considered a country of aging peopulation. This refers to share of elderly people (above 60) crossing 10 per cent in the total population. China's elderly (above 60) are more than 17 per cent in its total population. Incidentally in China, the Centre for Disease Control reached a similar conclusion as Italy after examining over 72,000 cases that the disease is deadlier in older people. This is also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn India, all the three deaths due to novel coronavirus infection have happened in the cases of elderly patients. The youngest of them was 64. All had previous medical conditions.\nTwo main reasons have been attributed to this age specific coronavirus spread pattern. First, it is a medical fact that immunity is strongest in childhood and decreases with advancement in age. DNA, the genetic material that guides most functions of human body, is agile in childhood and responds quicker to alien particles entering the body. This boosts immunity. With advancement of age, the DNA messaging gets corrupted and the right message to disease fighting cells are not delivered efficiently.\nSecondly, in most countries, coronavirus testing are symptomatic in process. That is, only those showing synonyms are being tested for novel coronavirus infection. This means a number of children may be passing off without being tested for novel coronavirus. \nWith stronger immunity, children may not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection even if they have contracted the contagion. Untested children means more adults entering the records and hence further skew in the final data.\nThis does not mean that children are completely immune to novel coronavirus infection. At two cases -- one each from China and the UK -- were reported about newborns having tested positive for novel coronavirus. Though, the disease Covid-19 has not been found to be transferring from mother to child during pregnancy. A three-year-old child tested positive for Covid-19 in India. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in India.\nBut the fact that children are largely untested underscores that they can be carriers or vectors of novel coronavirus. Also, medical conditions like asthma and diabetes are not uncommon among children. In many cases obesity-linked diabetes and asthma are related. In such cases, novel coronavirus infection can be fatal for children.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Policymakers and government leaders have taken a range of approaches to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Here is a list of how some of the world's biggest economies and economic blocs have reacted.\nUNITED STATES\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday instructed the U.S. Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted, saying it would provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.\nTrump also said he was ordering the Small Business Administration to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus by providing low-interest loans to small businesses in affected states and territories, effective immediately. And he suspended all travel from Europe, with a few exceptions, to the United States for 30 days starting on Friday.\nEarlier, Trump signed a $8.3 billion emergency spending bill to combat the spread of the virus and develop vaccines for the highly contagious disease.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates by half a percentage point in its first emergency rate move since the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Investors expect more cuts in the weeks ahead.\nCHINA\nChina said it had earmarked 110.5 billion yuan ($15.9 billion) to fight the epidemic.\nBeijing has ramped up funding support for virus-hit regions and the country's central bank has cut several of its key rates, including the benchmark lending rate, and has urged banks to give cheap loans and payment relief to exposed companies.\nChina will modify the environmental supervision of companies to help the resumption of production disrupted by the coronavirus epidemic, giving firms more time to rectify environmental problems.\nJAPAN\nJapan unveiled a second package of measures worth about $4 billion in spending to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, focusing on support to small and mid-sized firms, as concerns mount about risks to the fragile economy.\nSeparately, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has pledged to pump more liquidity into markets and step up asset buying.\nJapan's central bank may also take steps to ensure companies hit by the coronavirus outbreak do not face a financial squeeze before the end of the current fiscal year in March, according to sources familiar with the central bank's thinking.\nEUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nThe ECB, the central bank of the euro zone, has so far avoided cutting interest rates. Policymakers did hold an unscheduled meeting on March 3 but it was to discuss operational responses to coronavirus, such as whether to hold events and staff shortages, rather than any policy response, sources close to the matter said.\nThe ECB has asked euro zone banks to review their business continuity plans and the actions they can take to prepare for and minimize the potential adverse effects of the coronavirus, a letter seen by Reuters shows.\nTHE EUROPEAN UNION\nEuropean Union leaders have so far failed to agree radical measures to tackle the crisis. The head of the bloc's executive Ursula von der Leyen said the European Commission will set up a joint investment fund with firepower of 25 billion euros ($28 billion) from existing resources to cushion the blow to vulnerable sectors of the bloc's economies.\nGERMANY\nGermany's centre-left coalition agreed to increase public investments by 12.4 billion euros by 2024 and to make it easier for companies to claim subsidies to support workers on reduced working hours to counter the effects of the coronavirus epidemic.\nChancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are split over whether Germany should rush out a fiscal stimulus package to counter any impact of the coronavirus on Europe's largest economy.\nBudget experts estimate the government has the fiscal room for additional measures worth at least 17 billion euros ($18.9 billion). Some officials say that Berlin could even put together a stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros, without ditching the government's policy of no new debt.\nBRITAIN\nBritain launched a 30 billion-pound ($39 billion) economic stimulus plan just hours after the Bank of England slashed interest rates, a double-barrelled package aimed at warding off the risk of a coronavirus recession.\nThe Bank of England cut interest rates by half a percentage point and offered banks cheaper funding and a reduction in capital buffers in an emergency move to bolster Britain's economy against disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFRANCE\nFrench Finance Minister Bruno Le Marie has said that Europe needs to be ready to use fiscal stimulus to deal with the impact of the coronavirus.\nThe government is allowing companies to suspend payments of some social charges and taxes, and is activating state-subsidised short-time work schemes. It has ordered the Bpifrance state investment bank to guarantee loans needed to overcome short-term cashflow problems.\nParis has also allowed companies to declare force majeure due to the outbreak if they cannot honor a contract with the public sector, and is putting pressure on big companies to show similar leniency with subcontractors.\nINDIA\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to infuse fresh cash liquidity into the system through a second round of long-term repo operations (LTRO), government officials told Reuters, amid fears that the coronavirus outbreak will derail any revival of economic growth. One official said the RBI might inject as much as 1 trillion rupees ($13.6 billion) in the round that will begin as early as April.\nThe RBI has said it stands ready to act to maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability.\nThe government is, meanwhile, pushing state-run banks to approve new loans amounting to 500-600 billion rupees by the end of March, according to government sources.\nITALY\nItaly has doubled the amount it plans to spend on tackling its coronavirus outbreak to 7.5 billion euros ($8.4 billion) and is raising this year's deficit goal to 2.5% of national output from the current 2.2% target.\nPayments on mortgages will be suspended across the whole of Italy and Italy's banking lobby ABI said lenders would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout from the virus.\nCANADA\nFinance Minister Bill Morneau said on March 9 that the government was \"looking at taking some initiatives this week,\" as Canada reported its first coronavirus death, with a steep decline in oil prices expected to hit the world's fourth-largest crude producer hard.\nThe Bank of Canada lowered its benchmark overnight rate to 1.25% from 1.75% in response to the epidemic, prompting money markets to price in a better-than-even chance of another reduction next month. The last time it cut by 50 basis points was in 2009 during the financial crisis.\nSOUTH KOREA\nThe government announced a stimulus package of 11.7 trillion won ($9.8 billion) to cushion the impact of the largest outbreak of coronavirus outside China.\nFinance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the supplementary budget, subject to parliamentary approval, would channel money to the health system, childcare, and outdoor markets. An additional 10.3 trillion won in treasury bonds will be issued this year to fund the extra budget.\nSeoul has also dramatically tightened rules on short-selling for three months. Starting March 11, stocks with a sudden and abnormal increase in short-selling transactions will be suspended from further short-selling for 10 days.\n",

Mumbai and most parts of Maharashtra also saw thinner crowds in comparison to other years as well.\nWhile many chose to skip the celebrations altogether, some preferred small gatherings of friends and relatives but without colours. Some, however, played Holi only with 'gulal'.\nEvents like rain dances, Holi parties where large number of people gather were much lesser due to the recent coronavirus developments. The situation seems to be getting tense with each passing day as the number of confirmed cases continued to increase in India.\nOn Tuesday, several new positive cases of coronavirus were reported in Kerala, Pune and Bengaluru.\nConfirmed cases rise\nA total of five cases were reported in Pune today, while four were reported in Bengaluru and six in Kerala. Kerala's total number of positive cases has now gone up to 14, according to state health minister K K Shailaja said.\nA total of 15 cases were reported in India on Tuesday, taking the toll of confirmed cases well over 50.\nThe health ministry, however, said the total number of confirmed cases has risen to 50, adding the rest are being retested for confirmation. Once the fresh cases declared by the state governments are taken into account, the figure will go up to 59 or even more.\nThere are chances that more cases will be reported tomorrow due to the Holi celebrations witnessed in parts of the country.\nDespite the rising death toll, there have been no deaths in India and the health ministry again confirmed the same on Tuesday. It is a good sign for India, which has managed to tackle the coronavirus outbreak better than many other countries around the globe.\nUnion Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday that he spoke to a few coronavirus patients admitted at Medanta and Safdarjung hospitals through video calls on Tuesday and said all the people infected by the disease were stable and showing signs of recovery.\nVardhan also called up Health Ministers of Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Telangana, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh as well as Lt Governors of Ladakh, and Jammu & Kashmir to ascertain the status of the COVID-19 affected patients kept in isolation centres in hospitals, the health ministry said.\nWhile monitoring the COVID-19 situation from his office in the Health Ministry, Vardhan spoke to a few patients through video calls to enquire about their health and their satisfaction with the treatment being given at the isolation wards.\n\"While speaking to the patients, he conveyed that though he wanted to visit them personally, he was dissuaded by the hospital authorities from the visit as they felt that such a visit may hinder regular treatment arrangements for the patients,\" the statement said.\nIndia on guard\nAmid the rising cases of coronavirus affliction globally, India on Tuesday barred entry of the nationals of three more countries -- France, Germany and Spain -- suspending the regular as well as e-Visas granted to them till date.\n\"All regular (sticker) Visas/e-Visas granted to nationals of France, Germany and Spain and issued on or before March 11 and who have not yet entered India stand suspended with immediate effect,\" said a Bureau of Immigration notification issued late Tuesday night.\nRegular visas, including e visas, granted to all foreign nationals who have travel history to these countries on or after February 1 and who have not yet entered India also stands suspended, it said.\nThe new notification was issued shortly after Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba on Tuesday held a high-level meeting of secretaries of various ministries and departments, grappling to contain the spread of the deadly Covid-19.\nThe meeting was held to review the status, actions, preparedness and management of COVID-19 cases in the country, an official statement of Union Health Ministry said after the meeting.\nWith more than 100 countries across the world now having reported cases of COVID-19, the Union Health Ministry in its advisory also urged its citizens returning from abroad to self-monitor their health and follow the recommended do's and dont's.\n58 Indians fly home from Iran\nIn the morning, 58 Indians were brought back home from coronavirus-hit Iran in a military transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF).\nIAF spokesperson Group Captain Anupam Banerjee said the C-17 Globemaster aircraft evacuated 25 men, 31 women and two children.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Coronavirus outbreak has been reported from 75 countries after originating in Wuhan in China in mid-December, and first reporting in mid-January. Sitting next to epicentre of coronavirus outbreak, India managed to keep Covid-19 or Coronavirus Disease 2019 largely at bay for more than two months.\nNow, at least 28 people have tested positive for Covid-19, the Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said. First three cases were reported from Kerala in February. There were isolated and discharged after a successful treatment.\nIndia evacuated around 200 people from Wuhan and kept them in quarantine at a camp in the outskirts of Delhi. They too were released after 14 days of quarantine.\nWhen it seemed that India might have pulled out a miracle of sort in insulating itself from an international contagion, two fresh cases over the weekends shook up the nation. Rush to medical stores became frantic in every major city and, hand sanitisers and face masks of all kinds became scarce once again.\nOf the two cases, one was reported from Delhi sending the media in alarm mode with government agencies asking people not to panic and follow advisory, most important of which requires keeping hands clean either with soap or alcohol-based sanitisers, minimise hand-face contact, staying away from infected persons and report to a hospital if there are symptoms such as sore throat, breathlessness combined with other indicators of flu.\nReporting to hospitals in case of symptoms is key to preventing further spread of coronavirus infection. Scientists are yet to conclusively ascertain that how many healthy persons may be infected by one Covid-19 patient. Some Covid-19 patients may infect more persons than other carriers. Quarantine and isolation - depending on when the carrier reports contact with infected person or infection - is a must for such persons.\nCOVID-19 SUPER SPREADER\nDiscovery of one such patient during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS outbreak in 2003 had led to use of the term, \"super spreader\", which is not officially recognised by government agencies or the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn the case of coronavirus outbreak the first super spreader was identified in South Korea. Now, she is known as \"Patient 31\" and is held responsible for spreading corornavirus to \"countless\" people.\nShe is a member of a little known religious sect, Shincheonji Church of Jesus. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has filed a formal complaint against the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, accusing it of murder.\nThe reason is that the Patient 31 continued to attend public gatherings including at restaurants, markets and church apparently ignoring the advice of doctors. The sentiment in South Korea is that she should have taken her case seriously and presented herself to health authorities.\nTHE INDIAN CASE\nIn India, the prompt action in the initial stage by the Kerala health authorities in shifting the first Covid-19 patients to isolation and the Indian government in keeping the Wuhan evacuees in quarantine killed the chances of anyone turning into a super spreader.\nBut with the reporting of fresh cases has revived the fear. The Delhi coronavirus patient, a 45-year-old man, returned from a Europe tour on February 25. He had been to Italy on a road trip.\nItaly is one of the worst-affected countries in the grip of coronavirus outbreak. But his screening could not be done at the airport as the government put Italy on the watch-list only on February 26 when reports of coronavirus infection from the country became too frequent.\nOn his return, he went about his daily routine as usual. He threw birthday party for his son, where students of two prominent schools in Noida were also present. The two schools had now been shut.\nAfter a few days, when the man showed symptoms of Covid-19, he reported to the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. The government authorities are still in the process of contact-tracing all those, this patient came in contact.\nSix of his relatives from Agra in Uttar Pradesh became coronavirus patients after he visited them upon his return from Europe tour.\nIGNORANCE IS LOSS, NOT BLISS\nThe other patient is a software engineer, who works in Bengaluru but belongs to Hyderabad. He had been to Dubai, where his coworkers were from Hong Kong, a country severely affected by coronavirus outbreak.\nHe returned from Dubai on February 19/20 and reported to his office. Few days later, he took a bus to Hyderabad, where he showed symptoms of Covid-19 and approached a private hospital first. He was referred to a government hospital, where his coronavirus infection was confirmed.\nThe government authorities are in the process of contact-tracing of all the people the infected techie might have come in contact with including the passengers of the bus. More than 100 people are being monitored for suspected coronavirus infection.\nCOVID-19 FROM ITALY GUESTS\nThe biggest case of coronavirus infection reported in India is of a group of Italian tourists who arrived in Rajasthan in the last week of February. The group had been travelling till a 69-year-man of the troupe was confirmed as a Covid-19 patient. They went to places including Agra. They were assisted by Indian tour operators and guides.\nNow, 15 of the Italian group have tested positive and shifted to specialised camp in the outskirts of Delhi. The authorities are on contact-tracing hunt to screen all those people who came in contact with this group and advise quarantine measures to all the suspects.\nA driver who was ferried the Italian group has also tested positive for coronavirus.\nHOW NOT TO BE SUPER SPREADER\nIt is important to understand who can be a coronavirus carrier. Practically, anyone who has come in direct or indirect contact with a Covid-19 patient or carrier. Normally, an infected person would show symptoms and once reported, the doctors would keep the patient in isolation.\nBut some other persons, with robust immune system, may be able to suppress the symptoms and yet pass on the virus to people with vulnerable immunity. Since the coronavirus spreader may not show symptoms due to strong immunity, he or she might continue to infect others, and become a super spreader.\nSecondly, not every coronavirus carrier or patient houses same load of virus. Those with greater load are capable of infecting greater number of people.\nEach one of the Covid-19 patients diagnosed in India was a potential super spreader. Italian group remained unscreened and non-quarantined for far too long. The Delhi man reported days after his visit to Italy, and the country having been placed on the watchlist. Reporting of his travel to Italy on February 26 would have containing the spread of coronavirus, and saved even his own relatives.\nBengaluru techie too did not report to health authorities despite having come in contact with professionals from Hong Kong, which was already infested by Covid-19. He was not screened, quarantined or isolated for days after he is suspected to have contracted coronavirus infection.\nReporting his contact with Hong Kong nationals would have saved several people in at least two cities - Bengaluru and Hyderabad - from the scare of possible coronavirus infection.\nAll these Covid-19 patients went ahead with their usual routine not realising that they could be coronavirus carriers, and potential super spreaders. It is time to report. Remember the old saying, prevention is better than cure.\n",

Three of the patients have recovered.\nAs concerns over the spread of the virus mounted after two more persons tested positive on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held an extensive review on the preparedness. He urged the people not to panic and instead take basic protective measures.\nSources said the patient from Mayur Vihar in Delhi, who had travelled to Italy recently and tested positive on Monday, was shifted to a quarantine ward at Safdarjung Hospital on Sunday night.\nSamples from six people from Noida, including three children, have been taken to check if anyone has been infected, Noida's Chief Medical Officer Anurag Bhargava said.\nFumigation was underway in both the schools and a Health Department team led by Noida's chief medical officer visited the site, an official said.\nWhile some family members of the man, an accountant and others who came in contact with him were asked to remain quarantined at their homes in Delhi and Agra, six others from Agra with \"high-viral load\" have been kept in isolation at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi and their samples sent to NIV, Pune, officials said.\nContact tracing of the people who came in contact with the six is simultaneously being done through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) network, the Health Ministry said in a statement.\nIn a statement, the Uttar Pradesh government said that two Agra residents, who had come in contact with the Delhi man, were found to be having symptoms of coronavirus.\n\"As many as 23 contacts were identified, and report of 13 persons were obtained.

        "news_content_translate_en": "According to the report of Deutsche Welle today, the sequela of the new crown: the loss of lung function by 30% leads to testicular infertility? The novel coronavirus pneumonia has spread to over 100 countries worldwide. Besides the epidemic prevention, the sequelae caused by the virus have also attracted much attention.\nNovel coronavirus pneumonia has been recorded in Hongkong since, and about 70 people have recovered from the disease, according to the comprehensive media report of the 130 media. The center for infectious diseases of Margaret Hospital analyzed the data of the first batch of more than 10 discharged patients. Among them, 2-3 convalescents were short of breath when they were walking fast, they could not do exercise as usual, or even could not do the previous work. It is estimated that \"lung function damage is not half, but it is 20-30%.\nZeng Dexian, chairman of the clinical treatment task force of the medical authority and medical director of the infectious diseases center, explained that viral pneumonia can lead to pulmonary fibrosis, which needs to be treated with drugs. After recovery, there may be scars, which will hinder breathing when the scar tissue becomes hard. He said that in 2003, the recovery of SARS patients also had poor pulmonary function. At present, we are still observing the long-term impact of the new coronavirus on the patients. The authorities will take a pulmonary function test and arrange physical treatment for the rehabilitation patients during the follow-up. They also suggest that the patients do more lung expansion exercises such as swimming, running, etc., which is believed to help improve their pulmonary function. As of March 11, the hospital has received 26 patients diagnosed with the new coronavirus, 6 of whom are seriously ill, 5 of whom need to stay in the intensive care department, and 2 have died so far. Of the 26 confirmed patients, 21 received drug treatment, while the other 5 were younger and had no obvious symptoms. They were expected to recover on their own.\nNovel coronavirus, China's Hubei provincial government website, published an article in March 12th, which quoted professor Li Yufeng from Huazhong University of Science and Technology's Tongji Hospital Reproductive Medicine Center as the main cause of the new coronavirus infection, which could damage the function of the testis in theory. Novel coronavirus infection has not been studied to confirm whether the infection of the new coronavirus affects male fertility, but the new crown virus is highly similar to the SARS virus. The infection is the same as the invasion cell receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Although SARS virus has not been detected in testis, \"SARS infection can still cause severe immune damage to testis, orchitis and extensive destruction of reproductive related cells\". Therefore, theoretically, it is speculated that new crown infection can cause testis damage, affect sperm production and androgen synthesis, and seriously cause male infertilit。\nAccording to the research team's recommendations, the age of men who have been infected with the virus need to be admitted to the hospital for semen quality and hormone level tests after recovery in order to deal with the problem as early as possible. After the article was published, it caused hot discussion on the Internet, and the article was removed from the shelves today.\nAccording to the report, \"surging news\" contacted Li Yufeng through Tongji Hospital. In response to the inquiry, he pointed out that the new coronavirus infection may cause testicular damage \"theoretically based\". The main purpose of the article is to remind patients to check after cure, but stressed that relevant research is still in progress. Asked if there is any testicular injury, the head of the hospital responded: \"the clinical time is not enough without such a fast speed.\"\nAccording to a paper published on preprints on February 21 local time, 2019 coronavirus infection may inhibit the reproduction related functions of targeted cells and lead to failure of spermatogenesis, the paper continued. Both authors are from institutes affiliated to the National Institutes of health. Their papers have not been peer reviewed or published in official journals. Qi Lihua, Chi Xiaochun, et al. From Peking University Medical Department, were cited in two papers published in January and February 2007. They pointed out that male patients with orchitis were caused by SARS, and there were many causes, among which the autoimmune damage caused by SARS virus might be one of the main causes.\nAccording to Hong Kong 01, ye Weijin, a urologist in Hong Kong, agreed that \"in theory, the new crown virus can infect testicles\", but since the virus can run in patients' bodies for a period of time, it is recommended to wait six months to one year after recovery before accepting testicular function related tests",

It works like some sort of bar code that's read through the cell phone camera. The purpose of the Beijing Government is to warn citizens at risk of contracting dens-19 which must be isolated, as well as to monitor their entry into public spaces such as metro stations and shopping malls.\nThe code is generated by the Alipay Health Code application, which was developed by the Alipay team, a popular payment application in the country belonging to the same group as the technological giant Alibaba.\n\"The QR codes, produced with the mobile application of Alipay, are based on user movements in the last two weeks and assess whether users have visited areas affected by the virus\", reads in the communication shared on the website of the National Health Commission of China. Zhejiang, Sichuan and Hainan provinces were the first to adopt the use of QR Code which is already used in more than 200 Chinese cities.\nThe information is combined with an enquiry into the state of health of citizens. At the end, a color is attributed to users: green (if there is no reason to isolate), yellow (necessary seven days of isolation), or red (14 days of isolation).\nTo enter many public spaces, citizens must show the QR code of the application to \"green\". According to an article published by the Chinese news agency Xinhua, expressions such as \"Are you green today? \"have become a code to talk about the outbreak of covid-1Yeah.\nThe result is associated with information that citizens use to register in the application such as name, identity number and mobile phone number, but no further details about the future of such data are revealed after the outbreak of covid-19.\nIt is not the only example of mobile application used to stop the spread of the virus.

The financial situation of the group, which was difficult several months ago, was rapidly worsened by the restrictions imposed by the new coronavirus in the last month, in terms of air travel and tourism, on the main business of the Chinese holding company.\nThis Saturday, February 29, it was the company itself that, through its official WeChat social network account, took over the growing risk of liquidity shortages on its own, as Reuters reported.\nHNA is a shareholder in several passenger and cargo air transport companies, including Hainan Airlines and Beijing Capital Airlines, which continues to call, once a week, Lisbon and Beijing.\nReuters argues that the working group now set up is led by Gu Gang, president of Hainan Development Holdings, an investment company owned by the local government of Hainan. The team also includes representatives from the Hainan Economic Development Area, the civil aviation authority from central and southern China and the China Development Bank.

Bloomberg estimates that by mid-2019 the group's debt would already have fallen, but was in 525,6 billion yuan (about 81 billion euro at present).\nWith the advent of the new coronavirus and the restrictions imposed by the Chinese authorities and the World Health Organisation (WHO), Hainan Airlines and other more directly affected companies have attempted to mitigate their losses, for example by placing foreign workers on unpaid leave, Reuters explains.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Within five days, since Saturday, the number of infected with the new coronavirus in Europe has skyrocketed from five dozen to more than 450; the number of deaths from one to 14. And with the arrival of the coronavirus in Brazil, with a confirmation this Wednesday in Sao Paulo, Antarctica becomes the only continent without cases. This has entered a new phase in which Covid-19 is already spreading more rapidly around the world than in China.\nEven if the acceleration of the outbreak is causing concern within the European Union (EU), the situation is not, for the moment, cause for panic: the EU has again ensured on Tuesday that it is working \"on all fronts\" to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in Europe, insisting on the need for coordination of the Member States \"in real time\" to tackle a phenomenon that is \"dynamic\".\nThe European Commission has reinforced that the key is for the EU as a whole to be \"ready\" for a possible increase in the epidemic, both in terms of treatment and in terms of containing the outbreak. One of the most sensitive issues linked to increased cases, particularly the situation in Italy, is border control, which the Commission has emphasised is not within its competence, but that of each Member State. However, such a scenario is not discarded either.\nItaly is the country most concerned by the European health authorities. This is because there has been a sudden increase in positive cases since Friday: only three people infected with the virus were accounted for on that day, but that number has since risen to 400 infected. This Wednesday was also confirmed as the twelfth victim in the country.\nThe Italian authorities are increasingly trying to tighten the siege on Covid-19: the containment measures announced this weekend for ten locations where they live for around fifty thousand people remain in forcYeah. V, Piedmont and Lombardy in northern Italy are the critical regions located in the red zone.\nFor the time being, the death pattern in Italy is similar to that in China. Older people with associated diseases, such a s cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, are being most affected.\nAfter Italy, Germany remains the European country with the most cases, but without new infections. France has already confirmed a total of 17 infected in the country and a second fatality: a 60-year-old French man died at dawn in Paris after being diagnosed. Norway, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, Spain, Northern Macedonia and Greece have also confirmed new cases of infection.\nSo far, the only known case of a Portuguese infected by the new virus is that of Adriano Maranh o, the crewman of a cruise ship who was admitted to a Japanese hospital in Okazaki, about thirty miles from Tokyo. All suspected cases detected in Portugal (until this Wednesday were 18) were negative.\nThe virus that has already made more than 2760 dead (most of them in China) is now spreading at the highest speed around the world and there are already people infected in more than 40 countries. In addition to deaths in mainland China, victims are reported in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, France and Taiwan.\nThis Wednesday, China reported 52 deaths, the smallest daily increase in three weeks, while reporting 406 new cases, most in Hubei province. The number of new patients thus recorded a fall of 20%, compared to Monday, for example. According to the updated data by the Chinese National Health Commission, the country is adding more than 2700 dead and 78 thousand confirmed cases. Among the infected, more than 45 thousand were still active and more than 8500 patients were in serious condition. On the other hand, almost thirty thousand people have already been releaseYeah.\nAlthough Iran is the country with the most deaths from the new coronavirus after China, 139 cases of infection have been reported only last week and 19 people have died, President Hassan Rouhani said his government is not planning to quarantine cities and districts of the country.\nHowever, the authorities have already closed schools and some universities and admit to extending this decision for a few more days. There are also plans to restrict access to Shiite sacred sites this Friday. On the other hand, 11 countries have already \"closed\" their land and air borders with Iran (neighbouring Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Armenia, and other countries in the region such a s Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Georgia).\nAvoiding panic is one of the key messages from the World Health Organisation (WHO): the organisation's public health director, Maria Neira, assured this Wednesday that it is \"irrational and disproportionate\" that masks and disinfectants are exhausted in pharmacies for fear of coronavirus. In statements to the Spanish broadcaster RAC-1, Neira recalled that masks are for the use of health personnel and stressed that the decrease of victims and diseases occurring in China \"may mean that the epidemic has reached the summit and reached the epidemic peak\". On the other hand, Bruce Aylward, the specialist who led the WHO team sent to China, warned that the planet is \"not ready\" to face a pandemic of this new coronavirus.\nAs for the preparation of our country, the Foreign Minister, has assured us that we are prepared for a possible entry of the Covid-19 coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva mentioned this Wednesday that there is a contingency plan ready to be activated in Portugal. However, it stressed that this is a global problem requiring concerted action, mainly at European levelYeah.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs already announced, Portugal is strengthening prevention measures and the network of available laboratories and hospitals to receive suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus. In terms of future measures, the Portuguese Government does not rule out the closure of borders, but has strengthened that it will only do so together with the European Union, in line with the intentions of the European Commission.\nThe pneumologist and coordinator of the crisis office of the Order of Physicians, Filipe Froes, said this Wednesday to Lusa that, compared to the response capacity for influenza A ten years ago, there is now \"less hospital response capacity, less human resources and less differentiation\". \"The challenge will be much greater, but it must also be adjusted to the transmission of the disease, to the number of Portuguese affected and to gravity,\" he said, stressing that \"the challenge at this time is still unknown\"",

Xi Jinping, as a highly centralized State authority source, is constrained to open some windows, leaving to air a system accustomed to secrecy, while tightening control elsewhere.\nIt is with this in mind that the announcement this Sunday of Xi Jinping's speech to the Third of February in which he reports that he gave orders to the 7th of January during a meeting of the Standing Committee on Politburo, the most powerful body in Chinese policy, for the implementation of measures to prevent infections with the new coronavirus. The speech is published in Qiushi magazine, described by the CPC's official journal, as \"a reference publication of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China\"Yeah.\nIn this speech, accompanied by photos of Xi and other leaders in blue paper masks, the Chinese President says he authorized the unprecedented quarantine in Wuhan from 23 January, a city with 11 million people, which is an important knot of rail, river and air transport, with a technological and automotive production centre for international brands, and also in an important area of agricultural production.\nAlthough Xi reported his actions since the beginning of January, only on the 20th day of January Xi spoke publicly of the new disease and the Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of the epidemic in the city of Wuhan, which had then spread to other Chinese cities and other countries. It was on that day that the Beijing authorities confirmed that Covid-19 was passing between humans, when alarm began to take on a new tone.\nXi Jinping's advisors will have thought that the disclosure of this debate will show that the Chinese President has been aware of the crisis from the beginning, and they hope to dispel criticism because he has not publicly appeared to lead the actions against the emergency, which has already killed 1665 in a total of 68.500 infections. \"The general tone of the speech seems defensive\", he told the New York Times Minxin Pei, professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California (USA). \"He wants to change the narrative, which so far has been very unfavorable to Chinese lieutenants.\"\n\"I have followed at all times the spread of the epidemic and the progress in efforts to contain it, constantly issuing orders orally and instructions,\" Xi Jinping said in the speech quoted by the New York Times.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the most profound works of the publiYeah.\nThe Chinese executive now faces several criticisms and public discontent, which became acute earlier this month after the death of Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor, 34-year-old, who issued warnings about the new virus and was arrested for spreading rumours and forced to sign a document unfolding, and who died. after contracting Covid-19.\nA few hours after the announcement of the speech, China announced a drop in the new Covid-19 cases for the third consecutive day. New cases were reported this Sunday 2009 in mainland China, which excludes Macao and Hong Kong, raising the total number to 68.500. The mortality rate remained stable, with 142 new deaths, the National Health Commission informed. The number of deaths in mainland China by the new coronavirus was fixed in the 1665. There is also a dead person registered in the Chinese special administrative region of Hong Kong, one in the Philippines, one in Japan and one in France (recorded this Saturday), raising the total number of deaths worldwide to 1669",

However, since the 30th day in January we have been operating with a picket line of some officials to deal with the most urgent and other cases related to situations in the new coronavirus crisis,\" added.\n\"Applying to the general consulate the guidelines issued by the chief executive to the RAEM civil servants, we will remain closed to the general public and keep the picket service in the consular chancellery,\" said the diplomat.\nThe general consulate of Portugal in Macao and Hong Kong can be reached by phone 00 853 2835 6660, by email [protected email] or via message on the respective page of the social network Facebook.\nAt a press conference earlier this afternoon (local time), the head of the Macao government announced that casinos would be closed for two weeks, as well as the continued suspension of basic public service services.

In at least six of these Taipa island spaces, the scenario was the same: crowded corridors, huge queues to make the payment, with people in masks pushing shopping cars where they were stacked meat packs, canned goods, rice bags and water bottles.\nOn the other hand, it was possible to see queues in the streets to enter spaces that sell frozen foods, which rivaled others that have been maintained for more than a week to purchase rational sales masks in pharmacies.\nThe Macao government has acquired all twenty million masks.

Authorities have reported that more than 2.9 million masks have been sold since the announcement of the first case of infection in Macao two weeks ago.\nAs for disinfectants, also exhausted in Macao, Ho Iat Seng stressed that he will not use the same method of rationing for the population. \"We will not guarantee this type of product\" for the population, he said. \"It is important in hospitals and homes (...), these must be guaranteed,\" he said, adding that four tons of disinfectant products have been acquired. \"The priority is for medical workers (...), we do not want doctors and nurses to be infected,\" he said.\nThe press conference to publicize the exceptional measures took place on the day Macao announced that it had identified the tenth case of infection in the territory and accepted the possibility of a Community outbreak in the light of the scenario of a case of local contamination.\nChina elevated to 426 dead and more than twenty.400 infected the balance of the pneumonia outbreak in the country caused by a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected last December in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province (centre), which has cities under quarantine, affecting about five million people.\nHong Kong announced this morning the first coronavirus-related death.\nThe old British territory suspended sea links with Macao and closed almost all land and sea borders with the continent to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD - India said on Saturday it was planning to turn some railway coaches into isolation wards for patients with coronavirus, as authorities scramble to prepare the country's health infrastructure for an expected surge in cases.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the country's 1.3 billion people this week to stay indoors for three weeks in the world's biggest lockdown, seeking to curb the spread of the illness. India's network of trains, the country's lifeblood, has been idled.  \n One train coach has been turned into a prototype quarantine facility, state-owned Indian Railways said in a statement on Saturday.  \n Once they get clearance, the plan is for each of India's railway zones to convert 10 coaches into such wards every week, the company added. Indian Railways has 16 zones, according to its website.  \n \"Railways will offer clean, sanitised & hygienic surroundings for the patients to comfortably recover,\" tweeted railways minister Piyush Goyal. He did not specify how many people could be cared for in each coach.  \n India has reported 918 confirmed cases, including 19 deaths.  \n The lockdown measures are taking a huge toll on India's poor, including millions of migrant labourers whose jobs in cities have vanished. Many are now walking back to their villages or crowded bus stations in the hopes of finding rare transport, raising fears they will unintentionally spread the virus across India.  \n On Saturday, a migrant worker, who set out from New Delhi on a 270 kilometres (168 miles) walk to his hometown in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, collapsed and died, a police official said.  \n India's home ministry said in a statement on Saturday it was advising states to provide food and shelter to migrants at relief camps alongside highways.  \n  \n PAKISTAN SEEKS ARRESTS  \n Overall, the number of coronavirus cases in South Asia has risen to 2,648, including 39 deaths. Sri Lanka reported its first coronavirus death on Saturday, a 65-year-old diabetic tour guide.  \n While the toll in South Asia remains low overall, there are fears it could swell given the region's poor health services and population density.  \n In Pakistan, police on Saturday arrested 38 prayer leaders and mosque officials for violating a ban on congregational prayers even as cases swelled to over 1,400 in the country.  \n A plane carrying relief assistance and eight doctors from key ally China landed in Islamabad on Saturday, a Pakistani foreign ministry statement said.  \n \"(They will) advise our health care specialists in the light of their experience and success in battling COVID-19 in China,\" the statement read. China has already given Islamabad testing kits, masks, protective gear and other medical equipment.  \n In Nepal, more than 600 European tourists were evacuated on charter flights on Saturday, authorities said, but thousands more are still waiting to be brought home by their countries.  \n \"This will leave between 8,000 and 10,000 tourists still stranded due to lockdown in Nepal,\" said Dhananjay Regmi, the chief of Nepal's tourism board.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Although postgraduate student Kimberley is serving out her 14-day stay-home notice confined in a hotel room and away from her family, her mother has ensured that she will not miss the familiarity of home. \n The 23-year-old, who is doing a master’s degree course on affective disorders at a British university and who wanted to be known only by her first name, said that her mother will try to deliver both lunch and dinner on “most days” to her. She has so far received her favourite bacon bone curry, among others, and even a yoga mat to help her stay active.  \n “She’s honestly the best,” Kimberley said of her mother, who leaves the items by the door of the Fraser Suites service apartment before running away. \n Kimberley said: “She’s very fast. By the time we get to the door, she’s not even on the floor anymore.” \n The postgraduate student returned to Singapore from the United Kingdom with her 24-year-old brother and her 25-year-old boyfriend on Tuesday evening, and they are now staying together in the same service apartment.  \n The trio are just one group of returning students out of many who are making their way back after the Singapore Government asked them to return home on March 17 due to the Covid-19 crisis.  \n CHANGING TRACKS \n The hotel industry here has been in a slump due to the lack of tourists caused by the global crisis. \n On Thursday, a message by President Halimah Yacob was read out in Parliament where she noted that Singapore’s hotel occupancy rate is at just 20 per cent presently. \n Now, hotels are gearing up to change tracks by taking in guests such as Kimberley who must serve their mandatory stay-home notice. \n Those who are served the notice cannot leave their place of stay or residence during the period, which begins from the time they land in Singapore. \n Some hoteliers told TODAY that being able to take in guests serving their stay-home notice has been an unexpected lifeline for them, given the gradual decline in tourist arrivals. \n Mr Adrian Siow is manager for Rest Bugis Hotel and Hotel 1888 Collection in Chinatown. Both properties are offering their rooms at a lower fixed rate for such individuals. \n He noted a “small surge” in demand as well after Malaysia’s lockdown recently, with Malaysian workers needing accommodation after they chose to stay and work here. \n However, Mr Siow said that their stay will not be indefinite and the industry is “struggling right now”. \n Since February, tourists who had visited mainland China have been barred from entering Singapore, in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. This travel ban was extended to all other tourists on March 22. \n MINIMISING RISK BETWEEN TWO GROUPS \n Elsewhere, to boost occupancy rates, some branded hotels have begun offering staycation deals for residents who have had to cancel overseas holiday plans, while at the same time offering their rooms for those serving stay-home notices. \n Several of these properties are on the Singapore Global Network’s list of hotels for people who need to serve out their notice. \n They declined or did not respond to TODAY’s queries about what precautions they were putting in place to keep all guests and staff members safe from the risk of infection. \n However, when this reporter posed as a potential guest at three hotels, they gave assurances that they have a system in place to minimise or even eliminate contact between those serving their stay-home notice and guests just looking for a quick getaway.  \n In all instances, they said that the guests on stay-home notice are not allowed to leave their rooms at all times until the 14-day period is over. \n This applies for Mr Siow’s establishment as well. \n Mr Siow said that regardless of which hotel such guests are staying, housekeeping staff members are not allowed to enter the room during the notice period. A “deep-cleaning” process will be carried out once they leave, he said.  \n  Guests on stay-home notice who have checked into Grand Park Orchard are provided with a greater quantity of toiletries. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n Employees at both JW Marriott Hotel and Grand Hyatt Singapore also said that they have designated certain floors just for individuals on stay-home notice when this reporter asked as a guest.  \n At the Mandarin Orchard hotel, an employee said that it has dedicated one of its two towers just for this purpose. \n When asked what the chances were of a guest on stay-home notice checking in at the same time as a regular guest, the employee said that the chances are low because there are separate check-in counters for both categories of guests. \n All three hotels also said that they have stepped up cleaning frequency within their premises. \n Grand Hyatt, which was the among the first hotels here to receive the SG Clean certification, “frequently cleans up and wipes down high touch points” as well, its employee stressed.  \n To obtain the certification by the National Environment Agency, firms must meet a checklist of seven requirements. This includes the appointment of an SG Clean manager to oversee the hotel’s practices, putting in place processes to monitor the health of employees, and ensuring frequent disinfection of common facilities. \n DEDICATED HOTELS FOR RETURNING STUDENTS \n Aside from Grand Hyatt, Village Hotel Sentosa and Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa have also obtained this certification. These three hotels have all been linked to Covid-19 cases before. \n Village Hotel Sentosa and Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa will join a list of government-designated hotels for returning students from the United States and the UK.  \n The Ministry of Health said that from March 26, Singapore students returning from the US and UK have to serve their stay-home notice at facilities such as the hotels on the list that have agreed to dedicate their entire premises just for this purpose. \n The ministry said that it will arrange for the students to be taken directly from the airport to the hotels and the returnees will have their own room and toilet, and have all their meals provided. \n All these arrangements will be provided for free. \n  Guests serving their stay-home notice at Grand Park Orchard receive meals prepared by the hotel. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n The full list of government-designated hotels has not been made public, but TODAY understands that it also includes Village Hotel Albert Court, The Elizabeth Hotel and Grand Park Orchard. \n Mr Arthur Kiong, chief executive officer of Far East Hospitality — which manages the Village Hotel chains and The Elizabeth Hotel — said that as a homegrown company, he felt that it was a “national duty” to support government initiatives and help Singaporeans and residents get through this Covid-19 storm. \n This was a sentiment shared by Ms Tan Shin Hui, executive director of Park Hotel Group, which manages Grand Park Orchard, located opposite Paragon mall.  \n Both Mr Kiong and Ms Tan said that their designated hotels have several precautions in place to prepare for the arrival of these returning students.  \n For instance, from now till May 31, only guests serving their stay-home notice can access the designated hotels under Far East Hospitality. No other guests will be accepted.  \n Over at Grand Park Orchard, Ms Tan said that it has “taken extra precautionary measures” such as providing clear segregation of entry for individuals serving the notice and for employees or the public.  \n  An alternative entrance for guests who are serving their stay-home notice at Grand Park Orchard.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON — The United States now has more Covid-19 infections than any other country, and a record number of newly unemployed people, as the coronavirus crisis deepens around the world. \n Hours after his nation reached the grim milestone, US President Donald Trump spoke by phone to China's Xi Jinping, after weeks of bickering and finger pointing over a disease researchers say could kill at least 1.8 million people by the end of the year. \n \"Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China,\" Mr Trump tweeted. \n \"China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!\" \n The warm words — which were not quite echoed in the Chinese state media readout of the call — came after a few weeks in which the White House had repeatedly referred to \"the Chinese coronavirus\", angering Beijing. \n China, which appears to have got on top of its own outbreak, readied to bar entry to foreigners as it frets over a surge in imported cases, illustrating the difficulty of containing a virus in an interconnected world. \n Wuhan, the city where the illness first emerged late last year, was — from midnight — to ease severe movement restrictions in place for two months. \n That initial lockdown has now been aped around the world, with three billion people told to stay indoors. \n Healthcare systems in even the most developed nations are being stretched to breaking point with dire warnings they could soon be overwhelmed. \n More than 530,000 people globally have been sickened by the disease. \n A tally by Johns Hopkins University showed that by around 5pm SGT Friday (March 27), there were almost 86,000 known infections in the US. That figure is higher than both China and hard-hit Italy, which accounts for a third of the 24,000 deaths worldwide. \n GRIM PREDICTIONS \n Even with lockdowns implemented around the world, researchers at Imperial College London said Thursday the global death toll could be staggering. \n Their model shows 1.86 million people could die, with nearly 470 million infected this year.  \n Failure to act swiftly in imposing lockdowns and strict social distancing could make those numbers far higher, they warned. \n \"Our analysis highlights the challenging decisions faced by all governments in the coming weeks and months, but demonstrates the extent to which rapid, decisive and collective action now could save millions of lives,\" the researchers said. \n As fears mount over a global recession that could even dwarf the Great Depression of the 1930s, leaders from the Group of 20 major economies held crisis talks by video link on Thursday. \n They pledged a \"united front\" to fight the outbreak — along with an enormous financial rescue package. \n \"The virus respects no borders,\" the leaders said in a statement. \n \"We are injecting over US$5 trillion (S$7.17 trillion) into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic.\" \n They also pledged \"robust\" support for developing nations, where experts fear the coronavirus could wreak havoc. \n PAINFUL CHOICES \n Medical systems in even the most developed nations are straining under the weight of new patients. \n In New York, where tens of thousands are ill, Governor Andrew Cuomo warned there were simply not enough hospital beds. \n \"Almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current healthcare system,\" he said. \n For those fighting on the frontlines, the pressure was showing. \n \"To watch somebody in their thirties die, it's hard,\" said one respiratory therapist in the city who requested anonymity. \"You can't have visitors. They're in the room by themselves on a ventilator. It's very depressing.\" \n In Europe, medics were already having to make choices. \n \"If I've got five patients and only one bed, I have to choose who gets it,\" Dr Sara Chinchilla, a pediatrician at a hospital near Madrid, told AFP. \n \"People are dying who could be saved but there's no space in intensive care.\" \n ECONOMIC DEVASTATION \n The pandemic has already become catastrophic for the global economy. \n In the United States, the world's largest economy, the Labor Department reported that 3.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week — by far the highest number ever recorded. \n Job losses have swept across sectors from food services to retail to transportation, as nearly half of the country has closed non-essential businesses. \n \"It is staggering. We are only seeing the initial numbers; they will get worse, unfortunately,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work. \n Stock markets remained volatile, with Asian bourses in the green Friday after a third straight day of rises on Wall Street, while Europe started the day down. \n Traders have taken heart from the passage through the Senate of a $2 trillion stimulus bill — the largest in US history, which will support American businesses and provide cash payouts averaging US$3,400 for a family of four. \n The bill goes before the House of Representatives on Friday.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading COVID-19 without knowing they are sick.  \n As the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. The border of Hubei province, epicentre of the virus, opened on Wednesday after a two-month shutdown.  \n But there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation.  \n Asymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious disease, making it harder to detect and stop transmission.  \n In China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000.  \n China had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday.  \n Asymptomatic cases are currently found through \"contact tracing\". China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms.  \n \"Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,\" said Wu Zunyou of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. \"So will they be able to create transmission? They won't.\"  \n Still, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing's commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control.  \n Despite recording zero new infections from March 18 to March 22, the COVID-19 hotspot city of Wuhan disclosed on March 20 that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year old man surnamed Zhang had shown no symptoms.  \n Citing hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient.  \n China says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage. But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined.  \n Some experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased.  \n \"It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\" said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney.  \n It is also unclear how much they might infect others.  \n \"We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that’s a major driver of transmission,\" said Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organization at a briefing early in March.  \n New studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Japan.  \n While many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill.  \n Another study published on March 23, looking at cases in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18% of patients were asymptomatic. Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest.  \n The Yale School of Public Health said the existence of presymptomatic (asymptomatic) patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries.  \n \"The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\" said Ian Henderson, Director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University.

        "news_content_translate_en": "PARIS/WASHINGTON - Business activity collapsed from Australia, Japan and Western Europe to the United States at a record pace in March as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic hammer the world economy, cementing economists' views of a deep global recession.  \n The highly contagious coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown and in some places soldiers are patrolling the streets to keep consumers and workers indoors, halting services and production and breaking supply chains.  \n \"The global health crisis is rapidly morphing into a global recession, as there is a clear tension between preventing infections and ruining the economy,\" said Edoardo Campanella, an economist at UniCredit Bank in Milan. \"However, a wise policy coordination between health and fiscal authorities should allow a V-shaped recovery once containment measures are relaxed.\"  \n Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to a reading of 40.5 this month. That was an all-time low and followed a reading of 49.6 in February.  \n Last month's decline in the index, which is seen as a good measure of economic health, was the largest in the series' history. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in business activity. The survey underscored the rapidly deteriorating economy, highlighted last week by a government report showing the biggest rise since 2012 in the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits during the week ended March 14.  \n Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when data for last week is published on Thursday.  \n The message was equally grim from the 19 countries that use the euro. IHS Markit's flash composite PMI for the euro zone plummeted to a record low of 31.4 in March.  \n That was by far the biggest one-month fall since the survey began in mid-1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll which gave a median prediction of 38.8.  \n In France, services activity fell to a record low and manufacturing saw its steepest drop since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.  \n A PMI for the services sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed a record contraction in activity, while sister surveys showed Britain's economy shrinking at a record pace.  \n IHS Markit said the March figures suggested the euro zone economy was shrinking at a quarterly rate of around 2%, and the escalation of measures to contain the virus could steepen the downturn.  \n With most asset markets tanking, global central banks have been rolling out extraordinary measures on an almost daily basis to stop the rot. But some analysts say infinite monetary policy easing may not be enough and fiscal steps are crucial.  \n There was some optimism on that front, with senior Democrats and Republicans saying on Tuesday they were close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package to aid the U.S. economy.  \n Hopes for a large fiscal stimulus sparked a sharp rebound in global stock markets, with the Dow Jones <.DJI> raking up its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933. (Graphic: Coronavirus pandemic hits global business - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3868/3829/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES  \n After an initial outbreak in China brought the world's second-largest economy to a virtual halt last month, an ever-growing number of countries and territories have reported a spike in infections and deaths, leading to \"social distancing\" policies aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19.  \n Goldman Sachs is predicting that the global economy will shrink 1.0% this year, with gross domestic product in China estimated to contract at a 42% annualised rate in the first quarter and GDP in the United States dropping at a record 24% rate in the April-June period.  \n \"The coronacrisis has pushed the world economy into a deep recession,\" said Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius. \"The response to that crisis represents a physical constraint on economic activity that is unprecedented in postwar history.\"  \n The bleak U.S. economic picture ahead of the November presidential election has prompted President Donald Trump to push for businesses to reopen by Easter. Given rising infections and death toll, health experts, economists and politicians have cautioned against such a move, which they say could backfire, with Americans remaining fearful of going out.  \n Trump and Vice President Mike Pence held a conference call with major Wall Street investors on Tuesday.  \n \"Sending the public back to work at this time would be premature,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York. \"The U.S. is better off taking a one-time hit to economic growth, as efforts to terminate the virus continue, rather than run the risk of multiple economic shutdowns.\" (Graphic: U.S. stocks have fallen hard - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3867/3828/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n Mirroring the emptying of supermarket shelves around the world, indebted corporates have rushed into money markets to hoard dollars, with a global shortage of dollar funding threatening to cripple firms from airlines to retailers.  \n PMI surveys from Japan showed the services sector shrinking at its fastest pace on record this month and factory activity contracting at its quickest in a decade.  \n This was consistent with a 4% contraction in 2020, Capital Economics senior economist Marcel Theliant said. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics is expected to deal a heavy blow to the world's third-largest economy.  \n The U.S. Federal Reserve on Monday promised bottomless dollar funding and an array of programs to help keep companies afloat. For the first time, the Fed will back purchases of corporate bonds, backstop direct loans to companies and \"soon\" will roll out a programme to get credit to small and medium-sized businesses. It will also expand its asset purchases by \"as much as needed.\"  \n The Fed last week slashed borrowing costs to zero and took other emergency steps to keep the commercial paper, U.S. Treasury debt and foreign dollar funding markets functional.  \n G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on Tuesday pledged to expand fiscal and monetary actions for as long as necessary to restore growth and confidence.  \n With the International Monetary Fund predicting a global recession, the world's 20 largest economies agreed on Monday to develop an \"action plan,\" but without specifics.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK — A mother who was infected with the coronavirus couldn’t smell her baby’s full diaper. Cooks who can usually name every spice in a restaurant dish can’t smell curry or garlic, and food tastes bland. Others say they can’t pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the foul odour of kitty litter. \n Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of infection. \n On Friday (March 20), British ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease’s spread. The published data is limited, but doctors are concerned enough to raise warnings. \n “We really want to raise awareness that this is a sign of infection and that anyone who develops loss of sense of smell should self-isolate,” Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, wrote in an email. “It could contribute to slowing transmission and save lives.” \n She and Professor Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK, a group representing ear, nose and throat doctors in Britain, issued a joint statement urging health care workers to use personal protective equipment when treating any patients who have lost their senses of smell, and advised against performing nonessential sinus endoscopy procedures on anyone, because the virus replicates in the nose and the throat and an exam can prompt coughs or sneezes that expose the doctor to a high level of virus. \n Two ear, nose and throat specialists in Britain who have been infected with the coronavirus are in critical condition, Dr Hopkins said. Earlier reports from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus first emerged, had warned that ear, nose and throat specialists as well as eye doctors were infected and dying in large numbers, Hopkins said. \n The British physicians cited reports from other countries indicating that significant numbers of coronavirus patients experienced anosmia, saying that in South Korea, where testing has been widespread, 30 per cent of 2,000 patients who tested positive experienced anosmia as their major presenting symptom (these were mild cases). \n The American Academy of Otolaryngology on Sunday posted information on its website saying that mounting anecdotal evidence indicates that lost or reduced sense of smell and loss of taste are significant symptoms associated with Covid-19, and that they have been seen in patients who ultimately tested positive with no other symptoms. \n Dr Rachel Kaye, an assistant professor of otolaryngology at Rutgers, said colleagues in New Rochelle, New York, which has been the center of an outbreak, first alerted her to the smell loss associated with the coronavirus, sharing that patients who had first complained of anosmia later tested positive for the coronavirus. “This raised a lot of alarms for me personally,” Dr Kaye said, because those patients “won’t know to self quarantine.” \n “Most ENTs have on their own accord tried to scale down,” she said, adding that her department at Rutgers had already started using personal protective equipment and stopped performing nonessential exams. \n In the areas of Italy most heavily affected by the virus, doctors say they have concluded that loss of taste and smell is an indication that a person who otherwise seems healthy is in fact carrying the virus and may be spreading it to others. \n “Almost everybody who is hospitalised has this same story,” said Dr Marco Metra, chief of the cardiology department at the main hospital in Brescia, where 700 of 1,200 inpatients have the coronavirus. “You ask about the patient’s wife or husband. And the patient says, ‘My wife has just lost her smell and taste but otherwise she is well.’ So she is likely infected, and she is spreading it with a very mild form.” \n A study from South Korea, where widespread testing has been done, found that 30 per cent of some 2,000 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus reported experiencing anosmia. \n Dr Hendrik Streeck, a German virologist from the University of Bonn who went from house to house in the country’s Heinsberg district to interview coronavirus patients, has said in interviews that at least two-thirds of the more than 100 he talked to with mild disease reported experiencing loss of smell and taste lasting several days. \n Another physician who studied a cluster of coronavirus patients in Germany said in an email that roughly half of the patients had experienced a smell or taste disorder, and that the sensory loss usually presented after the first symptoms of respiratory illness, but could be used to distinguish people who should be tested. \n Dr Clemens Wendtner, a professor of medicine at the Academic Teaching Hospital of Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich, said that the patients regained their ability to smell after a few days or weeks, and that the loss occurred regardless of how sick they got or whether they were congested. Using nasal drops or sprays did not help, Wendtner said. \n Several American patients who have had symptoms consistent with the coronavirus, but who have not been tested or are still awaiting test results, described losing their senses of smell and taste, even though their noses were clear and they were not congested. \n Mr Andrew Berry, 30, developed a fever and body aches about 10 days ago, and then a sore throat and debilitating headaches. He tested negative for influenza and has not gotten the result of a coronavirus test taken four days ago, but his physician was convinced that he had the virus, he said. \n Now, Mr Berry said, he literally cannot smell the coffee. \n “Even with a clear nose, I just realised I couldn’t smell the food that I was cooking, and I couldn’t taste the food that I was making,” said Mr Berry, a tattoo artist based in Orlando, Florida. He was cooking a plantain dish with onions and vinegar, yet he could not smell it. \n Ms Amy Plattmier, a woman from Brooklyn, was not tested for the coronavirus during a recent illness, but her husband then became sick and had a positive test. Ms Plattmier said she usually had a very sensitive nose, but now could barely smell anything — not the bleach she was using to clean the counters, which usually makes her feel nauseated, or the dog’s accident in the bathroom, which she cleaned up. \n Mr Berry has also lost some weight, because he has not had much of an appetite. “Hopefully it’s not a prolonged effect,” he said. “I can imagine it changes the quality of life.” THE NEW YORK TIMES \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BANGKOK — The coronavirus pandemic sweeping across the planet will force city authorities and planners to more seriously consider factors such as population density, technology, food security and inadequate housing, urban experts said. \n In response to the rising number of infections, countries have tightened border controls, imposed travel bans, locked down cities and stepped up surveillance using technology powered by artificial intelligence (AI). \n \"It is likely that Covid-19 will prompt a rethink of urban design and planning in the Asia-Pacific region,\" said Dr Tony Matthews, a senior lecturer in urban and environmental planning at Australia's Griffith University. \n \"There will probably be consideration of desirable population density levels, a greater utilisation of apps and smart data to track health trends, and many cities will probably start to think about their food security more closely,\" he said. \n Countries including China, South Korea and Singapore are using robots, drones and big data to track the outbreak, disinfect hospitals and deliver supplies. \n Such technologies may become a fixture in cities to flag potential problems for quicker response, said Dr Matthews. \n Authorities are also likely to more closely monitor vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever that are shifting due to climate change, and impose limits on the types and numbers of live animals in traditional markets, he said. \n Coronaviruses are zoonotic diseases — meaning they are passed from animals to humans — and the rapid pace of deforestation and urbanisation are major factors in the spread of these diseases in Asia, health experts say. \n Authorities in China said they would tighten supervision of traditional markets in the cities. \n CATALYSTS \n This would not be the first time that an epidemic has led to changes in city planning, research shows. \n The cholera outbreaks of the 1830s led to better sanitation in London and elsewhere, while the tuberculosis epidemic in New York in the early 20th century paved the way for improved public transit systems and housing regulations. \n The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003, which hit cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore, led Singapore to upgrade its medical infrastructure and create systems to map the disease. \n \"Historically, epidemics have acted as catalysts in transforming how diseases are handled, especially in urban areas,\" said Dr Annie Wilkinson, a research fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, a UK-based think tank. \n \"Community engagement is key to effective epidemic control, be it delivering trusted messages, carrying out surveillance, or limiting movement,\" she said. \n In Singapore, which has among the fastest ageing populations in the world, engaging with older people was key as the coronavirus has a higher mortality rate among seniors. \n Singapore's Ministry of Health worked with community partners to ensure that essential services such as home-based care and transportation continued to reach seniors, a spokeswoman for the ministry said. \n More than 500 volunteers aim to visit about 27,000 seniors to keep them updated on the outbreak and address concerns, she said. Other service providers delivered meals and offered counselling. \n Such decentralisation of services may become more common in cities, said Dr Creighton Connolly, a senior lecturer at the University of Lincoln in England. \n \"Decentralisation of services and reducing density are ways to combat disease spread, though this is contrary to sustainable transport and climate-change related goals,\" he said. \n \"Also, very dense cities like Hong Kong and Singapore have contained the virus better than largely rural areas like Lombardy and Veneto in Italy. Ultimately, governance dimensions are more important than planning or design approaches,\" he said. \n FOOD SECURITY \n More than two-thirds of the global population is forecast to live in urban areas by 2050 — up from 56 per cent today, according to the United Nations. \n With cities battling worsening climate-change effects, planners also have to balance competing demands for land. \n China hurriedly built 16 makeshift hospitals in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, to handle the load. \n In Hong Kong, some public housing blocks were requisitioned for quarantine facilities, while in Italy authorities in Genoa are converting a ferry to a hospital boat. \n \"Planners may consider leaving small parcels of strategic urban land available, in case temporary medical facilities or housing need to be set up,\" said Dr Matthews. \n Alongside, authorities will also need to consider the issue of food security amidst lockdowns and closed borders, he said. \n \"Food security is a huge issue because cities don't tend to produce their food,\" he said. \n Singapore, which imports more than 90 per cent of its food, is encouraging more local production, for example. \n Some cities may create stockpiles, while others may try to produce more food locally through urban farming or through intensive growing facilities using hydroponics, Dr Matthews said. \n \"But the bottom line is most cities rely on global supply lines for food and are therefore vulnerable to disruptions.\" \n Perhaps more importantly, planners will have to consider the impact of widening wealth inequality, with millions of homeless people and those living in slums at greater risk of contracting disease, said Dr Wilkinson. \n \"Achieving longer-term changes in urban planning will depend on improving the way we see, understand and address health and living conditions in informal settlements,\" she said. \n \"For many people living on the margins, crisis is already the norm and change is overdue.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "曼谷-城市专家说，全球范围内的冠状病毒大流行将迫使城市当局和规划者更加认真地考虑人口密度、技术、粮食安全和住房不足等因素。\n为了应对日益增多的感染，各国加强了边境管制，实施了旅行禁令，封锁了城市，并加强了使用人工智能技术的监控。\n澳大利亚格里菲斯大学城市与环境规划高级讲师托尼·马修斯博士说：“Covid-19可能会促使人们重新思考亚太地区的城市设计和规划。”。\n他说：“人们可能会考虑理想的人口密度水平，更多地利用应用程序和智能数据来跟踪健康趋势，许多城市可能会开始更密切地考虑他们的粮食安全。”。\n包括中国、韩国和新加坡在内的国家正在使用机器人、无人机和大数据来追踪疫情、为医院消毒和运送物资。\n马修斯博士说，这些技术可能会成为城市里的固定装置，用来标记潜在的问题，以便更快地做出反应。\n他说，当局还可能更密切地监测因气候变化而转移的登革热等媒介传播疾病，并对传统市场上活动物的种类和数量加以限制。\n健康专家说，冠状病毒是人畜共患疾病，也就是说，冠状病毒是从动物传染给人类的，而森林砍伐和城市化的快速发展是这些疾病在亚洲传播的主要因素。\n中国当局表示，将加强对这些城市传统市场的监管。\n催化剂\n研究显示，这将不是第一次流行病导致城市规划的改.\n19世纪30年代爆发的霍乱使伦敦和其他地方的卫生条件得到改善，而20世纪初纽约的肺结核疫情为改善公共交通系统和住房管理铺平了道路。\n2003的严重急性呼吸综合征（SARS）暴发袭击了香港和新加坡等城市，导致新加坡升级其医疗基础设施，并建立系统来映射疾病。\n英国智库发展研究所（Institute of Development Studies）研究员安妮·威尔金森（Annie Wilkinson）博士说：“从历史上看，流行病在改变疾病处理方式方面起到了催化剂的作用，特别是在城市地区。”。\n她说：“社区参与是有效控制流行病的关键，无论是传递可信的信息、进行监测还是限制行动。”。\n新加坡是世界上老龄化最快的国家之一，与老年人接触是关键，因为冠状病毒在老年人中的死亡率较高。\n新加坡卫生部的一位发言人说，卫生部与社区合作伙伴合作，确保家庭护理和交通等基本服务继续惠及老年人。\n她说，500多名志愿者的目标是探访约27000名老年人，让他们了解疫情的最新情况，解决人们的担忧。其他服务提供者提供膳食和咨询服务。\n英国林肯大学（University of Lincoln）高级讲师克雷顿•康诺利（Creighton Connolly）博士表示，这种服务分散可能在城市中变得更加普遍。\n他说：“分散服务和降低密度是对抗疾病传播的方法，尽管这与可持续交通和气候变化相关的目标背道而驰。”。\n“而且，像香港和新加坡这样的非常密集的城市比伦巴第和威内托大区的意大利这样的农村地区更好地控制了病毒。最终，治理层面比规划或设计方法更重要。.\n粮食安全\n据联合国预测，到2050年，全球三分之二以上的人口将生活在城市地区，高于目前的56%。\n随着城市与日益恶化的气候变化影响作斗争，规划者也必须平衡对土地的竞争需求。\n中国仓促在冠状病毒疫情中心城市武汉建设了16家临时医院，以应对疫情。\n在香港，一些公共住房被用于检疫设施，而在意大利，热那亚当局正在将渡船改装为医院船。\n马修斯博士说：“如果需要建立临时医疗设施或住房，规划者可能会考虑留下小块战略城市用地。”。\n他说，除此之外，当局还需要在封锁和关闭边境的情况下考虑粮食安全问题。\n他说：“粮食安全是一个巨大的问题，因为城市往往不生产粮食。\n例如，新加坡90%以上的食品都是进口的，它正在鼓励更多的本地生产。\n马修斯博士说，一些城市可能会建立粮食储备，而另一些城市则可能试图通过城市农业或使用水耕的集约化种植设施在当地生产更多的粮食。\n“但归根结底，大多数城市依赖全球粮食供应线，因此容易受到干扰。”\n威尔金森博士说，也许更重要的是，规划者将不得不考虑日益扩大的财富不平等的影响，数百万无家可归者和那些生活在贫民窟的人更容易感染疾病。\n她说：“要实现城市规划的长期变革，将取决于我们如何看待、了解和处理非正规住区的健康和生活条件。”。\n“对于许多生活在边缘的人来说，危机已经成为常态，变革已经姗姗来迟。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Struck down by coronavirus at the age of 83, the long life of Alfredo Visioli ended with a short ceremony at a graveyard near Cremona, his hometown in northern Italy.  \n \"They buried him like that, without a funeral, without his loved ones, with just a blessing from the priest,\" said his granddaughter Marta Manfredi who couldn't attend. Like most of the old man's family - like most of Italy - she was confined to her home.  \n \"When all this is over,\" she vows, \"we will give him a real funeral.\"  \n Everywhere the coronavirus has struck, regardless of culture or religion, ancient rituals to honour the dead and comfort the bereaved have been cut short or abandoned for fear of spreading it further.  \n The virus, which has killed nearly 9,000 people worldwide, is reshaping many aspects of death, from the practicalities of handling infected bodies to meeting the spiritual and emotional needs of those left behind.  \n In Ireland, the health authority is advising mortuary workers to put face masks on dead bodies to reduce even the minor risk of infection. In Italy, a funeral company is using video links to allow quarantined families to watch a priest bless the deceased. And in South Korea, fear of the virus has caused such a drop in the number of mourners that funeral caterers are struggling for business.  \n There is little time for ceremony in hard-hit cities such as Bergamo, northeast of Milan, where the mortuaries are full and the crematorium is working around the clock, said Giacomo Angeloni, a local official in charge of cemeteries.  \n Bergamo, home to about 120,000 people, has been dealing with 5-6 times the number of dead it would in normal times, he said.  \n Italy has now reported nearly 3,000 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus - the highest outside China where the virus first emerged. The Italian army sent 50 troops and 15 trucks to Bergamo on Wednesday to take bodies to less overwhelmed provinces.  \n A ban on gatherings has shattered the vital rituals that help us grieve, said Andy Langford, the chief operating officer of Cruse Bereavement Care, a British charity providing free care and counselling to those in grief.  \n \"Funerals allow a community to come together, express emotion, talk about that person and formally say goodbye,\" he said.  \n \"When you feel you have no control over how you can grieve, and over how you can experience those last moments with someone, that can complicate how you grieve and make you feel worse,\" he said.  \n  \n EXTRA STAFF  \n In Iran as in northern Italy, hospital and funeral workers are overwhelmed with bodies, as the virus has torn across the country, killing 1,284 people and infecting thousands, according to state TV.  \n The authorities have hired new people to dig graves, said a manager at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. \"We work day and night,\" he said. \"I have never seen such a sad situation. There are no funerals.\"  \n Most corpses arrive by truck and are buried without the ritual washing that Islam dictates, he said.  \n Some Iranians suspect that the official haste to bury them has more to do with obscuring the spiralling death toll than halting the spread of the virus.  \n Deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded as heart attacks or lung infections, a hospital worker in Kashan, a city about a three-hour drive from Tehran, told Reuters.  \n \"The officials are lying about the death toll,\" the worker said. \"I have seen dozens of corpses in the past few days, but they have told us not to talk about it.\" Two nurses at Iranian hospitals also told Reuters they thought the death toll was higher than the official tally.  \n Iranian authorities have rejected allegations of a cover-up, and President Hassan Rouhani, in a televised speech on Mar. 18, said his government had been \"honest and straightforward with the nation.\"  \n  \n INFECTION RISK  \n In several countries, clusters of infection have followed funerals. In South Korea, where more than 90 people have died, the government has urged the families of COVID-19 victims to cremate their loved ones first, and hold the funeral later.  \n Korean funerals usually take place in hospitals, and involve three days of prayers and feasting. Most of the country's early cases were linked to a church in Daegu city and a hospital in a nearby county. In February, several members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus attended a funeral at the hospital for the brother of the church's founder.  \n Since the outbreak, the number of mourners at funerals has plunged by 90%, regardless of whether the deceased had the virus, said Choi Min-ho, secretary general of the Korea Funeral Association.  \n \"The culture of funerals has changed significantly,\" he said. \"A handful of mourners quickly offer condolences and leave the place without dining together out of infection worries.\"  \n Condolence money, traditionally handed over in cash, is now sent via bank transfer, he added.  \n Authorities in Wuhan, the epicentre of China's outbreak and location of the majority of its deaths, quickly identified the funeral business as a potential source of transmission.  \n The local civil affairs bureau in late January ordered all funerals for confirmed COVID-19 victims to be handled at a single funeral home in the city's Hankou district. Mourning ceremonies, usually boisterous social events in China, were curtailed along with all other public gatherings.  \n Those restrictions are still in place, even though the number of new cases has dwindled in recent weeks. Bereaved families are not even allowed to see the bodies of their loved ones, a worker at the funeral home told Reuters.  \n In China, the ashes of the deceased tend to be kept in funeral homes until they are taken to a family plot on public holidays such as the Tomb Sweeping Festival in April. That's also cancelled this year.  \n  \n \"DEATH MANAGEMENT\"  \n In Spain, too, a large cluster of cases has been traced to a funeral in the northern town of Vitoria in late February. At least 60 people who attended tested positive after the event, said local media reports.  \n With over 600 deaths, Spain is the second-worst hit country in Europe after Italy, and most people are now confined to their homes. Referring to these restrictions, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called coronavirus a \"cruel\" disease that paralyses the human need to socialize.  \n In Ireland, up to 100 guests are still allowed at all funerals - for now. But most families are opting for small private ceremonies and encouraging others to express their condolences online through websites such as RIP.ie, where death notices and funeral invitations are usually posted.  \n Open casket funerals are out for any victim of coronavirus, and \"the family should be advised not to kiss the deceased,\" according to new guidelines from Ireland's Health and Safety Executive to its funeral directors.  \n The risk of catching coronavirus from a dead body is slim, public health officials say, but some countries are recommending extra measures.  \n Israel has reported no coronavirus deaths, but its health ministry says the deceased should be double-wrapped in impermeable plastic. Ritual washing and rites will be performed in full protective gear and the corpse re-wrapped in plastic for burial. Normally Israel's Jewish dead are laid to rest in a cloth smock and shroud.  \n Ireland's guidelines advise workers in funeral parlours to put face masks on dead bodies before moving them, in case they \"expel a very small amount of air and viral droplets from the lungs\" and infect the living.  \n In Britain, where the pandemic is still gathering pace, there is widespread anxiety about the likely death toll.  \n Britain has been slower in implementing the strict measures seen elsewhere in Europe, and expert estimates of how many will die from COVID-19 have ranged wildly from the tens to the hundreds of thousands.  \n An emergency bill to tackle the virus, which has killed 104 people in Britain, includes a number of measures the government says will \"streamline the death management process.\" The measures include allowing funeral directors to register a death on behalf of a self-isolating family.  \n Deborah Smith, a spokesperson for the National Association of Funeral Directors, said the bill will help the profession \"preserve the dignity of those who die and care for their bereaved families with compassion - even if they are not able to have the kind of funeral they would have wanted.\"  \n Smith would not be drawn on the expected numbers, but said \"funeral directors are preparing for a variety of scenarios.\"  \n  \n \"NOT ALONE\"  \n One scenario is already playing out in Wuhan.  \n Last month, a worker at the funeral home in Hankou district, identifying himself only as Huang, wrote an essay that was circulated on social media. He said funeral workers were as overwhelmed as the city's medics but had received less recognition.  \n He said staff had worked without a break since the start of the epidemic. \"Some of our employees don't even drink water because they need to go to the toilet and it's difficult to take off the protective clothing,\" he wrote.  \n Half a world away, in the virus-stricken Italian town of Bergamo, funeral workers wage a near-identical struggle.  \n \"It's like being in a war with an invisible enemy,\" said Roberta Caprini, a partner in Centro Funerario Bergamasco, a funeral service in Bergamo. \"We've been working without interruption for two weeks and sleeping 3-4 hours a night when we manage it. Everyone in our area, us included, has lost someone or have someone sick in their home.\"  \n Bergamo's Church of All Saints has become a makeshift mortuary, its pews pushed aside to accommodate the dead. Caprini said she had counted at least 60 coffins when she visited on Tuesday.  \n She spoke of the \"real torture\" felt by families who watched sick relatives taken away to hospital and never saw them again. Her company has arranged video links to burials, to allow families to watch the priest bless the deceased.  \n Sometimes, she said, they drive the hearses past the bereaved family's home, so mourners \"can at least come down at the moment and offer a quick prayer.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "阿尔弗雷多·维奥利83岁时被冠状病毒击倒，在意大利北部家乡克雷莫纳附近的一个墓地举行了简短的仪式，结束了他漫长的生命。\n他无法出席的孙女玛尔塔·曼弗雷迪说：“他们就这样埋葬了他，没有葬礼，没有亲人，只有牧师的祝福。”。像老人家的大多数人一样，像意大利的大多数人一样，她被关在家里。\n“等这一切结束，”她发誓，“我们会给他一个真正的葬礼。”\n在冠状病毒肆虐的每一个地方，无论文化或宗教，为纪念死者和安慰死者家属而举行的古老仪式都被缩短或放弃，以免进一步传播。\n该病毒已经在全球范围内造成近9000人死亡，它正在改变死亡的许多方面，从处理受感染身体的实际情况到满足留守者的精神和情感需求。\n在爱尔兰，卫生局建议太平间工作人员在尸体上戴上口罩，以降低即使是轻微的感染风险。在意大利，一家殡仪公司正在使用视频链接，允许被隔离的家庭观看牧师为死者祝福。而在韩国，对病毒的恐惧导致送葬人数的下降，以至于殡仪服务商都在为生意苦苦挣扎。\n负责墓地的当地官员吉亚科莫·安杰洛尼说，在米兰东北部的贝尔加莫等重灾城市，几乎没有时间举行仪式，那里的太平间已经爆满，火葬场24小时都在工作。\n他说，贝加莫是大约12万人的家园，目前处理的死亡人数是平时的5-6倍。\n目前，意大利已报告近3000人死于冠状病毒引起的COVID-19，这是该病毒首次出现的中国以外地区死亡人数最多的国家. 意大利军队星期三派出50名士兵和15辆卡车前往贝加莫，将尸体运往不太拥挤的省份。\n英国慈善机构Cruse丧亲关怀的首席运营官Andy Langford说，禁止集会打破了帮助我们悲伤的重要仪式。\n他说：“葬礼可以让一个群体聚在一起，表达情感，谈论那个人，正式地说再见。”。\n他说：“当你觉得自己无法控制如何悲伤，也无法控制如何与某人共度最后时刻，这会使你的悲伤变得复杂，让你感觉更糟。”。\n额外工作人员\n据伊朗国家电视台报道，伊朗和意大利北部一样，医院和殡仪馆的工作人员都被尸体压垮，病毒已经在全国蔓延，造成1284人死亡，数千人感染。\n德黑兰Behesht-e Zahra公墓的一位经理说，当局雇用了新的人来挖掘坟墓。”“我们日夜工作，”他说我从未见过如此悲惨的局面。没有葬礼。”\n他说，大多数尸体是用卡车运来的，埋葬时没有按照伊斯兰教规定的仪式清洗。\n一些伊朗人怀疑，官方急于埋葬他们，更多的是为了掩盖不断上升的死亡人数，而不是阻止病毒的传播。\n距德黑兰约三小时车程的卡山市一名医院工作人员告诉路透社记者，从COVID-19死亡的记录是心脏病发作或肺部感染。\n“官员们在死亡人数上撒谎，”这名工人说在过去几天里，我看到了几十具尸体，但他们告诉我们不要谈论此事。”伊朗医院的两名护士也告诉路透社，他们认为死亡人数高于官方统计数字。\n伊朗当局拒绝了有关掩盖真相的指控，伊朗总统鲁哈尼在3月1日的电视讲话中说. 他18日说，他的政府一直“对国家诚实直率”\n感染风险\n在一些国家，葬礼之后出现了成簇的感染。在韩国，已经有90多人死亡，政府敦促19名遇难者的家属先火化他们的亲人，然后再举行葬礼。\n韩国的葬礼通常在医院举行，包括三天的祈祷和宴会。该国早期的病例大多与大邱市的一座教堂和附近一个县的一家医院有关。今年2月，耶稣新禅宗教会的几名成员在医院参加了该教会创立者兄弟的葬礼。\n韩国殡葬协会秘书长崔敏浩说，自疫情爆发以来，无论死者是否携带病毒，参加葬礼的悼念者人数已经下降了90%。\n他说：“葬礼的文化发生了重大变化。”为数不多的哀悼者迅速表示哀悼，出于对感染的担忧，他们不在一起吃饭就离开了这里。”\n他补充说，传统上以现金形式交付的慰问金现在通过银行转账。\n武汉是中国爆发疫情的中心，也是其死亡的主要地点，当局很快将殡葬业确定为潜在的传染源。\n当地民政局1月下旬下令，所有已确认的COVID-19遇难者的葬礼都在汉口区的一家殡仪馆办理。哀悼仪式，通常是中国喧闹的社会活动，随着所有其他公众集会而减少。\n尽管最近几周新病例的数量有所减少，但这些限制仍在实施。殡仪馆的一名工作人员告诉路透社记者，死者家属甚至不允许看到亲人的尸体.\n在中国，死者的骨灰一般会保存在殡仪馆，直到在4月份的清明节等公共假日被带到家庭墓地。今年也取消了。\n“死亡管理”\n在西班牙，也有大量病例被追查到2月下旬在北部城镇维托利亚举行的葬礼。据当地媒体报道，至少60名参加活动的人在活动结束后检测呈阳性。\n西班牙有600多人死亡，是欧洲仅次于意大利的第二大受灾国家，现在大多数人只能呆在家里。在提到这些限制时，佩德罗·桑切斯总理称冠状病毒是一种“残忍”的疾病，它使人们无法进行社交活动。\n在爱尔兰，到目前为止，所有的葬礼仍允许100名宾客参加。但大多数家庭选择举行小型私人仪式，并鼓励其他人通过RIP.ie等网站在网上表达哀悼，这些网站通常张贴死亡通知和葬礼请柬。\n根据爱尔兰健康与安全管理局（Health and Safety Executive）给葬礼负责人的最新指导方针，任何冠状病毒感染者都将举行开棺式葬礼，“应该建议家属不要亲吻死者”。\n公共卫生官员说，从尸体上感染冠状病毒的风险很小，但一些国家建议采取额外措施。\n以色列没有报告冠状病毒死亡，但其卫生部说，死者应该用不透水的塑料双层包装。仪式清洗和仪式将在全套保护装备和尸体重新包装在塑料埋葬。通常，以色列的犹太死者被安置在布罩衫和裹尸布中休息。\n爱尔兰的指导方针建议殡仪馆的工作人员在移动尸体前给尸体戴上口罩，以防他们“从肺部排出极少量的空气和病毒液滴”，感染活人.\n在大流行仍在加速的英国，人们普遍担心可能造成的死亡人数。\n英国在执行欧洲其他地方的严格措施方面进展缓慢，专家估计有多少人将死于COVID-19，范围从几万到几十万不等。\n一项应对该病毒的紧急法案已经在英国造成104人死亡，其中包括一些政府称将“简化死亡管理程序”的措施。这些措施包括允许殡仪馆馆长代表一个自我隔离的家庭登记死亡。\n美国全国殡葬导演协会发言人黛博拉·史密斯（Deborah Smith）表示，这项法案将帮助殡葬行业“保护那些死去的人的尊严，用同情之心照顾他们的亲人——即使他们无法举行他们想要的那种葬礼。”\n史密斯不愿透露预期数字，但表示“殡仪馆馆长正在为各种情况做准备”\n“不孤单”\n一个场景已经在武汉上演。\n上个月，汉口区殡仪馆一名自称黄姓的工作人员写了一篇文章，在社交媒体上流传。他说，殡仪馆的工作人员和市里的医护人员一样不知所措，但得到的认可较少。\n他说，疫情开始以来，工作人员一直在不间断地工作。”我们的一些员工甚至不喝水，因为他们需要上厕所，很难脱下防护服，”他写道。\n半个世界之外，在病毒肆虐的意大利小镇贝加莫，殡葬工人们进行了一场几乎相同的斗争。\n“这就像是在与一个看不见的敌人交战，”贝加莫葬礼服务中心的合伙人罗伯塔·卡普里尼说我们已经连续两周不间断地工作，每天晚上睡3-4个小时. 我们这一地区的每个人，包括我们在内，都有人在家里失去亲人或生病。”\n贝尔加莫的万圣教堂已经变成了一个临时停尸房，它的长椅被推到一边以容纳死者。卡普里尼说，她在星期二参观时至少数了60具棺材。\n她谈到那些看着生病的亲属被送往医院，再也没有见到他们的家庭所感受到的“真正的折磨”。她的公司已经安排了葬礼的视频链接，让家人观看牧师祝福死者。\n她说，有时候，他们会把灵车开过死者家属的家，所以哀悼者“至少可以在此刻下来，快速祈祷。”",

Overall figures indicate that covid-19 is most dangerous in patients already suffering from health problems and among the older population. However, the death of the teenager in that country is giving more force to the warnings that have been issued by experts: young adults and children are not immune to the risk of infection and suffer serious consequences.\nUS President Donald Trump urged his fellow citizens to stand united. \"I want the Americans to know that we will overcome this challenge. Normal life will return,\"he said. Although he continually referred to the coronavirus as a \"Chinese virus\", Trump stated that Asian Americans should not be held accountable. Trump assured him that he would not let \"healing be worse than the problem itself\". \"This is a medical problem. We will not let the coronavirus become a long-term financial problem,\"he added. US health authorities have registered over a hundred deaths in a single day, which raises the death toll to 545 across the country.\nFormer film producer Harvey Weinstein, arrested for rape and sexual abuse, is infected with coronavirus. Information has come from the state's correctional authorities in New York, where he is serving a 23-year prison sentence.\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicated that there are only five reasons to leave the house: to buy food, exercise once a day, go to the doctor or pharmacist, go to work (but only if it is not even possible to work from home) and help vulnerable peoplYeah. Leaving the house under any other circumstances is prohibited. \"We will get to the point where no health care system in the world can handle this virus,\" said the head of the British Government.\nLearn about the \"German exception\" link and what explains a lethality rate of only 0.3%. Angela Merkel received the first test result, which was negative. The German chancellor has been in quarantine since Sunday, after a doctor with whom she had been positive about the virus. In the meantime, Merkel is surrounded to throw away the coronabonds'taboo. A brief memory exercise: in 2012, at the height of the sovereign debt crisis, the Chancellor assured that there would be European bonds over her dead body that would allow the debt of the euro area to be mutualised. Now, you're probably gonna have to find a coronabond, whatever it is.\nThe Finance Ministers of the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU) endorsed the suspension of budgetary discipline, validating the European Commission proposal freeing governments from the recommended deficit targets. The goal is to increase their margin for manoeuvre so that they can inject more money into fighting the pandemic. Brussels has made it clear that it wants green roads at the borders for the transport of goods. And the EU was also prepared to give financial aid to Venezuela and Iran,'which are in greatest difficulty because of sanctions'.\nDespite the Commission's change of strategy, European fellowships opened in red this Monday. Technologies also tremble: although they are one of the most dynamic sectors in the world and those most capable of teleworking, these characteristics do not render them immune to the impacts of the pandemic. In the US, the Federal Reserve will do unlimited shoppinYeah.\nAccording to a review carried out by Agency France-Presse, more than one billion people in more than fifty countries or territories are confined to their homes by the order of their authorities. But the WHO warns that containment may not be enough to defeat the virus.\nOn the African continent, the most affected country, South Africa, has announced that its citizens will be in isolation from Thursday. In Ethiopia, the strategy is to close the land borders.\nIn India too, there are stricter containment measures and internal flights are suspended.\nIn Brazil, Rio de Janeiro is quarantined and only supermarkets and pharmacies are left open.\nThe day was also marked by the unknown regarding the Tokyo Olympic Games. Canada has started by ensuring that if the Olympics take place this year, the country will not send its athletes to Tokyo. The Japanese Prime Minister stated that \"annulment is not a possibility\", but acknowledged that postponing the competition \"may be inevitable\". In an interview with USA Today newspaper, Dick Pound, the most senior member of the International Olympic Committee, said that the decision to postpone the Games is \"made\". It is already \"certain\" that the proof, which was supposed to start the 24th of July, \"will not start on that date,\" he assured.\nIn the environment, good news: pollution levels are falling significantly worldwide with the pandemic. Another good news in the line of fighting the virus through 3D printing: visors, masks and fans are being manufactured a little throughout the world, including in Portugal.\nOne bad news: tourism loses one million jobs every day at global level.\nAnd in closing, the WHO warns of fraud in full pandemic",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Sir, sir.\nPresident of the Portuguese Republic\nDr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa,\nFirst of all, I would like to congratulate you on having declared the state of emergency in Portugal and on your subsequent speech to the country. Indeed, the times we live in are terrible and merciless. And they have no pity or hesitation.\nThat's why your word and action are important. Personally, I was also very pleased that there was almost unanimity in answering this question by the Assembly of the Republic and the Government. But now, in the very short time available to us (and which is being shortened by the hour) more and more needs to be done, of a health and political nature!\nI therefore appeal to you, as a Portuguese and a European citizen, to exert your enormous symbolic and diplomatic influence on countries or regions that have shared historical, commercial and mutual help relations with Portugal for more than 500 years now, so that you can help us now, at this time of enormous need. Of course, I am talking about Japan and the People's Republic of China, with special emphasis on the Macao Special Administrative RegioYeah. Indeed, fruit of having had to deal with the SARS epidemic at the beginning of this millennium and now with that of Covid-19, China and its Special Administrative Regions are prepared like no other country, with possible exceptions from Japan and South Korea, to help us in this fight which, Having now come to us in a most astonishing way, he will not soon let us sleep soundly!\nThis aid should not only be of a material nature, with its protective, diagnostic and treatment equipment (e.g. masks, medicines and fans) that we already have and will be increasingly lacking in our NHS, as the situation gets worse, but also and perhaps above all, should be through sharing epidemiological knowledge and public health! In fact, it is high time that we had foreign experts to help us, especially in Lisbon and with the government, and, if this is not possible, at least with the help of videoconferences, to advise advisers, advisors and, ideally and directly, those responsible for conducting this fight, Mr President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Health and the Director of the DGS. Not to mention the specialized council of the members of the National Board of Health or at least evident National Public Health Council!\nMr President, I have had my students without classes for more than a week, but our teachers are doing their best, as are many other teachers across the country, to try to mitigate this situation by giving distance lessons. But much worse, I also have countless colleagues and friends who have long since clashed in emergency rooms, in the wards and in intensive care of St John's University Hospital Centre, committed to tracking down and treating patients with Covid-19 and adding to their usual patientYeah. And at this moment, beating each other almost as much as much before had been done by their grandparents or great-grandparents in the trenches of the First War in La Lys. And if we consider what remains to be done to reach the peak of the epidemic, we are still at the beginning of its progression in Portugal.\nIn other words, Mr President, in a time of absolute truth and emergency, it is time for us not to be afraid to confess our own limitations as a country, as politicians or even as experts, and, recognising this, it is time to ask for help from those who are best able to help us!\nAnd above all, not forgetting that delaying or postponing it, just for a day or a few hours, from a correct decision to isolate the population more narrowly or to screen more intensively cases in the population could prevent the death of a very considerable number of Portuguese people. Moreover, when the current number of deaths in Portugal, as in all other countries, will be underestimated, by possible non-recognition of Covid-19's diagnosis at the time of the registration of our patients'deaths, and also by excessive deaths, in patients not infected with Covid-19, by SNS overload.\nWith the best personal and institutional compliments",

David Stilwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very \"stern representation\" to China's ambassador Cui Tiankai.  \n Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Monday that in the phone call Yang told Pompeo that attempts to smear China's efforts to control the coronavirus \"will not succeed\" and that actions that harmed China's interests would be retaliated against.  \n The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has spread around the world, upended many countries' daily lives, pummeled financial markets, brought flights to a standstill, shut down schools and forced the postponement of almost all gatherings including sports and arts events.  \n Globally over 174,100 have been infected and nearly 6,700 have died. U.S. death toll reached 71, with more than 4,100 people having tested positive for the disease.  \n Beijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people.  \n Pompeo, who has sharply criticised Beijing on a number of issues from its trade practices to religious freedoms, has complained that the U.S. response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.  \n However on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised China for its \"data sharing\" and appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

That is well below a Feb. 29 peak of 909.  \n South Korea has 8,236 confirmed infections - the highest number in Asia outside China - while the death toll rose by four to 79, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).  \n Another 303 patients had been released after recovering, bringing the number of those who had gone home to 1,137.  \n \"Unless there are unexpected developments, we expect this trend will also gain momentum,\" Moon said during a meeting with health officials at Seoul City Hall. \"Our confidence that we can overcome COVID-19 is growing.\"  \n Both Moon and other officials warned against complacency - their remarks coming on the same day that the central bank, in a bid to soften the economic impact of the virus, cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in an emergency meeting, taking it below 1% for the first time ever.  \n \"For three straight days we have seen more numbers of discharged than newly confirmed, but we should not forget the lessons we’ve learned,\" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing.  \n There were new clusters from unknown sources in cities other than the hardest hit city of Daegu, Kim said, adding: \"This implies the coronavirus is spreading across the country.\"  \n In Seongnam, south of Seoul, at least 46 members of a Protestant church have tested positive, including the pastor, after services on March 1 and March 8, despite government calls to cancel mass gatherings.  \n \"We have traced 46 confirmed patients linked to the church in Seongnam city since March 9. We are still investigating who those patients had contact with,\" KCDC chief Jeong Eun-kyeong told reporters.  \n Forty other people who came in contact with infected church members also tested positive, he said, noting the cluster was the second-largest in the Seoul metropolitan area.  \n Kim urged people to avoid mass gatherings and adopt \"social distancing\" measures. \"We should not let our guard down.\"  \n This week, South Korea adopted tougher border checks for visitors from Europe, similar to its rules for travellers from China and Iran.  \n The foreign ministry on Monday escalated its travel advisory level for 36 countries in Europe from 1 to 2, the second of four ratings, asking citizens to refrain from travel to the region. The countries affected include Italy, Germany, France and Spain.  \n On Sunday, the government classified the worst-hit South Korean provinces as \"special disaster zones\", allowing the government to subsidise up to half of restoration expenses and exempt residents from taxes and utility payments.

This is a shortened version of the full feature,​ which can be found here. \n SINGAPORE — Earlier this month, Dr Chng Woei was asked by her 24-year-old daughter if the family was not going to have dinner with the maternal grandparents until “this dies down”.   \n “This” refers to the Covid-19 crisis which has hit every continent except Antarctica, and has earlier this week been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.  \n And dinner with the elderly folks was out of the question till the situation improves, the general practitioner (GP) replied to her daughter.  \n The 51-year-old, who works at Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, would rather be safe than sorry. Since the clinic is a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC), a network of clinics providing subsidised treatment and medication during public health outbreaks, she could never be certain if the next patient she sees is a Covid-19 carrier, and her worst fear is that she may end up transmitting the virus to her parents who are in their 80s.  \n That is why she has restricted her family’s visits to her parents’ house to less than 30 minutes each time. Even then, they would not have dinner together, unlike before.  \n Dr Leong Choon Kit, 53, who runs Mission Medical Clinic in Serangoon, is keeping a distance of at least one metre from his loved ones, including his wife and teenage daughter. \n That means sleeping on a foldable mattress at night, while his wife takes the spot on the bed. And there are no hugs and kisses too, he added. \n Sacrifices such as these have become part and parcel of life for those working on the frontline in the fight against the highly contagious Covid-19 virus in Singapore, which has seen a total of 200 confirmed cases as of Friday (March 13). \n For more than a month now, frontline healthcare workers have been grappling with lost time with family members and disruptions to their personal routines and plans.  \n Many have to endure working long hours under a plasticky nursing gown, goggles that could fog up, an N95 mask so snugly-fitted that it could cause a headache over prolonged use, a shower cap and gloves.  \n They also have to deal with the mental strain of having to keep up with constantly changing standard operating protocols and definitions of suspect cases as the Covid-19 situation rapidly evolves. \n  Ms Ong Zh Hua, an assistant nurse clinician at Tan Tock Seng Hospital who works in both the screening centre and emergency department, writes her name on a gown that she wears as part of personal protective equipment (PPE). Healthcare workers wearing full PPE at the hospital sometimes write their names on their gowns to make it is easier to identify each other. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a senior doctor juggling duties between TTSH’s Emergency Department and the NCID, told TODAY that they are at “version 43” of their clinical protocol as of Thursday — just 50 days after the first Covid-19 case was announced here.  \n In recognition of their invaluable role, along with the sacrifices that come with it, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced in Parliament on Feb 28 that public officers directly battling the disease will get a special bonus of up to one month, while a one-off Covid-19 grant will be given to 900 PHPCs, including more than 600 GP clinics, which had been activated to deal with the public health crisis.  \n As Singaporeans adjust to living with Covid-19, TODAY spoke to some 20 frontline workers to get a glimpse of how their lives had been upended by the pandemic.  \n MITIGATING RISK IN THE FAMILY \n In the initial days of the outbreak, when alarming numbers of reported deaths from China dominated the news daily and struck fear in the hearts of many, Dr Leong could sense from chat groups that many of his peers in the GP community were “very stressed out”.  \n One Sunday in early February, Dr Leong, who doubles up as a leader of a primary care network under the Ministry of Health (MOH), got a call from a fellow GP.  \n The caller asked Dr Leong to look after his young children should he die from the virus, and to explain to them how he died when they are older. \n “It is still early! Why are we talking about dying?” Dr Leong remembered saying in reply. \n Dr Philip Koh, 54, a GP with a Healthway Medical branch in Tampines, said a young doctor had also shared with him that for the first time, he had told his father “I love you”, just in case he dies from Covid-19. \n While such anxiety has since subsided as more scientific information of the virus emerges, some GPs today, especially those with young kids and elderly parents, still remain adamant about not taking chances in risking the lives of their loved ones. \n Among them is Dr Lee, a GP who goes beyond the MOH requirements to wear the full PPE for every single patient he sees.  \n Inevitably, his outfit had attracted the attention of some of his patients, said the doctor who declined to give his full name.  \n But the 35-year-old, who practises in an Aljunied clinic and works part-time as a locum, would explain to them that it is his way of protecting his two-year-old daughter who is also looked after by his parents who are entering their 70s.  \n “When I go to work, the first thing I care about is my daughter and my family. Although I care about my patients, my family comes first… I don’t want to infect them. If an elderly gets it, it becomes bad and can turn into an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) case,” said Dr Lee, whose wife is also a GP.  \n  Dr Ng Wei Xiang, a doctor at Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Emergency Department. For Big Read on Covid-19 frontline healthcare workers. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n DEALING WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT UPFRONT  \n The full PPE is all the more necessary for him, as he had observed a trend of patients making false declarations that they had no respiratory symptoms at the front counter of the clinic, only to “ambush” him by coming clean to him about their runny nose, sore throat or cough in the consultation room. \n Typically, a clinic following PHPC guidelines would have triage staff segregating patients who better fit Covid-19 suspect case definition from other patients to minimise any cross-transmission. The process also ensures that the GP could be forewarned to don the PPE before seeing higher-risk patients.  \n Dr Lee got so irritated with such irresponsible behaviour that he decided to take a tally during a shift on March 5, and found that five out of the 20 patients he saw within a two-hour period were not upfront about their medical condition.  \n “It beats me why they don’t declare… They lie even when the triage staff warned them twice about the consequences of what might happen to them if they don’t declare,” said Dr Lee. \n “I put my life on the line to help, so I am asking the public to be more socially responsible.” \n MANPOWER SHORTAGES, FAMILY MEMBERS CHIPPING IN  \n Dr Clarence Yeo, from Killiney Medical Clinic in the River Valley area, had been working almost daily since February. He believes this would be “useful for the patients”, since MOH had advised that a patient should be reviewed by the same GP if they continued to develop symptoms after consulting one. \n The 47-year-old GP who sees an average of 50 to 60 patients daily — about half of them coming in with fever, flu or cough — said he will wait for the number of Covid-19 cases here to dwindle before considering taking leave. \n Asked when that might be, he said: “It is very hard to predict. We can’t say the next month, May, or June.”  \n Regardless, he is ready to put in the hours for as long as the outbreak drags on. \n In his second televised address to the nation on the Covid-19 situation on March 12, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the outbreak “will continue for some time — a year, and maybe longer”. \n GPs are not the only ones who are struggling with staffing woes. Manpower shortages and extra shifts are also common at restructured hospitals.  \n TTSH’s Dr Ng’s most memorable shift took place on Feb 5, the day after MOH announced Singapore’s first four cases of local transmission detected at Yong Thai Hang, a Chinese health products shop at Cavan Road in Lavender. \n It happened to be his very first shift at NCID and an unexpected crowd of 300 worried individuals flocked to the screening centre to get checked for Covid-19, after MOH said it would be getting in touch with people who had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland China. \n Dr Ng was the only senior doctor rostered with five junior doctors then.  \n “That was a very, very bad shift, but we survived because people came from all over to help,” said the 33-year-old.  \n Before he knew it, manpower was diverted from the team manning the Emergency Department. Two consultants, two registrars and a few more doctors arrived to help at short notice. \n And not once did he sense anyone having the attitude of “it is not my problem. I am not manning this post”. “They asked if I needed help even before I asked for help,” said Dr Ng. \n BEYOND N95-INFLICTED ‘BATTLE SCARS’  \n Now imagine having to deal with all these work contingencies while running around covered by a humid, overheated “shell”— the full PPE — amid muggy weather this past fortnight.  \n Indeed, the hospital frontline workers told TODAY it is common now to end their work day drenched in their own perspiration and dehydrated, as they were reluctant to drink more water, just in case they might need to “degown” often for toilet breaks.  \n Besides getting “battle scars”— facial imprints, pressure sores, abrasions and even blisters on their nose bridge left behind by prolonged N95 use — some frontline workers are also getting pimple outbreaks. \n  Mr Benjamin Ong, a senior staff nurse at the Department of Emergency Medicine at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, takes a selfie showing his facial marks, or what he calls “battle scars”, left behind by a N95 mask after a day’s work. Photo: Benzeemin/Instagram \n MORALE BOOSTERS \n With all the myriad of challenges, work days now seem to be longer for frontline healthcare workers.  \n The long shifts get more bearable these days, thanks to morale boosters coming in the form of food, presents and “thank you” notes from members of the public — a marked change from before when some healthcare workers donning their uniforms found themselves being ostracised in public.  \n The nurses and doctors said they are thankful for the chicken rice, nasi lemak, cookies, bubble tea, skin care products and flowers, among other things, that come their way.  \n But the gifts that take away all their fatigue are usually the extra special ones from their families. \n For TTSH’s Dr Ng, that pick-me-up came via a WhatsApp message during a hectic work day, sent to him from his son’s preschool teacher. It was a photo of his five-year-old holding up a drawing paper on which he wrote: “I love you. Thank you for saving Singapore.” \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON - The U.S. State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States on Friday to protest against comments by Beijing suggesting the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, as tensions between the two global powers over the outbreak intensified.  \n David Stillwell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, delivered a very \"stern representation\" to China's ambassador Cui Tiankai, a State Department official said, adding that Beijing's envoy was \"very defensive.\"  \n The State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in \"starting a global pandemic and not telling the world.\"  \n \"Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous. We wanted to put the government on notice we won't tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.\"  \n Defence Department Spokeswoman Alyssa Farah wrote on Twitter on Friday that \"the Communist Party of China has chosen to promulgate false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 blaming U.S. service members. #ChinaPropaganda\"  \n The virus, also called COVID-19, has infected 138,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,000.  \n China's embassy did not respond to requests for comment.  \n Despite the signs of tension, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Beijing on Friday for its \"data sharing\".  \n Asked by a reporter during a White House news conference about \"odd narratives\" being offered by some Chinese officials, Trump appeared to brush off any concern, saying he had read one article on the subject, but that he did not think it was representative of his discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  \n Trump, who in a national address this week called the outbreak a \"foreign virus\" that started in China, added: \"They know where it came from, we all know where it came from.\"  \n Tensions escalated after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian took to Twitter on Thursday.  \n \"When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\" Zhao tweeted in English.  \n The episode is the latest in an increasing war of words between Washington and Beijing, whose already strained ties over issues including trade, intellectual property rights and press freedom have further been tested by the virus outbreak.  \n The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, pummelling financial markets, halting industry, bringing some flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sports events and concerts.  \n Zhao's comments came days after Robert O'Brien, the U.S. national security adviser, said China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing.  \n Wuhan was ground zero for the outbreak, which the World Health Organization this week labelled a pandemic. It has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide, including nearly 81,000 in mainland China, and killed more than 5,000 people.  \n Beijing was criticized for initially attempting to censor some Chinese doctors who sounded an alarm over the virus. Since January, it has imposed draconian containment measures, effectively locking down Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, home to 60 million people.  \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has complained that the U.S. response had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from Beijing.  \n He and several other U.S. politicians have angered Beijing by referring to the \"Wuhan virus.\" In a national address on Wednesday, Trump called the outbreak a \"foreign virus\" that started in China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Europe is now the epicentre of the pandemic. The online newspaper \"Politico\" gave a comprehensive guide to the measures being taken by European countries to deal with Covid-19. Portugal, which is part of this ranking, is one of the countries that has already implemented exceptional measures and is in a state of alert: schools and universities are closed and events in enclosure covered with more than a thousand prohibited people. But if the disease gets out of hand, the government is likely to go ahead with even more restrictive measures. Look at what is happening in Europe, country by country:\nItaly\nThe second country in the world most affected by the disease, after China, has all schools, universities, shops and restaurants closed until at least three in April, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies. And people can only leave the house for reasons considered to be of prime need. Anyone who wants to travel from one city to another must have a completed form about the reasons for the journey. Any false information provided to the authorities is considered a crime. Major events such as shows and football games are suspended. The degree of panic among the population is considered by the high politician.\nJON NAZCA\nSpain\nAll Spaniards were restricted by being forced to stay home because of Covid-19. A decision this Saturday by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. As in Italy, they can only leave the house if they are buying first-needed products, medicines in a pharmacy or if they need to go to a hospital. The country lives in a state of alarm for the second time in democracy. And all the police and armed forces were mobilized. All flights to and from Italy were cancelled and thousands of passengers were stranded at Madrid and Barcelona airports after some countries closed their doors to people from flights from SpainYeah.

Many of the sporting events continue to take place but behind closed doors. This Friday, the government announced that it will give unlimited credit to companies by injecting fifty billion euros into the economy. Civil Protection has a pre-Covid-19 guide on food stocks, suggesting that the Germans should keep food like bread, potatoes or nuts. It also suggests the storage of 20-litres of liquids per person, preferably bottled. The country also allows trucks to move on German roads on Sundays.

Schools only close if there are infected students or teachers. But two cases have already been confirmed at Oxford and Bournemouth universities, but the institutions have remained open. Sports events have not been cancelled but many of them are fighting behind closed doors. And the government has made efforts not to shut down the live shows. 12 billion pounds and tax cuts were injected to mitigate the effect of the new coronavirus. The level of alert among the population is average, appreciably equal to that of the Germans and the Netherlands.Yeah.\nBelgium\nNot all tourists returning from holiday in Italy have been quarantined.

And the sporting events suspended for the same period. The shopping centers are closed on weekends, with only supermarkets and pharmacies open. The alert level among the population is high.\nThe same is true in countries such as Ireland, Poland and Romania, which are subject to restrictive measures to contain the virus. Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, Croatia and Estonia have lower alert levels, some because they have few cases of infected people, others because they are far from the most affected countries.",

The cases confirmed by the new coronavirus, originating in Wuhan in central China, are approaching round 100 thousand. More than half of the affected have healed (3200 deaths).\nAfter the Chinese Government's failure to act successfully on the outbreak, after decoding what the virus is and how it navigates, the traditional recommendations to successfully act in community, quarantines, economic coups, alarms and excesses that in some cities have led to the race for supermarkets, fear, the scenarios, forecasts, reflections and comparisons, the mechanisms activated to treat the infected and any infected, the problem remains: to contain the spread.\nInformation updated at 13am on Thursday, 5th in March\nJohns Hopkins Center.\nThe first stage of this story was to put a stop to the spread of Covid-19, which has packed its bags and is travelling around the world, hence the status of a pandemic. Only in China there are over 80 thousand confirmed cases, while in South Korea they rose to more than 6000. Around here, in Europe, Italy leads the ranking that nobody wants to lead, with more than 3000 infected. Iran is in the fourth world place, despite some advances and setbacks in communication transparency, with almost 3000 patients.\nThe outbreak of the new coronavirus forced governments to take action, some of them by erecting invisible walls and tightening borders and access. In other words, there is a vast travel restriction; the doors have closed for certain passengers. This Bloomberg article, based on data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), helps to understand the real size of this new world.\nLet us start with the Italian case in close proximity to Portugal.Yeah. The country has now refused flights from China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Russia has shut the door on Chinese and passport holders from Hong Kong and Macao.\nThe United States denies entry to foreigners who had travelled to China in the two weeks prior to arrival. Americans who have been in that Asian country are automatically quarantined for 14 days.\nJapan rejects passengers who have been in places in China such as Hubei, Daegu, Cheongdo and Zhejiang in the previous 14 days. Australia and New Zealand are more or less on the same page, banning travellers from China and Iran. In the case of Australians, restrictions are extended to passengers who have been on the Diamond Princess cruise, which is based in Yokohama, Japan.\nIran, for example, does not receive any Chinese citizens and passengers with Covid-19 symptoms. This measure prohibits the blind entry of Chinese passengers extends to other countries such as Paraguay, Guatemala, Trinidad Tobago, Belize, the Cayman Islands, Somalia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.\nOman goes further and extends this list to passengers from China, Italy and Iran. Turkey, which currently feeds a diplomatic war with the European Union and Greece using migrants and refugees, has banned visitors arriving (or having been in the previous 14 days) from countries such as China, Iran, Iraq, Italy and Korea. South.\nVietnam, in addition to having cancelled air links with China, denies entry into the country to which it passed in the previous 14-day travelers who have crossed the territories of South Korea, Iran and Italy are quarantined for 14 days. Indonesia does not receive anyone who has been to China in the previous two weeks.\nKazakhstan, for example, bordering China, has only swept the map of Iranian citizens arriving.Yeah.\nAngola, by the way, is the one that tightens the grip on the rules (and, hopefully, the virus) on the African continent, making it impossible for passengers to land (or have passed) from Algeria, China, Egypt, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Nigeria to arrive.\nThe data published by Bloomberg and IATA, which are not fully mentioned in this text, are updated by March 5th this Thursday.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "On March 2, Indonesia finally confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 infection. \n This came after weeks of denial by the government and bizarre reactions by various public officials, raising questions on Jakarta’s priorities and preparedness in dealing with the issue. \n Following China’s announcement of its first fatality on Jan 11, the general attitude in Indonesia was that the virus that caused Covid-19 was strictly a foreign issue and would not enter the country. \n After a cabinet meeting on the issue on Jan 25, President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo announced a number of measures to offset possible ramifications for the domestic economy.  \n Tellingly, none of the measures were aimed at ramping up public health readiness to deal with a possible viral outbreak, a likely scenario given Indonesia’s trade links with China. \n Throughout February, as neighbouring countries such as Singapore and Malaysia reported cases of Covid-19 infection, the Indonesian government kept insisting that the country had no infections. \n Harvard University's Professor Marc Lipsitch said on Feb 11 that his research suggested it was almost impossible that there were no infected individuals in Indonesia, given its volume of air travel links with Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. He cited underreporting to explain Indonesia’s zero-infection status. This was vehemently denied by Jakarta.           \n Indonesian Health Minister Dr Terawan Agus Putranto called the study an “insult” to Indonesia and attributed the zero infection statistics to the “strength of prayer” and “protection from the Almighty”. \n He also claimed that his ministry was following World Health Organization procedures to detect the virus. \n However, an Indonesian migrant worker returning from Hong Kong in early March professed to local media her “bewilderment” at the lack of proper checks such as temperature scanning at the Juanda Airport in Surabaya. She had only been asked to fill in a form.   \n February also saw the repatriation of 238 Indonesian citizens from Wuhan. Although they were quarantined and observed for 14 days, it later transpired that they were never medically tested for the virus. \n Achmad Yurianto, a Health Ministry official, defended the decision by claiming that none of the 238 displayed any symptoms for respiratory disease and therefore required no laboratory tests, even though asymptomatic transmissions have been documented elsewhere. \n It was difficult to avoid the impression that Jakarta was burying its head in the sand.   \n Even after the formal confirmation of Covid-19 infections, Jakarta seemed reluctant to roll out comprehensive measures to curb the outbreak. \n It is also worth noting that the two infected individuals were tested after alerting the authorities themselves. \n The mother and daughter from Depok had gone to a hospital themselves after falling ill. The hospital misdiagnosed the daughter with bronchitis and the mother with typhus. \n The daughter, a professional dancer by the name of Sita, then learnt that a female Japanese tourist who had been at an event she had hosted was diagnosed with the virus in Malaysia. \n Ms Sita informed the hospital this and asked to be tested for Covid-19. To her horror, however, she learned about her positive status not from the hospital but on television when she saw a press conference by Mr Widodo. \n A leak of their personal details alleged by someone in the government then led to the pair being trolled online, with fake news being circulated that the tourist was a man and Ms Sita had “danced with him in a nightclub”. \n Many Indonesian social media users even professed having no sympathy for Ms Sita because she had been infected “by behaving loosely”. \n The public hounding of Indonesia’s first two Covid-19 victims may have the undesirable effect of dissuading more Indonesians with symptoms from coming forward, knowing they may be stigmatised when they are found to be infected.  \n It certainly does not help when the religious establishment, represented by the Indonesian Council of Ulema, also supports the idea that there is something un-Islamic about being infected with Covid-19. \n In a press release on March 3, the government-funded body claimed that as long as Indonesian Muslims do not eat anything “haram” or unclean according to the Quran, they are safe from Covid-19. \n It said the virus is “a rebuke from Allah” for those who eat “unclean food, such as pork, human blood or live animals, which always bring diseases”. \n Given that Vice President Ma’ruf Amin is also the outfit’s chairman, its statement is likely to have been sanctioned by the government. \n Days before the statement, Mr Amin himself had reiterated the view that Indonesia’s “zero-infection” status was due to divine protection. “Many clerics recite the qunut (dawn prayer), including myself, which is why the coronavirus is banished from Indonesia,” he said. \n The haphazard way in which the Indonesian government has reacted to the Covid-19 outbreak underscores its fear that it will trigger mass hysteria among Indonesians as well as of the negative economic repercussions. \n This would explain why, even after the confirmation of infections on March 2, Mr Widodo still boasted that Indonesia is somehow benefitting from the outbreak. \n On one occasion, he professed himself “pleased” that, thanks to the epidemic, optimism for doing business in Indonesia rose to above 50 per cent while that for China fell to 35.   \n In reality, the country’s public health system is ill-prepared to deal with a full-blown crisis. \n To date, only hospitals and health institutions in Jakarta and Surabaya are capable of testing for Covid-19 with accuracy. Bali, Indonesia’s top tourist destination, has no laboratory which can identify the virus. \n Indonesia’s hospital bed to population ratio is also low at 12 per 10,000, half that of Singapore while there are only 3.9 doctors for every 10,000 Indonesians. The fact it is also an archipelago of 18,000 islands makes any containment effort challenging. \n On March 6, the Indonesian government confirmed two more Covid-19 cases, after tracing 20 people who interacted with the first two cases.   \n While this signals a greater degree of realism and action, Jakarta should have been more transparent with the public from the beginning, instead of trying to play down the threat Covid-19 posed. \n In this internet age where Indonesians can access information readily, running a narrative which was at odds with the rest of the world only resulted in diminished public trust in the government. \n Evidently, Indonesia did not learn much from how it handled the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) pandemic in 2003. \n Although Jakarta set up an emergency fund worth tens of millions of dollars to contain the outbreak, as well as forcibly quarantined individuals suspected of having contracted Sars, it was never transparent about how many Indonesians were infected.  \n The lack of credible data even gave rise to the belief that Sars somehow passed Indonesia by. \n We appear to be seeing a repeat of this now with the Covid-19 outbreak. It is not too late for the Jokowi administration to restore public trust in its ability to contain the virus. \n The central government must also ensure that its steps are in tandem with its counterparts on the regional levels. At the moment, a serious lack of coordination exists. \n Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan for example has ruffled some feathers by declaring a state of emergency in the capital city, though no comprehensive measures have been rolled out. \n Coordinating Minister for Politics, Law and Security Mahfud MD, without mentioning names, has warned regional leaders against using the outbreak to score political points.    \n Time is of the essence here and Indonesia should act now, especially as the country confirmed two more cases on March 8 and can expect more infections in the days ahead.  \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Johannes Nugroho is a writer and political analyst from Surabaya whose commentaries have appeared in the Jakarta Post and Jakarta Globe since the 1990s. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "3月2日，印度尼西亚终于确认了前两例Covid-19感染病例。\n此前数周，印尼政府一直否认这一说法，多名政府官员也做出了奇怪的反应，对雅加达处理这一问题的优先次序和准备程度提出了质疑。\n在中国于1月11日宣布首例死亡后，印尼的普遍态度是，导致Covid-19的病毒严格来说是外国问题，不会进入印尼。\n在1月25日就这一问题举行内阁会议后，佐科总统“佐科维”宣布了一些措施，以抵消可能对国内经济造成的影响\n值得注意的是，这些措施都不是为了增强公共卫生准备，以应对可能的病毒爆发，鉴于印尼与中国的贸易联系，这种情况很可能发生。\n整个2月份，由于新加坡和马来西亚等邻国报告了Covid-19感染病例，印度尼西亚政府一直坚称该国没有感染病例。\n哈佛大学教授马克利普希奇（Marc Lipsitch）2月11日表示，他的研究表明，鉴于印尼与疫情中心武汉之间的航空运输量，印尼几乎不可能没有感染者。他引用报告不足来解释印尼的零感染状况。雅加达对此予以强烈否认\n印尼卫生部长特拉万·阿古斯·普特兰托博士称这项研究是对印尼的“侮辱”，并将零感染的统计数字归因于“祈祷的力量”和“来自全能者的保护”。\n他还声称，他的卫生部正在按照世界卫生组织的程序检测病毒。\n然而，3月初从香港返回的一名印尼务工人员对当地媒体表示，她对泗水“圣达”机场缺乏适当检查，如温度扫描，感到困惑。. 她只被要求填写一张表格\n今年2月，还有238名印尼公民从武汉遣返。尽管他们被隔离观察了14天，但后来发现他们从未接受过病毒的医学检测。\n卫生部官员Achmad Yurianto为这一决定辩护，声称238人中没有一人表现出任何呼吸道疾病症状，因此不需要进行实验室检查，尽管其他地方也有无症状传播的记录。\n很难避免雅加达把头埋在沙子里的印象\n即使在Covid-19感染得到正式确认之后，雅加达似乎也不愿意推出全面措施来遏制疫情的爆发。\n另外值得注意的是，这两名感染者是在向当局本人发出警报后接受检测的。\n德波克的母女生病后自己也去了医院。医院误诊女儿为支气管炎，母亲为斑疹伤寒。\n这位名叫西塔的专业舞蹈演员的女儿随后得知，一名参加过她主办的活动的日本女游客在马来西亚被确诊感染了这种病毒。\n西塔女士将此事告知医院，并要求进行Covid-19检测。然而，令她感到恐惧的是，当她看到维多多的记者招待会时，她并不是从医院而是从电视上了解到自己的积极地位。\n政府中有人指控他们泄露了个人详细信息，随后导致两人在网上被恶搞，假消息传出，游客是一名男子，西塔“在夜总会里和他跳舞”。\n许多印尼社交媒体用户甚至声称对西塔毫无同情，因为她被“行为松散”所感染.\n公众对印尼前两名Covid-19受害者的追捕，可能会产生不良影响，劝阻更多有症状的印尼人挺身而出，因为他们知道一旦被发现感染，可能会受到羞辱\n当以印尼乌莱玛理事会为代表的宗教机构也支持感染Covid-19有非伊斯兰因素的观点时，这当然没有帮助。\n在3月3日的新闻稿中，政府资助的机构声称，只要印尼穆斯林不吃任何“哈拉姆”或不洁的古兰经，他们是安全的从Covid-19。\n它说，这种病毒是对那些吃“不洁食物，如猪肉、人血或活的动物，总是带来疾病”的人的“来自真主的谴责”。\n鉴于副总统马鲁夫·阿明也是该组织的主席，该组织的声明很可能已经得到政府的批准。\n在声明发表前几天，阿明本人曾重申，印尼的“零感染”地位应归功于神的保护。他说：“许多神职人员，包括我在内，都背诵古努特（黎明祈祷），这就是为什么冠状病毒被驱逐出印尼的原因。”。\n印尼政府对Covid-19疫情的随意反应，突显出印尼政府担心这将引发印尼民众的大规模歇斯底里情绪，以及负面的经济影响。\n这就解释了为什么，即使在3月2日确诊感染后，维多多仍然吹嘘印尼从疫情中获益。\n有一次，他声称自己“很高兴”，由于疫情的影响，印尼经商的乐观情绪升至50%以上，而中国的乐观情绪降至35%\n实际上，该国的公共卫生系统还没有做好应对全面危机的准备。\n到目前为止，只有雅加达和泗水的医院和医疗机构能够准确检测Covid-19. 印尼最大的旅游目的地巴厘岛没有能够识别病毒的实验室。\n印尼的病床与人口比率也很低，为每万人12张，是新加坡的一半，而每万印尼人只有3.9名医生。事实上，它也是一个拥有18000个岛屿的群岛，这使得任何遏制努力都具有挑战性。\n3月6日，印尼政府又确认了两起Covid-19病例，此前追踪了20名与前两起病例互动的人\n虽然这标志着更大程度的现实主义和行动，但雅加达从一开始就应该对公众更加透明，而不是试图淡化Covid-19带来的威胁。\n在这个印尼人可以轻易获取信息的互联网时代，这种与世界其他地方格格不入的叙述只会降低公众对政府的信任。\n显然，印度尼西亚在2003年如何处理严重急性呼吸系统综合征（Sars）疫情方面没有学到多少东西。\n尽管雅加达设立了一个价值数千万美元的紧急基金来控制疫情，并对疑似感染非典型肺炎的个人实施了强制隔离，但对有多少印尼人感染非典型肺炎的情况却从来没有公开过\n由于缺乏可靠的数据，人们甚至认为非典不知何故从印度尼西亚过去了。\n我们现在似乎看到，随着Covid-19的爆发，这种情况再次发生。佐科威政府恢复公众对其遏制病毒能力的信任还不算太晚。\n中央政府还必须确保其步骤与区域一级的对应措施同步。目前，严重缺乏协调。\n例如，雅加达省长巴斯韦丹（Anies Baswedan）宣布首都进入紧急状态，虽然还没有出台全面措施，但此举惹恼了一些人.\n负责政治、法律和安全事务的协调部长马赫福德（Mahfud MD）没有提及姓名，但警告地区领导人不要利用疫情来获取政治积分\n时间是关键，印尼现在应该采取行动，特别是3月8日印尼又确认了两例病例，预计未来几天还会有更多感染病例\n \n关于作者：\nJohannes Nugroho是泗水的一位作家和政治分析家，自上世纪90年代以来，他的评论就出现在《雅加达邮报》和《雅加达环球报》上。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The Covid-19 epidemic brought back an expression that was heard frequently during the AIDS epidemic in the last century: \"patient zero\". The expression referred to the person who would have been the first to be infected with the HIV virus and pass it on to others, who would have transmitted it to others, and so on.\nAs far as the new coronavirus is concerned, there are at least two zero patients that are now being sought. One is the first infected in China, which may be extremely difficult to discover, even because there is no consensus on when the epidemic began: the authorities say it was in late December, but a study published in the Lancet refers to the beginning of that month.\nAnother zero patient you're looking for is a person who will have initiated the spread of the virus to countries like South Korea, Malaysia, Spain, France and the United Kingdom. Tracks are centered on a luxury hotel in Singapore. Between 22 and 24 in January, the hotel received an international meeting of Servomex, a British company of gas meters. More than a hundred gifts included people from various parts of the world and many of them would have been carriers of the virus when they left. One of the participants was a businessman named Steve Walsh, who, on his way home, took a little vacation a t a ski resort in the Alps, infecting eleven people who were settled in the same chalet.\nIt has yet to be determined who was the participant in the Singapore meeting that brought the virus there. In fact, it is not even known if it was a member of the company or a hotel employee or anyone else watching. Discovering this is important, not only to understand the route the virus has taken there, but to prevent it from continuing to generate new infected lines. After all, it is quite possible that the person in question does not even know that he is infected.Yeah.\nA virus is mutated as it transmits from animals to humans and then between humans. The changes have known rhythms, which allows, using genetic analysis, an idea of the path followed. Based on that data, you can go back in time and try to get to the ultimate source.\nEven before these scientific tools existed, reconstruction work was already being done. The first famous case of a patient zero (who at the time was not called that, because the expression did not yet exist) would have been that of Mary Mallon, an Irish woman who emigrated to the United States in 1883.\nIn the early 20th century, an epidemic of typhoid fever in areas close to New York and Manhattan alarmed American authorities. An investigator discovered that many of the infected people came from seven homes where Mallon had worked as a cook. The investigator went to see Mary and asked her for blood and urine samples. Mallon refused, finding the whole idea silly, not least because he had no symptoms of the disease.\nWith the cooperation of the police, Mallon was eventually taken by force to a hospital, where the examinations confirmed his suspicions. She was one of those people who transmits the disease virus, but they show virtually no symptoms. She was still in the hospital for a while, but after three years she managed to get her released, against the promise of never working as a cook again.\nSome time later, however, there were further outbreaks of the epidemic, and it was discovered that Mallon had returned to work as a cook in a maternity home, among other places. There was no other remedy but to commit her to the end of her life, because she had broken her commitment, deliberately endangering public health.\nThe most striking example of a patient zero will have been the man who gave rise to the termYeah. When the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, or rather, the perception and alarm, was revealed that the virus had been infecting humans for a long time, a study was carried out on dozens of gay men in the Los Angeles area, who were asked what sexual partners they had had.\nOne name began to appear frequently: Gaetan Dugas, a Canadian airborne host who had had had a large number of different partners. The macabre story is that Dugas, knowing that he was seriously ill, would have intensified his sexual contacts. In the end, he told his partners that he had gay cancer and that from there on, they would have gay cancer, too.\nThe term \"patient 0\" began as a misunderstanding. In the study, Dugas was designated not by that figure but by the letter'O', meaning a patient from outside California ('out of California') later, however, it was concluded that HIV had arrived in the United States in 1969 via Haiti, which in turn had received him from Africa.\nThe long work of reconstruction of the course determined that the virus had passed from animals to humans in Africa in the early 20th century. In other words, it had remained unchanged for many decades. In a dozen different versions transmitted by monkeys, cimpanzees and gorillas, a single one would be responsible for millions of human victims.\nLike HIV and the generality of viruses, Covid-19 also has animal origin. Currently, the most credible speculations pass through snakes and bats. Feces from the latter may have transmitted it to a land animal, perhaps the pangolin, and then to other animals. Among these, some or some who sold themselves on the Wuhan market, known as the epicenter of the ongoing epidemic.\nIn some previous viruses, it was possible to reach a patient zero. The e bola epidemic that killed 11 thousand people in Guinea and other African countries between 2014 and 2016 began with a two-year-old child who used to play in a hollow tree where there was a colony of batsYeah. The SARS epidemic in 2003 originated from a 64-year-old doctor in Hong Kong.\nIn the case of Covid-19, it may not be possible to find the first patient of all, but that may also not be very important or even desirable, even at the risk of being misleading. Officially, there is still no pandemic but a series of epidemics around the world. It will be more relevant in the immediate future to seek out patient zero in each of them.\nIn Italy, for example, this seems to have already happened. El Mundo now says that patient zero of Covid-19 in the country is a 38-year-old man and is receiving a cocktail of medicines where one is commonly used to treat HIV.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — To help the hospitality and tourism-related businesses stay afloat during the Covid-19 outbreak, consumers who are not sick should still dine out, a representative of online travel firm Asia Expedia Group said.  \n “Go out, travel, eat,” Mr Ang Choo Pin, the group’s senior director, said. “Right now is the time for plenty of very good deals.  \n “I've noticed that some of the best restaurants where it was hard to get a reservation for, it's now getting easier. \n “Singaporeans love staycations… and some hotels are offering great deals.” \n His remarks were made during a panel discussion hosted by Singapore’s American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), which released a business survey on Wednesday (Feb 26) showing that the travel and hospitality industries here have been impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak the most. \n Done between Feb 12 and 18 and opened to AmCham Singapore members in these industries, the online survey aimed to understand the outbreak’s impact on companies’ operations, the business environment in Singapore, and the outlook on the region. \n Of the 225 firms that took the survey, 78 per cent of them reported that the coronavirus outbreak has had an extensive or moderate impact on their business operations — both within Singapore and the broader Asia-Pacific. \n For those in the hospitality and travel sector, this figure was 88 per cent. The survey also found that half of those in this sector are expecting more than 20 per cent losses in revenue. \n Analysts told TODAY earlier this month that Singapore’s tourism sector is likely to take a hit in the next six to eight months. \n A fifth of the international visitors here are from China, and visitors who have travelled to China in the past 14 days are banned from entering Singapore during this period. \n As of Wednesday, Singapore is the country with the fifth-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases outside China — after South Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran. \n The governments of India, Israel, Kuwait, Qatar and South Korea have advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Singapore as well.  \n However, Mr Ang of Asia Expedia Group is staying positive and hopeful that things will look up for these industries. \n “One thing we have to bear in mind is that tourism has traditionally been a very resilient industry,” he said. \n Referring to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003 that was caused by a coronavirus, he recalled how the number of arrivals of tourists dropped to 4.7 million but went up to 7 million just two years later. \n “That’s a 40 per cent increase and it rebounded to an extent that was even greater than pre-Sars, so I think it kind of tells you how this might go.” \n CONFIDENCE IN SINGAPORE AS BUSINESS HUB  \n The upside is that the AmCham survey showed that 98 per cent of the firms still have long-term confidence in Singapore as a business hub and destination.  \n A key reason for this is due to the Government’s handling of the outbreak.  \n An overwhelming 97 per cent of the firms in the survey said that the Government has been effective in communicating health and safety updates with regards to the outbreak, while 79 per cent of the firms said that the Government has been effective in addressing the potential economic impact of this public health crisis.  \n SCENARIO PLANNING FOR BUSINESSES \n Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry who was present at the AmCham event, said during a dialogue session that there are three key scenarios Singapore could possibly face in the coming weeks and months. \n Scenario 1  The impact from the outbreak is sharp but there is a “very quick recovery”.  \n This was the case with Sars when the mortality rate was 10 per cent but the outbreak did not last long. The first infected patient landed in Singapore in March 2003 and the country was declared Sars-free in May by the World Health Organization.  \n However, this scenario is unlikely because the Covid-19 coronavirus is infectious but the mortality is very low. Outside of China, less than 1 per cent of patients have died.  \n So this outbreak may last longer than one that has a very high mortality rate. \n Scenario 2 \n The virus takes some time to be eradicated.  \n Mr Chan said: “We must be prepared that if need be, we must put in other measures to work with the businesses to overcome this crisis in a more prolonged time period that was originally envisaged.” \n He also said that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat has already given Singaporeans the assurance that the Government is closely monitoring all measures in the next two to three months to see whether they should be adjusted according to the appropriate conditions and needs. \n Scenario 3 \n The virus mutates into something that causes symptoms similar to the seasonal flu, becoming endemic within the world's population.  \n Singapore may then have to deal with the virus in a similar way that it would a common flu. \n “And then we would then have to find ways to see how we can get back to normalcy (while still taking certain) precautions, Mr Chan said, without elaborating on what these precautions would be.  \n He emphasised that at this point, it is still too premature to say which of the three scenarios will likely take place, but businesses should begin “mental preparations” by using these scenarios to best position themselves for recovery. \n “For those of you who are familiar with the scenario-planning methodology, you will know that we are not trying to forecast which is the scenario.  \n “We are just trying to ask ourselves: If any of these three scenarios happen, are our businesses prepared to handle the consequences of that, and that is how we stress-test our business plan to see whether they are robust enough for the different scenarios.” \n STRENGTH IN UNITY  \n A key point that Mr Chan repeated a few times during the dialogue session was how businesses and Singaporeans need to band together as one. \n “We have to do this together. Big businesses have to help the small businesses and we all have to help each other. We need to have a sense that we are all in this together. \n “If the supply chain breaks, even if it's the smallest part of it, it disrupts the entire supply chain.  \n “In Singapore, we must also distinguish ourselves that unlike places elsewhere, it is not a situation whereby it’s every man for his own. There's a certain communitarian spirit in this, which is that we will get through this, we'll get through this together as one. In order to do that, we have to help each other,” he said. \n ",

For instance, foreign workers may have their work pass privileges revoked and be repatriated, while employers may have their work pass privileges withdrawn. \n Students who flout the notice may face disciplinary action from their institutions, while PRs, long-term visit pass and dependant’s pass holders may have their re-entry permit and their respective passes revoked or validity shortened.  \n The announcement by the ICA follows a similar announcement by the MOH on Wednesday, which saw a married foreign couple being served charges under the Infectious Diseases Act for giving false information while under Covid-19 quarantine order. \n The couple will be charged in court on Friday. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK — Religious pilgrims, migrant workers, businessmen, soldiers and clerics all flow constantly across Iran’s frontiers, often crossing into countries with few border controls, weak and ineffective governments and fragile health systems. \n Now, as it struggles to contain the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus, Iran is also emerging as the second focal point after China for the spread of the disease. Cases in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates — even one in Canada — have all been traced to Iran, sending tremors of fear rippling out from Kabul to Beirut. \n The Middle East is in many ways the perfect place to spawn a pandemic, experts say, with the constant circulation of both Muslim pilgrims and itinerant workers who might carry the virus. Iran’s economy has been strangled by sanctions, its people have lost trust in their government and its leaders are isolated from much of the world, providing little clarity about the extent of the epidemic. \n Civil wars or years of unrest have shattered the health systems of several neighboring countries, like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen. And most of the region is governed largely by authoritarians with poor track records at providing public transparency, accountability and health services. \n “It is a recipe for a massive viral outbreak,” said Mr Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the former founding executive director of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS. \n Millions of Muslim pilgrims travel each year from around the region to visit Shiite holy sites in Iran and Iraq. In January alone, 30,000 people returned to Afghanistan from Iran, and hundreds of others continue to make the pilgrimage to Qom, the site of the outbreak, every week, Afghan officials say. \n Iraq closed its border with Iran on Saturday (Feb 22), but millions cross it every year. So scores of infected people could potentially have brought the virus to Iraq, depending on how long it has been present in Iran. And as of midday Monday in Najaf, flights to and from Iran were still taking off and landing. \n Governors of Iraqi provinces bordering Iran were taking the potential for contagion seriously and at least two were personally inspecting the border crossings to ensure that they were being policed and that Iranians were barred from crossing into Iraq. \n Mr Qutaybah al-Jubouri, the head of the Iraqi Parliament’s Health Affairs Committee, called the coronavirus “a plague” and said his committee was demanding a far more complete closure of all “land, sea and air” borders with Iran “until the disease is completely controlled.” \n Iran’s health ministry sent a letter to the governor of Qom on Thursday and asked Shiite religious leaders to limit the number of pilgrims at the Shrine to Fatima Masumeh and other religious sites in the city, but as of early Tuesday, throngs of people still gathered around the shrine, touching it and taking part in communal prayers. \n Iran is in many ways a case study in the risks of the disease spreading. The country reported its first case of the coronavirus less than a week ago, in Qom. On Monday health officials reported that four people had died there in the last day, bringing the total to 12. At least 61 others had been infected in Iran, the officials said, with new cases being reported in Isfahan, Hamedan and other cities, as well as in Qom. \n Now the slow drip of news about the spread of the virus is compounding Tehran’s already acute credibility problems, less than two months after officials were forced to admit lying about their knowledge of the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet by air defense systems. Many Iranians on Monday were openly skeptical about the official accounts of the spread of the virus. \n A member of Parliament representing Qom claimed on Monday that at least 50 people had already died there, including 34 in quarantine, and that the first case had been reported more than two weeks before officials acknowledged any infections. \n “Every day 10 people are dying in Qom,” the lawmaker, Mr Ahmad Amiri Farahani, asserted in a speech to Parliament, demanding a quarantine on his city. \n Health Ministry officials vehemently disputed his claims. “I will resign if the numbers are even half or a quarter of this,” said Mr Ahmad Harirchi, adviser to the health minister. \n Adding to the public anxiety, the Iranian news media reported that Dr Mohamad Reza Ghadir, the head of a medical university in Qom and the top official in charge of managing the outbreak there, was among those placed in quarantine. \n On Monday, Dr Ghadir said on Iran’s state television network that the Health Ministry had ordered city officials “not to publish any statistics” related to the outbreak in Qom. The situation there was “very dire and disease has spread across the city, ” he said. \n Iranians, distrusting the authorities, were ignoring official urgings to stay away from hospitals for fear of spreading the disease, instead crowding into emergency rooms to be tested. Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran put up a triage tent outside to handle the overflow. \n In an interview with BBC Persian from Tehran, Dr Babak Gharaye Moghadam urged citizens to “please, please listen” to the advice of health officials and not to turn to social media feeds on their cellphones for guidance. \n The price of hospital masks was spiking across the region, including in Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Afghanistan, where some were selling for as much as 30 times the usual cost. \n Experts worry that few Middle Eastern countries are ready to respond effectively to the threat posed by the virus. \n “How ready are these countries?” asked Dr Montaser Bilbisi, an American-trained infectious disease specialist practicing in Amman, Jordan. “In all honesty, I have not seen the level of readiness that I have seen in China or elsewhere, and even some of the personal protective equipment is lacking.” \n In Jordan, for example, he said that he had not yet seen a fully protective hazardous materials suit. “So health care workers would be at very high risk for infection.” \n In Afghanistan, officials said the first confirmed case of the virus was a 35-year old man from the western province of Herat who had recently traveled to Qom. \n Health officials declared a state of emergency in Herat. The government on Sunday had already suspended all air and ground travel to and from Iran. \n But the border is difficult to seal. Thousands cross every week for religious pilgrimages, trade, jobs and study — about 30,000 in January alone, the International Organization of Migration, an intergovernmental agency, reported. \n “In the past two weeks, more than 1,000 people have visited or traveled to Qom from Herat, which means they come into closer contact with the virus,” the Afghan health minister, Mr Ferozuddin Feroz, said Monday at a news conference in Kabul. \n As officials offered reassurances that they were ordering more hospital masks, residents were panicking about what other precautions to take. \n The son of a professor at a university in Herat, who returned three days ago from Iran, called a reporter for The New York Times on Monday asking what the procedure for quarantine was. \n “My father doesn’t show any signs of corona, but he and our family are worried,” the son, Mr Mohamad Iman, said. “He’s locked himself up in a room where he just reads books. He has asked us to leave him some food and water at the door, but to stay away.” \n Saudi Arabia was the epicenter of a similar outbreak seven years ago, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, that was transmitted from camels to humans. \n But even after seven years, Saudi Arabia, one of the richest countries in the world, has struggled to adapt state-of-the-art hygiene procedures to limit the spread of the virus within hospitals. A Mers outbreak last spring infected at least 61 people, killing eight of them. \n “Many hospitals in Saudi Arabia have improved but some could still do better at prevention,” said Dr David L. Heymann, former chairman of Britain’s Health Protection Agency. \n In Iraq, the country with the most extensive border with Iran, only one case has been detected so far: that of a 22-year old Iranian religious student in Najaf, Mr Suhail Mohammad Ali. \n In the first comprehensive steps to combat the spread of the virus, the education department in Najaf on Monday postponed spring exams and the sacred Imam Ali Shrine was closed. \n The central government’s Health Department recommended avoiding crowded places, kissing or shaking hands. \n In Lebanon, a 41-year-old woman who had traveled to Qom on a religious pilgrimage landed in Beirut on Thursday night and was found Friday to have the virus. It was not until Monday, though, that the government issued an emergency plan, suggesting that travel to the affected areas be restricted and that arriving passengers be isolated at the airport if they showed symptoms. \n But no definite restrictions were ordered; not all passengers landing in Beirut in recent days have been screened; and another two planes from Qom were allowed to land in Beirut on Monday. Passengers on the plane carrying the infected Lebanese woman from Qom were told to quarantine themselves at home. \n The country’s health minister, Dr Hamad Hasan, on Monday urged the Lebanese to stay calm. But Mr Rabih Shaer, founder of a Lebanese nonprofit that campaigns against corruption, called the government’s sluggish response “irresponsible and criminal.” \n “Already the Lebanese population lost trust that this political class can face all the problems,” he said. “And now, until today, they still haven’t taken the right measures. There’s no transparency, there’s no accountability.” \n Dr Nada Melhem, a virologist at the American University of Beirut who has been consulting with the Health Ministry, acknowledged that, “the level of panic in Lebanon is really high.” \n “But with systematic follow-up, we will be able to contain it,” she added. “Are we going to have some gaps?

        "news_content_translate_cn": "纽约——宗教朝圣者、移民工人、商人、士兵和神职人员都不断地在伊朗边境流动，他们经常进入边境管制很少、政府软弱无能、卫生系统脆弱的国家。\n现在，伊朗正在努力控制Covid-19冠状病毒的传播，它也正在成为继中国之后该病毒传播的第二个焦点。伊拉克、阿富汗、巴林、科威特、阿曼、黎巴嫩、阿拉伯联合酋长国——甚至加拿大的一个——的案件都被追踪到伊朗，从喀布尔到贝鲁特，恐惧的震感荡漾开来。\n专家说，中东在很多方面都是引发流行病的最佳场所，穆斯林朝圣者和可能携带病毒的流动工人都在不断地流动。伊朗经济被制裁扼杀，人民对政府失去信任，伊朗领导人与世界许多地区隔绝，对疫情的严重程度几乎没有明确的说法。\n内战或数年的动乱已经摧毁了几个邻国的卫生系统，如叙利亚、伊拉克、阿富汗和也门。该地区大部分地区主要由独裁统治，在提供公共透明度、问责制和卫生服务方面的记录不佳。\n伦敦卫生和热带医学院院长、联合国艾滋病毒/艾滋病联合规划署前创始执行主任彼得·皮奥特说：“这是大规模病毒爆发的处方。”。\n每年有数百万穆斯林朝圣者从该地区各地前往伊朗和伊拉克的什叶派圣地。阿富汗官员说，仅今年1月，就有3万人从伊朗返回阿富汗，还有数百人每周继续前往疫情发生地库姆朝圣。\n伊拉克周六（2月22日）关闭了与伊朗的边境，但每年都有数百万人越过边境. 因此，数十名感染者可能已经将病毒带到伊拉克，这取决于病毒在伊朗存在的时间。截至周一中午，纳杰夫往返伊朗的航班仍在起降。\n与伊朗接壤的伊拉克各省省长正在认真对待传染的可能性，至少有两名省长亲自视察过境点，以确保过境点受到警察的管制，并禁止伊朗人进入伊拉克。\n伊拉克议会卫生事务委员会主席库塔巴朱博里称冠状病毒为“瘟疫”，并说他的委员会要求彻底关闭与伊朗的所有“陆海空”边界，“直到疾病得到完全控制”\n伊朗卫生部周四致函库姆省省长，要求什叶派宗教领袖限制法蒂玛·马苏梅（Fatima Masumeh）和该市其他宗教场所的朝圣者人数，但截至周二早些时候，仍有成群的人聚集在圣殿周围，触摸圣殿并参加社区祈祷。\n伊朗在许多方面是一个疾病传播风险的案例研究。该国不到一周前在库姆报告了第一例冠状病毒病例。星期一，卫生官员报告说，在最后一天，那里有4人死亡，总数达到12人。这些官员说，伊朗至少有61人感染了病毒，伊斯法罕、哈梅丹和其他城市以及库姆都报告了新病例。\n现在，有关病毒传播的缓慢消息使德黑兰本已严重的信誉问题雪上加霜，不到两个月前，政府官员被迫承认，他们知道一架乌克兰客机被防空系统意外击落的消息时撒了谎。星期一，许多伊朗人公开怀疑官方对病毒传播的说法.\n一名代表库姆的国会议员周一声称，至少50人已经在那里死亡，其中包括34人被隔离，第一例病例在官员承认任何感染前两周多已经报告。\n“库姆每天都有10人死亡，”立法者艾哈迈德·阿米里·法拉哈尼在一次议会演讲中宣称，他要求隔离库姆。\n卫生部官员强烈反对他的说法。卫生部长顾问艾哈迈德·哈里奇先生说：“如果人数达到一半或四分之一，我将辞职。”。\n更让公众焦虑的是，伊朗新闻媒体报道说，库姆一所医科大学的校长、负责管理疫情的最高官员穆罕默德·雷扎·加迪尔博士也被隔离。\n周一，加迪尔博士在伊朗国家电视网上说，卫生部已经下令城市官员“不要公布任何与库姆疫情有关的统计数字”。他说，那里的情况“非常可怕，疾病已经蔓延到整个城市”。\n伊朗人不信任当局，他们无视官方要求远离医院的呼吁，害怕疾病传播，而是挤进急诊室接受检查。德黑兰的阿訇霍梅尼医院在外面搭建了一个分流帐篷来处理溢出的情况。\n在接受来自德黑兰的BBC波斯语采访时，Babak Gharaye Moghadam博士敦促市民“请，请倾听”卫生官员的建议，不要求助于手机上的社交媒体来获得指导。\n包括伊朗、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和阿富汗在内的整个地区，医院口罩的价格都在飙升，其中一些口罩的售价高达通常价格的30倍。\n专家们担心，很少有中东国家准备好有效应对病毒带来的威胁.\n“这些国家准备得如何？在约旦安曼执业的美国训练有素的传染病专家Montaser Bilbisi博士问道。“老实说，我没有看到在中国或其他地方看到的准备程度，甚至连一些个人防护装备也缺乏。”\n例如，在约旦，他说他还没有看到一套完全防护的危险品防护服。“所以医护人员感染的风险会非常高。”\n在阿富汗，官员说，第一个确认的病毒病例是一名来自西部赫拉特省的35岁男子，他最近前往库姆。\n卫生官员宣布赫拉特进入紧急状态。政府周日已经暂停了所有来往伊朗的空中和地面旅行。\n但边境很难封锁。据政府间机构国际移民组织（internationalforganizationofmigration）报道，每周有数千人为了宗教朝圣、贸易、工作和学习而过境，仅1月份就有约3万人。\n阿富汗卫生部长费罗祖丁·费罗兹星期一在喀布尔举行的新闻发布会上说：“在过去两周里，有1000多人从赫拉特访问或前往库姆，这意味着他们与病毒有了更密切的接触。”。\n当官员们保证说他们正在订购更多的医院口罩时，居民们对采取其他预防措施感到恐慌。\n赫拉特一所大学教授的儿子三天前从伊朗回来，他周一给《纽约时报》记者打电话询问检疫程序是什么。\n儿子穆罕默德·伊曼说：“我父亲没有任何科罗纳的迹象，但他和我们全家都很担心。”。“他把自己锁在一个只看书的房间里。他让我们在门口给他留些食物和水，但要我们走开.”\n七年前，沙特阿拉伯也曾发生过类似的疫情，称为中东呼吸综合征（MERS），由骆驼传染给人类。\n但是，即使在七年之后，沙特阿拉伯，世界上最富裕的国家之一，一直在努力适应最先进的卫生程序，以限制病毒在医院内的传播。去年春天爆发的Mers感染了至少61人，其中8人死亡。\n英国健康保护局前主席大卫·L·海曼博士说：“沙特阿拉伯的许多医院都有所改善，但有些医院在预防方面仍能做得更好。”。\n在伊拉克，这个与伊朗边界最为广泛的国家，迄今为止只发现了一起案件：纳杰夫一名22岁的伊朗宗教学生苏哈伊尔·穆罕默德·阿里。\n在抗击病毒传播的第一个综合措施中，纳杰夫的教育部门周一推迟了春季考试，神圣的伊玛目阿里神社也关闭了。\n中央政府卫生部门建议避免拥挤的地方，亲吻或握手。\n在黎巴嫩，一名41岁的妇女星期四晚上前往库姆进行宗教朝圣，在贝鲁特着陆，星期五被发现携带病毒。不过，直到周一，政府才发布紧急预案，建议限制前往灾区的旅行，如果抵达的乘客出现症状，应在机场隔离。\n但没有下令实施明确的限制措施；并没有对最近几天在贝鲁特降落的所有乘客进行检查；另外两架来自库姆的飞机周一获准在贝鲁特降落。载有从库姆来的受感染黎巴嫩妇女的飞机上的乘客被告知在家隔离自己。\n黎巴嫩卫生部长哈马德哈桑星期一敦促黎巴嫩人保持冷静. 但黎巴嫩一家反腐败非营利组织的创始人拉比·沙尔称，政府反应迟缓是“不负责任和犯罪行为”\n他说：“黎巴嫩民众已经失去了对这个政治阶层能够面对所有问题的信任。”。“现在，直到今天，他们仍然没有采取正确的措施。没有透明度，没有责任。”\n贝鲁特美国大学（American University of Beirut）的病毒学家纳达·梅勒姆（Nada Melhem）博士一直在咨询卫生部，他承认，“黎巴嫩的恐慌程度确实很高。”\n她补充说：“但有了系统的后续行动，我们将能够遏制住它。”。“我们会有差距吗？我们肯定会有一些，但我希望我们能尽可能地限制它们。《纽约时报》",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Amid expectations of a substantial package to help Singapore cope with the Covid-19 outbreak, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat unveiled during this year’s Budget statement not one, but two special packages totalling S$5.6 billion to help firms and workers, as well as households. \n The packages dwarf the S$230 million package introduced during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003, and significantly exceed analysts’ expectations. \n They comprise a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package which will “stabilise the economy and support our workers and enterprises”, as Mr Heng put it, and a S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package to help households with cost of living. \n The special packages come on the back of lacklustre economic growth last year — 0.7 per cent, the weakest since the 2008 global financial crisis. \n On Monday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its economic growth forecast to between -0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent, down from 0.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent. \n In his Budget speech on Tuesday (Feb 18), Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, noted that Covid-19 hit Singapore “just as the global economy was beginning to recover”. \n “The outbreak will certainly impact our economy,” said Mr Heng, adding that this is especially so since Singapore’s economy is now much more integrated with the economy of China, where the virus originated.  \n The Government is monitoring the situation and it is ready to do more if necessary to help Singaporeans cope with the economic impact, Mr Heng reiterated.  \n Comprising broad-based measures, the two packages will also feature targeted support, with the less well-off and industries more impacted by the outbreak getting more help. \n   \n  \n BROAD-BASED HELP FOR FIRMS, WORKERS  \n JOBS SUPPORT SCHEME  \n Under the Stabilisation and Support Package, a S$1.3 billion Jobs Support Scheme will be rolled out to benefit all enterprises and their local employees which total more than 1.9 million people. The Government will pay for 8 per cent of the wages of these workers, up to a monthly cap of S$3,600 for three months, said Mr Heng. \n This scheme will help businesses retain Singapore workers and will be given to employers by the end of July. The measures are directed toward Singaporean citizens and permanent residents, as well as both full-time and part-time hires. \n ENHANCED WAGE CREDIT SCHEME \n The Wage Credit Scheme currently co-funds wage increases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to S$4,000. \n The cap will be raised to S$5,000 for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020. The Government will also co-fund five percentage points more, raising the levels to 20 per cent for wage raises in 2019 and 15 per cent for those in 2020. \n The enhancement will cost the Government another S$1.1 billion, benefitting 90,000 enterprises and more than 700,000 Singaporean employees, Mr Heng said. \n OTHER INITIATIVES  \n A corporate income tax rebate at the rate of 25 per cent of tax payable, capped at S$15,000 per firm, will also help all tax-paying companies in Singapore. This will cost the Government S$400 million. \n “We will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed properties,” said Mr Heng. \n Tenants and lessees under the JTC Corporation, the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Singapore Land Authority, the Singapore Tourism Board and the Sentosa Development Corporation will receive help with rent, including more flexible rental payments. \n Firms can apply to the relevant agencies which will assess each request individually. \n Several tax treatments under the corporate tax system will also be enhanced for one year, such as allowing a faster write-down of investments in plant and machinery, renovation, and refurbishment under the 2021 year of assessment. \n “This will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises. For example, hotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work, and be better prepared for the rebound,” said Mr Heng. \n To help enterprises access working capital more easily, the working capital loan component under the Enterprise Financing Scheme will be boosted for one year, with the maximum loan quantum doubled to S$600,000. \n The Government will also bear greater risks for these loans, with its share of risk upped to 80 per cent from the current range of 50 to 70 per cent. \n “With the large part of the risk taken up by the Government, I trust that our financial institutions will do their part to support our viable SMEs (small- and medium-sized enterprises),” said Mr Heng. \n TARGETED HELP FOR SECTORS DIRECTLY HIT BY OUTBREAK  \n Additional help will be given to sectors directly affected by the outbreak — tourism, aviation, food services and retail, as well as point-to-point transport sectors. \n These sectors will be given help to retain and reskill workers. The funding period for reskilling workers through redeployment programmes under the Manpower Ministry’s Adapt and Grow initiative will be increased to a maximum of six months. \n Said Mr Heng: “Together with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers in these sectors to retain and train more than 330,000 local workers. These workers can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling to prepare for the recovery.” \n For the tourism sector, a property tax rebate of 30 per cent will be granted this year to accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, as well as venues for Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions). \n International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15 per cent property tax rebate, while integrated resorts will get a 10 per cent tax rebate. \n A temporary bridging loan programme for the tourism sector will also be rolled out for a year, with a loan quantum of up to S$1 million and interest rates capped at 5 per cent. The Government will also bear 80 per cent of the risk of the loan. \n The aviation sector will benefit from a range of measures, including a 15 per cent property tax rebate for Changi Airport, as well as rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance for ground handling agents and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport. \n A Transport Ministry spokesperson said that the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on Singapore’s aviation industry has been significant, with more than 80 per cent of all scheduled flights between Singapore and mainland China cancelled. \n “There are now fewer than 80 services per week, compared with over 400 prior to the outbreak. Passenger traffic has dropped,” said the spokesperson, who added that traffic to Singapore from other regions has also started to decline. \n Food services and retail businesses will also receive rental waivers or rebates. Tenants at National Environment Agency-managed hawker centres and markets will get a full-month of rent waived, and other Government agencies such as HDB will provide a half-month rent waiver to their commercial tenants. \n Those that operate out of private properties will also not be left out — landlords will be granted a 15 per cent property tax rebate for commercial properties that qualify. \n “I strongly urge landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals,” Mr Heng said. \n For the point-to-point transport sector, which include taxi operators and private hire car firms, Mr Heng noted that the Transport Ministry had recently announced a support package for these businesses. Many firms in this sector have come forward to support the initiative by matching the Government’s contribution, he added. \n Said Mr Heng: “This spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.” \n More details of the various measures will be revealed in the upcoming debates into the respective ministries’ budgets. \n Mr Heng added that he will elaborate on the S$1.6 billion Care and Support Package in the later part of his speech. \n S$800M BOOST FOR FRONTLINE AGENCIES \n Separately, apart from the two special packages, another S$800 million will be injected to support the frontline agencies dealing with the outbreak. The bulk of the amount will be channelled to the Ministry of Health. \n “This is on top of the substantial resources already committed each year to public health,” said Mr Heng, who then thanked all frontline officers who have been working tirelessly to fight against the outbreak — prompting other members of the House to thump their armrests in support.  \n Paying tribute to the group, he said: “You exemplify the resilience and indomitable spirit of our people. But please take care of yourselves. I am confident that together, we will stay strong and get through these trying times.” \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "GENEVA (Switzerland) — The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday (Feb 17) warned against \"blanket measures\" over the novel coronavirus outbreak, pointing out the epidemic outside of China was only affecting a \"tiny\" proportion of the population. \n WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva that more than 80 per cent of patients infected with the virus have mild disease and recover, while 14 per cent have severe diseases such as pneumonia. \n WHO also said that — with a mortality rate of around 2 percent — Covid-19 was \"less deadly\" than other coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). \n WHO officials rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted to avoid risking a new nest of infection like the one on the coronavirus-hit Diamond Princess off Japan. \n \"Measures should be taken proportional to the situation. Blanket measures may not help,\" Mr Tedros said. \n The outbreak, which has infected some 70,500 people in China and killed over 1,700, has battered manufacturing and tourism across the region and led to multiple travel restrictions including for flights and cruises. \n \"If we are going to disrupt every cruise ship in the world on the off chance that there might be some potential contact with some potential pathogen then where do we stop?\" said Mr Michael Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies programme. \n Mr Ryan said that even at the epicentre of the crisis in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei Province, the \"attack rate\" — a measure of the speed of spread of the virus — was four per 100,000. \n \"This is a very serious outbreak and it has the potential to grow, but we need to balance that in terms of the number of people infected. Outside Hubei this epidemic is affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people,\" he said. \n Mr Tedros also referred to an apparent decline in new cases of the disease in recent days but said that the trend \"must be interpreted very cautiously\". \n \"Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,\" he said. \n Around five percent of cases are considered critical with possible multi-organ failure, septic shock and respiratory failure and, in some cases, death,\" he added. \n Mr Tedros said there were \"relatively few cases\" among children and more research was needed to understand why.

        "news_content_translate_en": "HUBEI — These days, Ms Chloe Chang, a Taiwanese woman stranded at the centre of China’s coronavirus outbreak, says she wakes up every half-hour during the night. Sometimes she breaks down in tears. \n She and her family are effectively trapped in her grandmother’s apartment building, where a man recently died from the virus. Workers in hazmat suits haunt the surrounding streets, and the neighbourhood has a strong police presence. \n There are shortages of food and other essentials throughout Yichang, the Hubei province city of more than 4 million where they have been in limbo for weeks. \n “No household can go out at this time,” said Ms Chang, a 26-year-old industrial artist. She said she feared that even a trip for groceries would increase her chances of contracting the virus. \n “My child has eaten nine meals of plain noodles in the past three days,” she said of her 2-year-old son. \n Ms Chang and her family thought they were on the verge of escaping Yichang earlier this month, but the bus taking them to the airport was abruptly turned around. \n All she can do now is wait — and hope. \n “The government of Taiwan surely will come to our rescue,” her husband, Mr Calvin Fan, who is from Beijing, has reassured her. But the chartered flight they have eagerly awaited to evacuate them has yet to materialise. \n “Neither side wants us,” Chang said. “We’ve given up. Now we are refugees.” \n Taiwan and China each say the other is the reason that she and other Taiwan citizens are unable to leave Hubei, a province under lockdown, where hundreds have died from the coronavirus and tens of thousands have been infected. \n Ms Chang and hundreds of other Taiwanese people in Hubei had hoped to go home via chartered jet. But last month, after the first plane carrying evacuees landed in Taiwan with an infected passenger onboard, a backlash ensued on the self-governing island, which China claims as part of its territory. \n Some said Taiwan would not be able to handle an outbreak if more infected people arrived. Others said Taiwan should not help to evacuate mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan residents. \n Decades of tensions between the two governments have come to a head over the outbreak, and people like Ms Chang and her husband — both of who arrived in China last month to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday with family — have become pawns in a complicated and dangerous game of political chess. \n Ms Chang said she was told by Chinese officials that she could return to Taiwan on a second chartered flight, scheduled for Feb 5. That day, her family boarded a bus bound for the airport in Wuhan, the provincial capital, where the coronavirus first emerged. \n But just as the bus was about to leave, she said, a Chinese official hopped on and announced that the flight would not take off, saying: “Taiwan won’t let you go back.” \n “I was really devastated,” Ms Chang said. \n Taiwan had a different explanation. According to officials there, reports in Chinese state media that said a flight was scheduled to leave were untrue — the two sides had never discussed it. \n Both governments, and their proxies, have continued to point fingers while Ms Chang and her compatriots languish in Hubei. \n “Taiwan authorities have repeatedly delayed the schedule,” Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, said last week. “Let the Taiwan compatriots return home as soon as possible, and stop making up all manner of excuses and rationale to block them from returning.” \n Mr Chen Shih-Chung, Taiwan’s minister of health and welfare, said Friday that “China still uses all excuses to delay the evacuation, and refuses our plans and suggestions.” \n Fears of the virus — and, perhaps, anti-China sentiment — have led Taiwan to escalate preventive measures in recent days. \n On Wednesday, Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre announced that children who have mainland citizenship but a Taiwanese parent would not be allowed to enter Taiwan for the time being if they were arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. \n Confined to her grandmother’s home for so long, Ms Chang has turned to her art as an outlet for the helplessness and resentment she feels. \n In a satirical cartoon she recently sketched, she portrayed the administration of Ms Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, as deliberately delaying the evacuation. \n She depicted the Taiwanese in Hubei as pawns.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — A 50 year old Singaporean male is the second taxi driver known to have become infected with Covid-19 here.  \n He had no recent travel history to China, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a statement on Saturday (Feb 15). \n The Jurong West resident reported an onset of symptoms on Feb 3 and sought treatment at two general practitioner (GP) clinics on four occasions - Feb 5, 7, 10 and 13.  \n On his last visit to a GP he was referred to the emergency department at National University Hospital and is currently warded at an isolation room there. The man, who has been classified as Case 64, tested positive for the virus on Feb 14.  \n He has no links to previous cases. \n MOH said that it is working with the Ministry of Transport to reach out to all taxi and private hire car drivers on the steps they should take to protect themselves in the course of their work. \n It added that for the general public, the risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low. \n The first known case of a taxi driver being infected with the virus was Case 35. The patient was a 64-year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China.  \n He was admitted to Singapore General Hospital on Feb 6. Subsequent test results confirmed the infection on Feb 7 afternoon. Prior to hospital admission, he worked as a taxi driver and had largely stayed at his home at Henderson Crescent after onset of symptoms, except to visit Redhill Market and a hawker centre at Bukit Merah for meals. \n So far, there have also been two known cases of infected private-hire drivers. \n One of them was Case 27 who is the 45-year-old husband of a saleswoman at Yong Thai Hong. The saleswoman was among two staff members of the traditional Chinese medicine shop on Cavan Road off Lavender Street, which was one of the first clusters to emerge. The couple's six-month old son and 44-year-old Indonesian domestic helper were also infected.  \n The second case was Case 37, a 53-year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China. He was admitted to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital on Feb 6, and transferred to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on Feb 8. Subsequent test results confirmed the infection on Feb 7 afternoon. Before he was warded, he worked as a private hire car driver and stays at Jurong East Street 32. \n On Feb 10, the Land Transport Authority said that it would be giving out 300,000 masks to taxi and private-hire drivers. \n Each driver would be given four masks to use or to offer to passengers who are unwell and do not have a mask when getting a ride to seek medical attention. \n As part of precautionary measures, drivers have also been asked to take their temperature twice a day since last week.  \n CORRECTION: An earlier version of the article stated that this was the first known case of a taxi driver infected with Covid-19. This is incorrect. It is the second known case. We are sorry for the error. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (BLOOMBERG) - The coronavirus epidemic is accelerating a shake-out in China's property sector as a cash crunch forces distressed developers to throw in the towel. \n With lockdowns across the world's most-populous nation entering their third month, smaller home builders are being pushed to the brink because they can't get enough money from pre-sales of apartments to cover their costs. \n In the first two months of this year, around 105 real estate firms issued bankruptcy filing statements, after almost 500 collapses in 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \n \"A vast number of mid- to small-sized developers will face a choice no one wants to make - either sell their property assets and start another business, or be bought out,\" China Index Holdings Research Director Huang Yu said. \n \"The shake-out is just beginning.\" \n Even before the new coronavirus, China's housing market was under pressure. \n Home prices rose at the slowest pace in almost two years in January and several developers, saddled with debt they're struggling to service, began to dial back on construction. S&P Global Ratings said in a note on Tuesday (March 10) that as Covid-19 spreads, the squeeze may be felt most acutely by Chinese banks and property firms. \n As a result, mergers and acquisitions among the nation's almost 100,000 real estate companies will ramp up again in 2020, Mr Yu said, declining to put a number on the expected deal value. \n \"Declining sales will hurt developers' liquidity, as the proceeds still form the largest and most important funding source,\" S&P credit analyst Christopher Yip said, noting that with construction largely paused, delivery schedules and revenue recognition are being pushed further out. \n \"Several companies already in the CCC category or with low ratings with negative outlooks may face liquidity issues.\" \n New York-based Avenue Capital Group, a firm that trades distressed debt and invests in special situations, said a China home market in flux spells increasingly versatile buying opportunities. It's looking at scooping up soured developer debt and buying troubled real estate projects at a discount. \n \"There'll be more bargains appearing on the market,\" said Wang Yifeng, Avenue Capital's Shanghai-based head of China. \"If you see a distressed seller among the country's top 100 firms, don't be surprised.\" \n Construction Halted According to S&P, new home sales in China will register their first drop in 12 years this year, with transactions down as much as 15 per cent. That's if the virus reaches a turning point this month. If the nadir isn't until April, sales could be down around 20 per cent, akin to the hit taken during the 2008 global financial crisis. \n Fusheng Group is one of the first mid-sized developers to falter. The debt-laden company, based in China's southeastern Fujian province, was in talks to sell a 70 per cent stake to a consortium led by Shimao Property Holdings, people familiar with the matter said in December. \n Local media reported in January that a new joint venture has been established, with Fusheng injecting its jettisoned property projects into the fresh vehicle. Shimao is one of the nation's biggest developers. \n Representatives from Fusheng didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment. \n Cash flows of less competent players have been sliding for years and the virus is only making matters worse, according to Wu Rui, an executive director of non-performing assets at private equity firm CDH Investments Fund Management Co. Asset-management companies are teaming up with top developers and eyeing such businesses, he said. \n In Hubei alone, the epicentre of the virus, there are around 4,300 developers. Home prices in Hubei's provincial city Wuhan rose at one of the fastest paces in the world last year, Knight Frank data show. \n To the north, in central Henan province, the general manager of one small developer said the only target his company had set, in early February, was to make all of its debt repayments over the next six months. \n Another manager at a small developer based in Zhejiang, a province in China's east, said the firm was two months away from bankruptcy. Its four projects under construction are halted because of the virus, he said. \n \"The epidemic could actually be a fresh opportunity for big developers,\" said Liu Ce, who's in charge of growth strategy at another large homebuilder, Shenzhen-based Kaisa Group Holdings. \n \"We can pull many levers to alleviate cash flow stress. Once you live through that, you see the wave of asset offloading by small players as a good chance.\" \n Kaisa became the first, and only, Chinese developer to default on its US dollar debt in April 2015. It went through a huge debt restructure and spent years rebuilding its balance sheet and credit rating. \n Now, it's regained investor confidence; Kaisa has already sold US$1.2 billion (S$1.67 billion) of bonds this year and in January, bought a site in Hong Kong's New Territories for HK$3.5 billion (S$630 million) to expand its foothold in the city. \n But while the likes of Kaisa, Shimao and China Evergrande Group have hundreds of property projects nationwide, the majority of China's developers are small and unlisted, with sometimes just a handful of projects in one city. They're the ones most at risk from the twin forces of coronavirus and a slowing market. \n Smaller developers also typically do not rely on bank loans or bond sales to alleviate funding concerns. Instead, they count on inflows from apartment sales, as well as shadow financing. \n Policymakers have so far refrained from unleashing wholesale monetary stimulus measures for real estate firms, fearing that could result in a surge in home prices. Most support has come from marginal easing by local governments. The central bank reiterated earlier this month that real estate \"definitely\" won't be used to stimulate the economy. \n Shenzhen on Wednesday allowed builders to draw on some cash deposits, which are usually held in reserve by banks during construction to ensure developers don't abandon projects. Still, local officials stressed the current home-buying restrictions won't be loosened. \n Coronavirus may be the \"straw that broke the camel's back for many small builders\", said Xie Yangchun, an analyst at China Real Estate Information Corp. \n \"A new wave of industry consolidation has started.\" \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "上海（彭博社）-冠状病毒的流行正在加速中国房地产行业的洗牌，因为资金短缺迫使陷入困境的开发商认输。\n随着全球人口最多的国家进入第三个月的停工期，小型房屋建筑商正被推到悬崖边上，因为他们无法从预售公寓中获得足够的资金来支付成本。\n彭博社（Bloomberg）汇编的数据显示，在2019年近500家房地产公司倒闭后，今年前两个月，约105家房地产公司发布了破产申请声明。\n中国指数控股研究总监黄宇表示：“大量中小型开发商将面临一个谁也不想做的选择——要么出售房产资产另起炉灶，要么被收购。”。\n“摇号才刚刚开始。”\n甚至在新冠状病毒爆发之前，中国房地产市场就面临着压力。\n今年1月，房价以近两年来最慢的速度上涨，几家开发商背负着难以偿还的债务，开始收回建设资金。标普全球评级公司（S&P Global Ratings）周二（3月10日）在一份报告中表示，随着Covid-19的利差扩大，中国银行和房地产公司可能最为强烈地感受到压力。\n俞正声表示，因此，到2020年，中国近10万家房地产企业的并购活动将再度升温，但他拒绝透露预期交易价值的数字。\n标普信贷分析师克里斯托弗•叶（Christopher Yip）表示：“销售下滑将损害开发商的流动性，因为收益仍是最大、最重要的资金来源，”他指出，随着建筑业基本停建，交付进度和收入确认正进一步推后。\n“一些已经进入CCC类别或评级较低、前景为负面的公司可能面临流动性问题.\"\n总部位于纽约的Avenue Capital Group是一家从事不良债务交易并在特殊情况下投资的公司，该公司表示，中国房地产市场的动荡意味着越来越多的购买机会。它正在寻找挖走恶化的开发商债务，以折扣价购买陷入困境的房地产项目。\nAvenue Capital驻上海的中国区负责人王逸峰（音）说：“市场上会出现更多的便宜货。”如果你看到一家陷入困境的卖家跻身全美100强，不要惊讶。”\n根据标准普尔（S&P）的数据，中国的新建住房销售今年将出现12年来的首次下降，交易额跌幅将高达15%。如果病毒在这个月达到一个转折点。如果最低点要到4月份，销售额可能会下降20%左右，类似于2008年全球金融危机期间遭受的打击。\n富盛集团是首批摇摇欲坠的中型开发商之一。知情人士去年12月表示，这家负债累累的公司总部位于中国东南部的福建省，正与世茂地产控股（Shimao Property Holdings）牵头的财团进行谈判，希望将70%的股权出售给该财团。\n当地媒体今年1月报道称，新的合资公司已经成立，富盛将其被放弃的地产项目注入新的汽车。世茂是中国最大的开发商之一。\n福生的代表没有立即回复寻求置评的消息。\n私募股权投资公司CDH投资基金管理公司（CDH Investments Fund Management Co.）不良资产执行董事吴锐（Wu Rui）表示，能力较弱的公司的现金流多年来一直在下滑，病毒只会让情况变得更糟。资产管理公司正与顶级开发商合作，并瞄准此类业务。\n仅在病毒的震中湖北，就有大约4300名开发者。莱坊数据显示，湖北省会城市武汉去年房价涨幅居世界前列.\n在河南省中部的北部，一家小型开发商的总经理说，公司在2月初制定的唯一目标是在未来6个月内偿还所有债务。\n位于中国东部浙江省的一家小型开发商的另一位经理表示，该公司距离破产还有两个月的时间。他说，该公司正在建设的四个项目因病毒而暂停。\n另一家大型住宅建筑商、深圳凯萨集团控股公司（Kaisa Group Holdings）负责增长战略的刘策表示：“这种流行病实际上可能是大型开发商的一个新机会。”。\n“我们可以动用许多杠杆来缓解现金流压力。一旦你度过了这一关，你就会发现，小玩家抛售资产的浪潮是一个很好的机会。”\n2015年4月，凯萨成为第一家也是唯一一家拖欠美元债务的中国开发商。它经历了一次巨大的债务重组，并花了数年时间重建其资产负债表和信用评级。\n现在，它恢复了投资者的信心；KaISA已经在今年和一月卖出了12亿美元（16亿7000万美元）的债券，在香港新界购买了一个35亿港元（约合6亿3000万美元）的网站，以扩大其在城市的立足点。\n不过，尽管凯萨、世茂和恒大集团等公司在全国拥有数百个地产项目，但中国的开发商大多规模较小，没有上市，有时一个城市只有少数项目。它们是受冠状病毒和市场放缓双重影响风险最大的病毒。\n小型开发商通常也不依赖银行贷款或债券销售来缓解资金问题。相反，他们依赖公寓销售的资金流入，以及影子融资。\n到目前为止，政策制定者们还没有对房地产公司采取大规模的货币刺激措施，担心这可能导致房价飙升。多数支持来自地方政府的边际宽松政策. 中国央行本月早些时候重申，房地产“肯定”不会用于刺激经济。\n深圳周三允许建筑商提取部分现金存款，这些存款通常由银行在施工期间储备，以确保开发商不会放弃项目。不过，当地官员强调，目前的住房限购政策不会放松。\n中国房地产信息集团公司（chinarealestateinformationcorp.）分析师谢阳春表示，冠状病毒可能是“许多小型建筑商折断骆驼背的稻草”。\n“新一轮行业整合浪潮已经开始。”",

It is necessary to give first priority to this.” \n Mr Xi had been expected to make the state visit in the spring after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe formally invited him during last year’s Group of 20 summit in Osaka. The last state visit by a Chinese president to Japan was in 2008, and Mr Xi’s trip was cast as a key sign of warming bilateral ties. \n The coronavirus outbreak, however, has delayed the visit. \n “China and Japan are both currently fully fighting the NCP (novel coronavirus pneumonia) epidemic,” Mr Zhao Lijian, foreign ministry spokesman, told a news conference in Beijing. “Both sides agreed on the necessity of ensuring that Chairman Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan takes place at the most appropriate timing, environment and atmosphere, and achieves full success.” \n Japanese officials had in recent weeks insisted that the trip was on despite the spread of the virus. \n “A visit to Japan by a Chinese president is once-in-a-decade event,” Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said last week. “It is important that we will make sure that it will be something that will result in full achievements,” he added, in comments seen at the time as suggesting the trip could be delayed. \n The virus has infected more than 95,000 people worldwide and killed over 3,200.  \n The postponement came as Japan steps up its response to the epidemic, which has infected at least 317 people and been linked to six deaths domestically. Tokyo has faced criticism for acting slowly when the outbreak began and for its handling of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where more than 700 people contracted the virus. \n On Thursday, the Yomiuri daily reported that Japan will quarantine all arrivals from China and South Korea for two weeks, without specifying when the measures were expected to take effect. In an exclusive, the paper said Chinese and Korean tourists would be asked not to visit Japan, and visas would be suspended. The Yomiuri said the measures would be announced by Mr Abe later on Thursday. \n Relations between Asia’s two biggest economies have warmed in recent years after suffering in 2012 when Tokyo “nationalised” disputed islands claimed by Beijing. \n Mr Abe visited Beijing in 2018 – the first official visit by a Japanese prime minister since 2011. He also visited China last December to hold talks with South Korea’s Mr Moon Jae-in and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang at a trilateral summit. During his stay in China, Mr Abe separately met Mr Xi. \n Last June, Mr Abe met Mr Xi on the sidelines of the G-20 summit and invited him for a state visit. “I want to enhance Japan-China relations... by welcoming President Xi Jinping to Japan during cherry blossom next year,” Mr Abe said at the time. \n The world’s second- and third-largest economies have a fraught relationship, complicated by longstanding maritime disputes and Japan’s wartime legacy. The thaw has accelerated in recent months as both countries face trade battles with United States President Donald Trump. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - The drug touted by United States President Donald Trump as a possible line of treatment against the coronavirus comes with severe warnings in China and can kill in dosages as small as 2g. \n China, where the deadly pathogen first emerged in December, recommended the decades-old malaria drug chloroquine to treat infected patients in guidelines issued in February after seeing encouraging results in clinical trials. But within days, it cautioned doctors and health officials about the drug's lethal side effects and rolled back its usage. \n This came after local media reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology study found that the drug can kill an adult dosed at just twice the daily amount recommended for treatment, which is 1g. \n As the drug has not been approved by the US Food And Drug Administration to treat the disease known as Covid-19, the Chinese experience may be useful as the American regulator studies the medication which has been endorsed by Mr Trump as well as Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk. \n The pandemic, which has sickened more than 235,000 globally and killed over 9,800 people, has triggered growing anxiety across the US as states say they lack testing kits and medical equipment. California instituted a statewide lockdown on Thursday (March 19) to slow the outbreak. \n Chloroquine was among the first group of therapies Chinese scientists identified as being effective in curbing the new coronavirus. Clinical trials on about 130 patients demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce the severity of the illness and speed up virus clearance, according to China's Ministry of Sciences and Technology. \n Chloroquine phosphate was officially recommended on Feb 19 in the Covid-19 treatment guidelines published by China's National Health Commission, along with a few other drugs such as AbbVie Inc's Kaletra and flu drug arbidol as antiviral treatments for patients. The commission recommended no more than a 10-day course of chloroquine for adult patients at 500mg - half a gram - twice a day. \n As hundreds of clinical trials are launched to study potential Covid-19 treatments, stocks of drugmakers and biotechnology companies have racked up big gains on the hope that the industry will see a windfall. But the history of previous viral outbreaks like Ebola and Zika show little success in producing viable treatments. Some potential drugs were developed only after the epidemics already waned through containment measures. \n China's recommendation to use chloroquine in treatment was quickly followed by a warning. \n Two days after the treatment guideline update, the health authorities in Hubei province - China's worst-hit region, where the outbreak started and which accounted for the majority of its over 80,000 patients - asked hospitals to closely watch for, and immediately report, any adverse side effects of chloroquine phosphate, according to a report in local media outlet The Paper. \n The drug is known to have short-term side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and tinnitus, while long-term use can irreversibly impair eyesight. It is forbidden for pregnant women, as it can cause congenital defects in babies. \n The China Health Commission revised the dosage in a Feb 29 notice tightening chloroquine use. The drug cannot be given to pregnant women, those with heart disease, terminal liver and renal disease, retina and hearing loss and patients on antibiotics such as azithromycin and steroid. \n It can now be given only to patients between 18 and 65 years of age for a seven-day treatment course. Patients weighing over 50kg can take 500mg twice a day - the usual dose - while those weighing less will be administered the drug just once a day after two days of use, according to the latest guidelines. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China is rushing a flurry of patient studies to identify the most effective life-saving treatments for people sickened by the coronavirus. \n Some 77 clinical trials targeting the pneumonia-causing virus have been registered in China since Jan 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \n The disease, known as Covid-19, has infected at least 48,000 people, killing more than 1,300, mostly in China, since it emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019 and spread to two dozen countries. \n The trials range from the high-profile study of Gilead Sciences Inc's experimental antiviral drug remdesivir and AbbVie Inc's HIV pill Kaletra, to tests of traditional Chinese herbal medicines and whether the sport of shadowboxing may aid recovery. \n While the sheer size of the research effort is noteworthy, the ability to scientifically and methodically discern ways to treat and prevent infections caused by a pathogen in the middle of an outbreak is unprecedented. \n \"The role that research can play is often very contentious, whether we need to respond to an outbreak or whether we can actually take the time to research interventions,\" said Dr Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. \"It's really important for us to be able to do both. \n \"The pace of research can keep up sometimes and really needs to be not an afterthought, because we don't know how long some of these new emerging infections will persist,\" she said, noting that scientific accuracy and research quality remain critical. \n Much of the research effort has been guided by the World Health Organisation's R&D Blueprint that enables the rapid activation of research studies during epidemics. \n Chinese regulators have been streamlining bureaucracies to cut the time it takes to approve drug trials and win approvals, ensuring that patients can get cutting-edge medicines fast and, in some cases, even before patients in developed countries. \n \"Optimistically, some of the trials could have an early readout in three to four weeks,\" said Dr Ding Sheng, dean of Tsinghua University's School of Pharmaceutical Sciences. If trials meet their key objectives, \"conditional approval could be considered, given the current outbreak situation\", he said. \n Some studies, including the one testing remdesivir, require regulatory approval from the National Medical Products Administration, while others are initiated by doctors and can proceed after hospital ethics committees have given their consent. \n It is important to start studies while the virus is circulating widely so researchers can determine relatively quickly which medicines are most effective. \n The large number of patients being diagnosed means that studies may be conducted fast, with full enrollment of antiviral drug trials occurring in just six months, said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the WHO's chief scientist. \n Efforts to develop drugs for Ebola and the coronaviruses that caused Sars and Mers ran into difficulty because of waning cases. Complicating the process is the potential that an outbreak may abate before a vaccine or treatment is ready for use, diminishing its value. \n Gilead's experimental drug remdesivir, which was developed to fight Ebola, but has shown some signs of potency against Sars and Mers, is being tested at a hospital in Wuhan after a coronavirus patient getting it in the US appeared to respond. \n Some 761 patients are expected to be enrolled in the trial, 66 per cent of whom will be dosed with the drug. The remainder will receive standard treatment and placebo, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. \n While the drug's effectiveness against the new coronavirus is still being investigated, scientists in China who tested it in labs filed an application to patent its use against the coronavirus as early as Jan 21. The move was seen as an effort by China to gain some bargaining power as it negotiates licence fees with Gilead in the event that clinical trials prove remdesivir works in patients. \n China's National Health Commission recommends AbbVie's Kaletra be used as part of antiviral treatment for Covid-19 cases even while it plans to study the efficacy of the HIV medicine alongside antivirals such as Roche Holding AG's Xofluza, and Avigan, an anti-influenza medication developed by Fujifilm Holdings Corp and Toyama Chemical Co. \n Traditional Chinese remedies are also being explored for their virus-fighting potential. \n Guangdong Province Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital is conducting observational studies to check the efficacy of two different concoctions of Chinese herbal medicines: one for infected patients and the other for those suspected of having the infection, said Dr Liu Yuntao, who applied to conduct the trials. Further studies may be done if they appear to be effective, she said. \n It's important to ensure clinical studies are of high quality and generate meaningful results, WHO's Dr Swaminathan said. \n \"As long as the studies are done well, well-designed to give the right answer, there may be products which can be tested as adjunct therapies, for example, along with anti-retrovirals,\" she said. \"I would like to see that they're tested in good clinical trial protocols.\" \n Guangdong's drug regulator approved the use of an herbal medicine, dubbed \"Pneumonia Formula 1\", across 30 hospitals. It was designated for treating pneumonia caused by the virus after more than half of the 50 patients who took it said symptoms such as coughing, throat pain and weakness resolved, and all of them no longer had fever, state media reported. \n ",

It is closed on Jan 1, 2020. \n On Jan 9, the WHO says that the outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, which is a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like Sars. \n To date, 59 people have been infected, of whom seven are in a serious condition, according to an official toll. \n The Chinese health authorities say a first person died of the virus on Jan 11. They revise downwards the number of sick people to 41. \n On Jan 13, the virus spreads beyond China's borders for the first time, with a case emerging in Thailand, according to the WHO. The victim is a Chinese woman diagnosed with mild pneumonia who was returning from a trip to Wuhan. \n On Jan 15, China's health commission says no human-to-human transmission of the virus behind the Wuhan outbreak has been confirmed so far, but the possibility \"cannot be excluded\". \n The next day, a first case of the virus is confirmed in Japan in someone who had stayed in Wuhan in early January. \n On Jan 17, a second person, a 69-year-old man, dies in Wuhan, according to the authorities. \n The same day, the CDC announces that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at three airports: San Francisco, New York's JFK and Los Angeles. \n On Jan 20, a third death and more than 100 new cases are announced in China, sparking concerns ahead of the annual Chinese New Year holiday which begins on Jan 25 and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel nationwide. \n The virus is present in Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the east and Shenzhen in the south. More than 200 cases have been recorded. The virus is also detected in South Korea in a Chinese person who arrived by plane from Wuhan. \n China's President Xi Jinping says that the virus must be \"resolutely contained\", in his first public comments on the outbreak. \n Human-to-human transmission is \"affirmative\", a top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan tells state broadcaster CCTV. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "A Viruses are microscopic biological parasites that lack the ability to survive and reproduce outside living organisms, which include animals, humans and even bacteria. \n They become active only when they come into contact with living cells, which they then try to hijack to produce more viruses. \n A They belong to a large group of viruses that usually infect only animals, and are so named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. \n Scientists have identified coronaviruses that affect humans, with seven types of these viruses classified to date. \n Four of these typically cause mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illnesses such as the common cold. But the remaining three have more severe repercussions on human health. \n The first is the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus, which killed almost 800 people in 32 countries 17 years ago. \n The other two are Mers-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and later spread farther, and 2019-nCov (Wuhan virus), which killed its first victims in the Chinese city of Wuhan. \n A Scientists speculate that the Wuhan virus, like the Mers and Sars viruses, evolved from coronavirus strains that previously affected only animals. \n Coronaviruses generally have a single strand of genetic material called RNA, which is more easily copied or mutated than humans' double-stranded DNA, and this accounts for their virality. \n The Wuhan virus has been closely linked to Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, which reportedly also peddled live animals like deer and animal parts, in addition to seafood. \n Scientists said that such unnatural situations, where animals are brought together and often housed in poor conditions in close proximity to people, create opportunities for a virus to hop between animals. The virus could then have mutated so that it is able to infect humans, and eventually start spreading among people. \n Every virus typically infects a certain type of living host organism, said Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, deputy executive director of research at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Bioinformatics Institute. \"Viruses can shift their host preference through mutations... Some viruses mutate much faster.\" \n A The Wuhan coronavirus is understood to spread much like the common flu does - through the air when an infected person coughs, through close contact such as shaking hands with an infected person, or touching an object which has the virus on it before touching one's mouth and eyes. \n For now, virologists say the Wuhan coronavirus is likely not as infectious as the Sars virus. But there are concerns that the Wuhan virus' current reported 2 per cent death rate - where two out of 100 infected people die - is not representative, and that the virus could further mutate to become more lethal. \n There are worries that the number of infections is under-reported, with many brushing off symptoms as those of the common flu. \n A It is a different strain and, for now, has reported a lower fatality rate than the Sars virus. \n The World Health Organisation estimates the overall fatality rate for Sars patients to be between 14 per cent and 15 per cent, while that for Wuhan is currently at 2 per cent. \n Researchers have said that the Wuhan virus shares only 76 per cent of its genetic material with the Sars virus - a big difference in genetic terms, much like \"comparing a dog and a cat\". \n There is, however, speculation that both viruses originated from bats. Recent reports have also suggested that the Wuhan virus might be linked to snakes too. \n A No, said Professor Paul Tambyah of the Department of Medicine at the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. \n Instead, we should be concerned. \n He said there are measures in place to control the outbreak here and elsewhere. The public should be concerned and thus be vigilant about maintaining good hand hygiene, seeking medical attention if unwell and staying home, he said. \n A Wear a surgical mask when you have a cold or flu. \n Some doctors have been wearing surgical masks as a precautionary measure at work, so some people have wondered if they should dig out their N95 masks too. \n But there is no need to, said Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Instead, they should wear surgical ones. \n \"N95 masks are... very difficult to breathe in. If you find the N95 mask easy to breathe in and comfortable, you are wearing it wrongly and it is no use,\" she said, adding that these masks are not recommended for the public. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said everyone with respiratory symptoms must wear masks, now that there is human-to-human transmission for the Wuhan virus. \n A The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday said Singaporeans should avoid travelling to Wuhan, stepping up a notch from its advice on Wednesday for people to defer non-essential travel there. \n The ministry said it updated the travel advisory \"in view of the developing novel coronavirus situation in Wuhan and other parts of China\", with confirmed cases spreading beyond Wuhan to Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong, which abuts densely populated Hong Kong. \n It also cited the travel halt imposed by the Chinese authorities on Thursday, as all flights out of the city were cancelled and trains, buses and ferries suspended. \n The ministry also reminded the public to continue to exercise caution and pay attention to personal hygiene when travelling to the rest of China. \n MOH said all travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history. \n If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose, they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit. \n A Singapore is stepping up precautionary measures in anticipation of more travellers in the lead-up to the Chinese New Year holidays. \n The expanded measures include temperature screening for all travellers arriving from China - not just Wuhan alone - at Changi Airport from yesterday, and issuing health advisory notices to them. \n A A flu vaccine will not help protect you against the Wuhan coronavirus. There is no vaccine to protect against coronaviruses. \n However, according to an advisory from Raffles Medical, you should still get a flu jab if you are travelling to places where there are suspected cases to prevent you from contracting influenza symptoms that may mislead the screening authorities at temperature checkpoints. \n There is also no specific treatment to cure illnesses caused by human coronaviruses, including pneumonia caused by the Wuhan virus. \n Patients typically recover on their own after some time. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(REUTERS) - The effects of the coronavirus outbreak are likely to reverberate beyond China as most major economies in the region are expected to either slow down significantly, halt or shrink outright in the current quarter, Reuters polls of economists found. \n Singapore is forecast to be the worst affected from the fallout, with growth dropping by more than 1 percentage point for 2020. The least impact would be on Indonesia, which is expected to grow 4.7 per cent this year. \n A port city and a major trade partner with China, Singapore is expected to contract 0.6 per cent in the January to March quarter of this year, a first since the 2009 recession after the global financial crisis. \n Many Asian economies, which were just limping back to growth from the spillover effects of the 18-month United States-China trade dispute, were again dealt a blow by the outbreak, which has shut down businesses and cities. \n With the Covid-19 contagion interrupting global supply chains that most countries depend on for trade and commerce, economic activity is likely to slow, but at varying degrees. \n Forecasts from economists collected from Feb 19 to 25 showed that Singapore, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand are all expected to put in their worst performance in years in the first quarter. Only Indonesia is expected to remain relatively unscathed. \n \"The impact of the coronavirus on economies in Asia is potentially huge, as tourism in the region takes a beating. From deserted hotels to empty airports, the impact of this little scrap of protein and lipid on economies in the region is potentially enormous,\" said Mr Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research for Asia-Pacific at ING in Singapore. \n \"If this doesn't sound sufficiently scary, bear in mind that tourism is just one of the channels through which the coronavirus can weaken the GDP growth of Asian countries grappling with this epidemic.\" \n A similar Reuters poll published a little over a week ago found that the Chinese economy will grow at its slowest pace in the current quarter since the financial crisis, with a worst-case scenario showing it at 3.5 per cent, nearly half of the 6 per cent reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. \n \"The base case is rapidly shifting from 'Bad', meaning only China is impacted, to 'Ugly', where both emerging Asia and developed economies see soaring infection rates and deaths,\" said Mr Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Asia-Pacific at Rabobank in Hong Kong. \n \"Its effects will likely resemble the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 more than the Sars outbreak in 2003,\" he said, referring to the economic impact. \n That fear in financial markets was clear on Monday, when world stocks took a nosedive to a two-year low as a surge in virus infections outside mainland China fuelled fears of a global pandemic. \n Proximity to the region's economic powerhouse and trade relations mean any impact from a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy is likely to be felt across the region. \n While a bounce back in the next quarter is expected for most major Asian economies polled, growth for this year is likely to be lower than predicted just last month, suggesting some activity would be permanently lost. \n More than three-quarters of economists, 57 of 77, who answered an additional question also expect growth across these other Asian economies to pick up in the second quarter. \n While South Korea was the hardest hit by the virus outside China, its impact on the economy so far seems modest, according to forecasters who expect it to grow 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, down only 0.4 percentage point from a January Reuters poll. \n Thailand's and Taiwan's economies are forecast to expand at a paltry 0.2 per cent and 1.3 per cent in the current quarter, the lowest in nearly half a decade. \n Australia's economy, a proxy for Chinese economic growth, is forecast to grind to a halt in the current quarter, ending the country's near three-decade growth streak that started in 1991. \n \"This (the virus outbreak) can be hurtful to growth in several countries beyond just the negative spillovers from China. A sharp rise in infections reported by several countries raises concerns of a deeper hit to these countries and also global growth,\" said Ms Johanna Chua, emerging markets Asia economist at Citi in Hong Kong. \n But if the grim outlook does not improve, under a worst-case scenario, economists expect growth in all countries polled to drop further by 0.5 percentage point to 1 full percentage point. \n ",

The first patients to fully recover in the region have already left hospital, according to official media. \n Over 1,100 people have died in China due to the coronavirus epidemic although most of the deaths and infections have been in the central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicentre of the outbreak. \n But representatives of the Uighur diaspora warn there is real reason to fear a rapid spread of coronavirus in the controversial Chinese camps. \n The virus spreads from person to person through droplets disseminated by sneezing or coughing, and confining large groups of people together, possibly without adequate access to germ-killing soap and water, will increase the likelihood of an outbreak. \n China has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic minorities in internment camps, NGOs and experts say, and little is known about the conditions inside them. \n Beijing insists the camps are \"vocational training centres\" necessary to combat terrorism. \n \"People are starting to panic. Our families are there, dealing with the camps and the virus, and we do not know if they have enough to eat or if they have masks,\" said Dilnur Reyhan, a French sociologist of Uighur origin. \n A petition posted on Change.org signed by over 3,000 people urges the closure of the camps to reduce the threat. \n There have also been social media hashtag campaigns such as #VirusThreatInThecamps and #WHO2Urumqi to urge the World Health Organisation (WHO) to send a delegation to the city of Xinjiang. \n \"We must not wait until news of hundreds of coronavirus-related deaths in the camps before we react,\" the petition says. \n \"As China continues to struggle to contain the virus in Wuhan, we can easily assume the virus will rapidly spread throughout the camps and affect millions if we don't raise the alarm now.\" \n Regional authorities in Xinjiang did not respond to a query from AFP about measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus in the camps. \n The World Uyghur Congress (WUC), one of several groups representing Uighurs outside China, said it was very concerned \"that if measures are not taken to further limit the spread of this virus, it could rapidly infect large numbers of people\" in Xinjiang. \n \"These people are in a vulnerable and weakened state due to the Chinese government's abuses and mistreatment,\" said its president Dolkun Isa. \n \"This has just further compounded the suffering of the Uighur people, as our friends and family are now in even greater danger.\" \n French immunologist Norbert Gualde said it was impossible to say precisely under what conditions the Uighurs and other detainees are living in Chinese camps. \n \"There are good reasons to think that their detention is synonymous with imposed proximity, stress and fear - all circumstances that favour the transmission of a virus between those obliged to remain incarcerated,\" he said. \n ",

Tests detect the presence of antigen and the result is obtained in 10 or 15 minutes.\nThe Spanish government has acquired 340.000 examinations and intended to test health workers and elderly people admitted to residences and then extend it to another population. The areas of Galicia, Andalusia and Madrid are running rapid tests, in which a sample is taken from the patient without him getting out of the car.\nThese tests purchased from China served as triage, i.e. when detecting a positive, the patient can already be diagnosed and treated appropriately. If the Chinese test was of sufficient quality, only negative or doubtful results would require a subsequent PCR to confirm, refers to the same publication from the indicated sources.\nIn other words, due to the low sensitivity of the purchased material from Bioeasy, it is not possible to make a large selection and test part of the population, since it is always necessary to do PCR work, i.e. in many cases patients would have to be tested again in laboratoryYeah.\nThe Spanish Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology (SEIMC) has issued a statement to which El Pais had access, informing Spanish health authorities that it is not recommended to use these rapid tests, but to continue with PCR tests.\nThe SEIMC document ensures that a \"rapid diagnosis of these cases at hospital level is relevant to identify, isolate and treat patients quickly\" and facilitate \"emergency decongement\". \"For this we need rapid tests with high sensitivity\", it adds.\nThe Ministry of Health also confirmed to the Spanish publication the poor results of the sensitivity and specificity analyses. The manufacturer was subsequently given an order to replace the tests and to have them, when obtained by the Spanish government, approved for use in Europe.\nThe Carlos III Institute of Health published a video on his Twitter account explaining how these tests work.\nResearchers of the National Microbiological Centre 35;ISCIII describes paso by paso in this video as soon as they use the rapid test that detects antigens of 35;coronavirus 35SARS-.u CoV as 2 to diagnose x35;COVID \\35;DivulgaonISCIII @ciegob @sanigobdad@SaludEs Publicapic.twitter.com/xxxfq Oxfffq\n(ii) Carlos III (ISCIII) Institute of Salud (@SaludISCIII) March 24, 2020\nSpain is following the recommendation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) by extending the tests to Covid-19 to more sections of the population.

        "news_content_translate_en": "On the afternoon of Tuesday, 17 March, the round table television programme discussed Cuba's strategy to control and prevent the expansion of covid-19, inviting the following panellists:\nDr. Francisco dur á n Garc í a, director of national epidemiology, Ministry of health and social welfare of Cuba, director of the centre for health promotion and disease prevention, Ministry of health and social welfare of Cuba, Dr. Jorge Delgado bustello Mar í a Guadalupe Guzman tirado, director of ipk research, diagnosis and reference center\nDr. Francisco dur á n Garc í a, director of national epidemiology, Ministry of public health (minsap), introduced the latest world development of SARS cov-2 coronary aneurysm, which is the cause of the risk of HIV / AIDS and infectious diseases.\nPhoto: screen capture shows that since the first case was found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, progress has been very rapid.\nHe explained that the latest figures showed that the number of countries with at least one case was 144. According to the latest data released on Tuesday, more than 180000 people were infected and more than 7000 died.\nDr. Duran Garcia stressed China's efforts to contain the virus and pointed out that more than 98000 people outside China had been infected with the virus, with a mortality rate of 4%, higher than during the most severe period in China.\nWith regard to the situation on the island, he confirmed the emergence of two new cases of covid-19 in Cuba, with seven patients diagnosed with the disease.\nHe pointed out that almost all infectious diseases have a feature that they are transmitted through contact with foreign infected persons.no\n\"We cannot talk about the presence of infectious diseases in our country, because when we start to find people with HIV, whether they have symptoms or not, they are associated with any infected people from abroad or with them. 'we are preparing for this,' he said.\nThis means that since January, Cuba has developed a plan for the prevention and control of the epidemic, and since then, a series of actions have been carried out under the leadership of the main national authorities in the country, as the disease requires cross sectoral prevention and treatment.\nThe director of the national epidemiology division of the Ministry of health added that the plan had incorporated knowledge of clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic characteristics.\nIn our country, there is no land border and good control. This advantage minimizes the risk of entering our country, because this person may be spreading disease and has not been detected at the time of entry.\nFrom the beginning, we have taken measures to isolate people with the characteristics of the disease in designated centres, enabling us to closely monitor nearly 25000 primary health care workers and anyone from countries at risk of the epidemic.\nTwo new cases of covid-19 have been reported, bringing the total number of infections in Cuba to seven.\nHe reported that today, the laboratory of the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical Medicine confirmed the diagnosis of Cuba's seventh case, almost all of whom came from countries of transmission, two of whom had very close ties with people abroad.\nOn the issue of quarantine, he pointed out that \"this measure is formulated in every country, because the situation of quarantine is becoming more complex, not international\".no\nIf the prescribed measures are taken and there is no evidence of the spread of the disease in a group of cases, then isolation is not justified.\nSimilarly, he explained that shutting down workplaces and educational institutions creates stress and stress, a process known to reduce the body's immune capacity and increase risk.\nAware of this, the country has taken measures in recent days to prevent population aggregation.\n4、 Why is Cuba not taking extreme measures?\nCommenting on why Cuba did not take extreme measures such as quarantine, he explained that quarantine was carried out by each country according to its characteristics. The World Health Organization has developed phased implementation measures.\nThe expert reiterated that all cases found in Cuba were not transmitted but were due to infection abroad.\n\"Segregation is determined on the basis of dissemination and there is no reason at present. 'we didn't try to get there,' he said.\nIt noted that it would also be unwise to close schools or workplaces before domestic broadcasting.\nIf there is no obvious spread and school closure, there will be additional pressure and reduced immunity. He stressed that Cuba noted and publicly announced that a highly populated group had ceased its activities. \"\nCuba and acute respiratory infections\nMar í a Guadalupe Guzm á n tirado, director of the research, diagnosis and reference centre, outlined acute respiratory infection (IRA), which experts believe is the cause of 3 to 5 million deaths worldwide. Despite the abuse of antibiotics and other secondary conditionsno\n\"` in other words, we have encountered this disease in history, most of which are viral, sometimes accompanied by inappropriate use of antibiotics, and confusion due to the similarity of symptoms such as pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, etc., he warned.\nHe said that Cuba has not evaded this reality. Anger is the main cause of death due to infection in our country, but it is also the cause of hospitalization, and in many cases it is also the cause of abuse of antibiotics, because most antibiotics are viral, although bacterial infection can also produce viruses. In addition, it has resulted in absenteeism and absenteeism.\nIn anger, he said, the virus dominates and produces a variety of symptoms, including nephritis, common cold and downhill pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and bronchitis in children. Different viruses can produce the same symptoms\nIn this regard, he stressed that the viruses we talked about include influenza A, influenza B, parasitic diseases, enteroviruses d68 and other emerging viruses and coronaviruses that shook the world in 2009.\nMonitoring of respiratory infections in the Cuban system\nThe director of ipk research, diagnosis and Reference Center pointed out that the coronary artery worm is a well-known virus population, which was identified in the 1930s as affecting many animals, such as birds, bats, rabbits, horses, mice and pigs, producing respiratory system and diarrhea, including nervous system.\nIn the 1960s, a group of coronary aneurysms were found, which affected people and became zoos. There are four basic principles, all monitored by Cuba.\nIn this global emergency, more active follow-up is under way, but national health systems monitor viral respiratory and bacterial infections on a daily basis.no\n\"Personal care can only be done by individuals,\" he said.\nDr. Guzman tirado explained that the coronary artery virus is a \"preputial soft virus RNA virus\" Because of these characteristics, people often talk about hand washing or using chlorine or alcohol as part of personal care to deal with these problems because they are easy to solve.\nPersonal care can only be done by everyone. When someone sneezes, if we touch any entrance, such as mouth, eyes or nose, we may be infected with any kind of virus. Therefore, frequent hand washing is required.\n\"However, the occurrence of coronary aneurysm in Wuhan at the end of 2019 is a new disease, which is known to be very similar to the isolated SARS in bats. Bats are a collection of different viruses.\"\nHe recalled that in 2009, mortality was high in the eastern Mediterranean, between 30 and 35 per cent, and that economic and social development in southern Africa had been strengthened. In 2012, the death rate of SARS in China was 9%, which was very serious.\nAs for the new coronary artery aneurysm virus, because it is similar to the SARS virus in bats, ipk experts believe that although there may be an unrecognized intermediate host, it is likely to come from bats.\n\"` when viewed through an electron microscope, its eyeball is similar to the crown, which is called the coronary artery.\nPhoto: screen capture technology is necessary for covid-19 detection.\nOn the other hand, Dr. Mar í a Guadalupe Guzman tirado, director of the ipk research, diagnosis and reference center, explained that acute respiratory infection was one of the causes of death among 3 to 5 million people worldwide, and Cuba was not spared.no These viruses may cause a range of different types of symptoms, so different viruses may produce the same symptoms.\nAccording to experts, this kind of coronary artery was diagnosed by the former nasofarinigeo, which is a cheap technology with a cost of up to $50. We have not only ipk, but also Villa Clara and Santiago in Cuba. \"We also have reagents, professionals, laboratories, equipment and so on,\" he said.\nWith regard to the Convention on the rights of the child, doctors stressed that the Convention has three main functions: Research on infectious diseases, specialized services and teaching. The center provides treatment for people living with HIV / AIDS in accordance with the protocol of the World Health Organization, China's experience and China's experience.\nIn terms of teaching, staff of the Cuban health system and other institutions, i.e. staff from different sectors, as well as trainers who impart knowledge in other centres, have been trained.\nIn addition, communication with scientists from other countries and the international health organization is not only for the treatment of coronary artery aneurysm, but also for the prevention and treatment of other diseases. The expert thanked the solidarity with Cuba.\nDiagnosis of new coronary artery\nThe diagnosis of this coronavirus was carried out through the former nasofarinegeo. In this case, we found the particles of the virus through the advanced molecular technology, the so-called real-time global warming potential, which was used to identify different types of viruses.\nThey are modern and expensive methods. Real time PSR testing could cost between $40 and $50, he said.no\nHe added that the technology was available at ipk in Cuba and at three laboratories at provincial health and epidemiological centres in Havana, Villa Clara and Santiago.\nPrevious photos\n4、 Strengthening community participation\n17. Pablo FeAl Canizares, head of the unit for health promotion and disease prevention, said that in Cuba, the health system has taken action to protect people. He said the plan is in line with the country's and the rest of the world's health experience.\nFamily doctor clinics and polyclinics have been organized to provide closer care, she said. The main task now is to identify vulnerable groups, such as people over 60 years of age or with respiratory diseases, those living alone and elderly homes.\nIn addition to the disinfection campaign, he argued, family doctors have intensified active investigations, prioritized the group and looked for respiratory symptoms in order to take immediate action.\nHe said the plan provided for certification of each process, explaining that more specialized training was now needed after training activities were carried out nationwide.\nAnyone can view this photo\nWith regard to the publicity plan, Pablo FeAl Ca ñ azas added that the level of public participation had increased and that the state media had provided timely and authentic information, highlighting the risks but not causing panic.\n\"The most important thing is to convey the message of trust, security and the need of the Cuban people for self-protection.\".\nAt the same time, media publicity and education materials have been produced, and interdepartmental participation has been increased. Each organization has its own missionno\nThe expert recommends that if respiratory symptoms occur, you should see a doctor as soon as possible and avoid leaving the country, and if you travel and return, you should be examined by the health authorities.\n\"Above all, Cubans have to be cautious, responsible and cautious,\" he said.\nHe reiterated that money laundering was the most effective measure to prevent the disease. As for the nasobuco people, he called on the Cubans to show their solidarity because they could make them in their own homes. \"The purpose of industrial production is to ensure that people in direct contact with infected or suspicious persons (such as doctors) wear masks.\".\n[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:TrackMoves/> <w:TrackFormatting/>

Colaboración Médica Cubana, precisó que la brigada médica cubana en el exterior está presente en 34 países que tienen reportes de la enfermedad.\nTodos los colaboradores cubanos han sido capacitados para enfrentarse a la enfermedad. A través de un grupo de WhatsApp se mantienen informados 24 horas y saben que tienen como premisa la protección. A la familia de estos compañeros queremos decirles que están protegidos, aseguróno\nWith regard to requests from other governments for support from Cuba, doctors explained that a decision on cooperation was being taken.\n(welcome SM Braemar's team is ready)\nWith regard to the movement of passengers on the MS Braemar cruiser, which will stop at the Cuban port on Wednesday morning, Dr. Duran Garcia pointed out that all measures had been taken at the landing site and at the airport to avoid danger to our people. He said.\nThis humanitarian action has been appreciated by many parts of the world and by others on board, who have emphasized the solidarity of the Cuban people.",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "3月17日星期二下午，圆桌会议电视节目讨论了古巴控制和防止COVID-19扩大的战略，邀请以下小组成员：\n•Francisco Durán García博士，古巴卫生和社会福利部国家流行病学主任，古巴卫生和社会福利部健康促进和疾病预防中心主任，Jorge Delgado Bustillo博士María Guadalupe Guzman Tirado，IPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任\n公共卫生部（MINSAP）国家流行病学主任Francisco Durán García博士介绍了SARS COV-2冠状动脉瘤的最新世界发展情况，该冠状动脉瘤是造成艾滋病毒/艾滋病的危险和传染性疾病的原因。\n照片：屏幕捕捉显示，自2019年12月在中国武汉市发现首例病例以来，进展非常迅速。\n他解释说，最新数字表明，至少有一个病例的国家数目为144个，根据本星期二公布的最新数据，有180 000多人感染，7 000多人死亡。\n杜兰·加西亚博士强调了中国为遏制这一病毒所作的努力，并指出，在中国境外，有98 000多人感染了这一病毒，死亡率为4%，高于中国感染最严重的时期。\n关于岛上的情况，他证实古巴出现了两个新的COVID-19病例，使七名患者被诊断患有这种疾病。\n他指出，几乎所有的传染病都有一个特点，即它们是通过与外国感染者接触传染的。否\n“我们不能谈论在我国存在传染病，因为当我们开始发现有艾滋病毒的人时，不管有没有症状，他们与来自国外的任何感染者或与他们有联系。他说，我们正在为这种情况做准备。\n这意味着，自1月份以来，古巴制定了预防和控制这一流行病的计划，自那时以来，在全国主要国家当局的领导下，开展了一系列行动，因为这一疾病需要跨部门的防治。\n卫生部国家流行病学司司长补充说，该计划已将各种临床、流行病和治疗特点的知识纳入其中。\n在我国，没有陆地边界，控制良好，这一优势最大限度地减少了进入我国的危险，因为这个人可能是在传播疾病，而且在入境时没有检测到。\n从一开始，我们就采取措施，在指定的中心隔离具有这种疾病特征的人，使我们能够密切监测近25 000名初级保健人员和来自有这种流行病危险的国家的任何人。\n据报告，有两个新的COVID-19病例，使古巴的感染者总数达到7人。\n他报告说，今天，Pedro Kouri热带医学研究所实验室证实了对古巴第七例病例的诊断，几乎所有的人都来自传播国，其中两人与国外的人有非常密切的联系。\n关于检疫问题，他指出，“这一措施是在每个国家内制定的，因为检疫的情况正在变得更加复杂，而不是国际性的”。否\n如果采取了规定的措施，并且有一组病例没有证据表明该疾病的传播，那么隔离是没有道理的。\n同样，他解释说，关闭工作场所和教育机构造成了压力和压力，这一过程已知会降低人体的免疫能力，并增加风险。\n该国意识到这一点，最近几天已经采取措施防止人口聚集。\n四、为什么古巴没有采取极端措施？\n他在评论古巴为何没有采取检疫等极端措施时解释说，检疫是由每个国家根据其特点采取的。世界卫生组织制定了分阶段实施的措施。\n该专家重申，在古巴发现的所有病例都不是通过传播，而是由于在国外感染。\n“隔离是根据传播情况确定的，目前没有理由。他说，我们努力不到那个时候。\n它指出，在国内广播之前关闭学校或工作场所也是不明智的。\n如果没有明显的传播和关闭学校，就会产生额外的压力，降低免疫能力。他强调说，古巴注意并公开宣布，一个人口高度集中的团体已经停止活动。”\n古巴和急性呼吸道感染\n研究、诊断和参考中心主任María Guadalupe Guzmán Tirado概括地提到急性呼吸道感染（IRA），专家认为，急性呼吸道感染是全世界300万至500万人死亡的原因。尽管滥用抗生素和其他次要情况也起到了作用否\n“`换言之，我们在历史上曾遇到过这种疾病，其中大多数是病毒性的，有时还伴随着不适当地使用抗生素，以及由于诸如肺炎、支气管肺炎等症状的相似性而产生的混淆，他提出警告。\n他说，古巴并没有逃避这一现实，愤怒是我国因感染而死亡的主要原因，但愤怒也是住院的原因，而且在许多情况下也是滥用抗生素的原因，因为大多数抗生素是病毒性的，尽管细菌感染也会产生病毒。此外，这也造成了旷课和缺勤。\n他说，在愤怒中，病毒占据了主要位置，产生了各种各样的症状，包括肾炎、常见感冒和下丘陵性肺炎、支气管肺炎和儿童支气管炎。不同的病毒可以产生相同的症状\n在这方面，他强调，我们谈论的病毒包括2009年震撼世界的流感A、流感B、寄生虫病、肠道病毒D68等新出现的病毒以及冠状病毒。\n监测古巴系统的呼吸道感染情况\nIPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任指出，冠状动脉虫是一个众所周知的病毒群体，在1930年代被确定为影响到许多动物，如鸟类、蝙蝠、兔子、马、老鼠和猪，产生呼吸系统和腹泻，包括神经系统。\n在1960年代，发现了一组冠状动脉瘤，它们影响到人，变成了动物园。有四个基本原则，都由古巴监测。\n在这一全球紧急情况下，目前正在采取更加积极的后续行动，但国家卫生系统每天都在监测病毒性呼吸道感染和细菌感染。否\n他说，“个人护理只能由个人来做”。\nGuzman Tirado医生解释说冠状动脉病毒是“包皮病毒软体病毒RNA病毒”由于这些特点，人们经常谈论洗手或使用氯或酒精作为个人护理的一部分来处理这些问题，因为这些问题很容易得到解决。\n个人护理只能由每个人来做。当有人打喷嚏时，如果我们碰到任何一个入口，例如嘴巴、眼睛或鼻子，我们就可能感染任何一种病毒。因此，需要经常性的洗手。\n“然而，2019年底在武汉出现的冠状动脉瘤是一种新的疾病，已知与蝙蝠体内孤立的非典有很大的相似性，蝙蝠是不同病毒的集合。”\n他回顾说，在2009年，地中海东部地区的死亡率很高，在30%至35%之间，南部非洲经济和社会发展得到加强。而在2012年，中国的非典型性肺炎死亡率为9%，表现得很严重。\n关于新的冠状动脉瘤病毒，由于它与蝙蝠的非典病毒相似，IPK专家认为，虽然可能有一个尚未被承认的中间宿主，但它很可能来自蝙蝠。\n“`当通过电子显微镜观察时，它的眼球与皇冠相似，它被称为冠状动脉。\n照片：屏幕捕捉技术是进行COVID-19检测所必需的。\n另一方面，IPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任María Guadalupe Guzman Tirado博士解释说，急性呼吸道感染是全世界300万至500万人死亡的原因之一，古巴也没有幸免。否这些病毒可能导致一系列不同类型的症状，因此不同的病毒可能产生相同的症状。\n据专家说，这种冠状动脉是通过以前的Nasofarinigeo诊断出来的，这是一种不便宜的技术，其成本高达50美元。我们在古巴不仅有IPK，而且还有Villa Clara和Santiago。他说，“我们还有试剂、专业人员、实验室、设备等”。\n关于《儿童权利公约》，医生强调，该公约有三大职能：传染病研究、专门服务和教学。该中心根据世界卫生组织的议定书、中国的经验和中国的经验，为感染者和艾滋病毒/艾滋病患者提供治疗。\n在教学方面，古巴卫生系统和其他机构的工作人员，即来自不同部门的工作人员，以及在其他中心传授知识的培训人员，已经接受了培训。\n此外，还与其他国家的科学家以及国际卫生组织进行交流，不仅是为了治疗冠状动脉瘤，而且是为了防治其他疾病。该专家感谢对古巴的声援。\n关于新冠状动脉的诊断\n对这种冠状病毒的诊断是通过以前的Nasofarinegeo进行的，在这种情况下，我们通过先进的分子技术，即所谓的实时全球升温潜能值，发现了病毒的粒子，这种技术被用来识别不同类型的病毒。\n它们是现代和昂贵的方法。他说，实时PSR测试可能需要40到50美元。否\n他补充说，这项技术可在古巴的IPK以及设在哈瓦那、Villa Clara和Santiago的省级卫生和流行病中心的三个实验室获得。\n上一组照片\n四、加强社区的参与\n17.促进健康和预防疾病股股长Pablo Feal Canizares说，在古巴，保健系统采取了保护人民的行动。他说，该计划符合该国和世界其他国家的卫生经验。\n她说，家庭医生诊所和综合诊所都已组织起来，以提供更密切的护理。目前的主要任务是查明弱势群体，如60岁以上或患有呼吸道疾病的人、独居者和老人院。\n他争辩说，除了消毒行动外，家庭医生还加强了积极的调查，优先考虑这一群体，并寻找呼吸症状，以便立即采取行动。\n他说，该计划规定对每一个进程进行认证，同时解释说，在全国范围内开展培训活动之后，现在需要进行更加专业化的培训。\n任何人都可以查看此相片\n关于宣传计划，Pablo Feal Cañazas补充说，民众的参与程度有所提高，国家媒体提供了及时、真实的信息，强调了风险，但没有造成恐慌。\n“最重要的是传达信任、安全和古巴人民需要自我保护的信息”。\n与此同时，还制作了媒体宣传教育材料，同时增加了部门间的参与。每个机构都有自己的任务否\n该专家建议，如果出现呼吸症状，应尽快向医生看病，并避免离开该国，如果旅行和返回，则由卫生当局检查。\n他说，“最重要的是，古巴人必须保持谨慎，负责任和谨慎”。\n他重申，洗钱是预防这一疾病的最有效措施。至于Nasobuco人，他呼吁古巴人给予声援，因为他们可以在自己家里制作。“工业生产的目的是确保直接接触感染者或可疑者（如医生）的人员戴面罩。”.\n[如果gte
