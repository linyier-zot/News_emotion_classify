Onshore, the yuan fell to its lowest in over a week at 6.9094.\nCurrencies linked to Chinese trade and tourism also dropped. The Australian dollar touched its lowest in over a month at $0.68445. The New Zealand dollar fell as much as a third of a percent to $0.6589 before recovering some ground. The Korean won dropped 0.6%.\n“The markets are attributing the selloff to concern about the SARS-like virus in China, but it’s difficult to know if it is that or by and a large a reversal of the recent price action,” said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG.\nIn contrast, the yen gained 0.15% to 110\n.05 per dollar as investors moved into safe-haven assets like the yean and U.S. Treasuries. The Swiss franc rose to 0.96750 to the dollar.\nThe dollar index, which measures its value against a basket of six currencies, was down at 97.481 — near the highest level in a month.\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, U.S. President Donald Trump said negotiations with China over a phase-two trade deal will start soon. The phase-one deal signed last week boosted confidence in the world economic outlook, supporting the dollar.\nThe euro and sterling gained against the dollar .\nSterling benefited from news that Britain’s economy created jobs at its fastest rate in nearly a year in the three months to November, potentially undermining the case for a Bank of England interest rate cut next week.\nThe pound was last up 0.3% at $1.3053. The euro held a narrow range around $1.1105 before Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting.\nThe mood among German investors brightened far more than expected in January on hopes Germany’s economy might not be hurt as much by trade tensions as previously thought, a survey from Germany’s ZEW research institute showed.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan kept its short-term interest rate target at minus 0.1% and its pledge to guide 10-year government bond yields around zero.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE - All public hospital emergency departments here are on \"outbreak response mode\" as Singapore raises its defences against a mysterious virus that is spreading in China. \n \"We cannot rule out the possibility that the new (Wuhan) virus will reach Singapore,\" Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), told The Straits Times. The stakes are higher now that the virus has started spreading from human to human. \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. All general practice doctors have also been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspected patients. \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be cleaned before it is used again. \n At the NCID, the patients will be placed in special negative-pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. \n Prof Leo said the NCID has \"high-end\" Hepa filters in 124 negative-pressure isolation rooms which clean 99.999 per cent of contaminants, including viruses. \n As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n It will take the laboratory between four and eight hours to determine if the patient is infected with a coronavirus. If that test proves positive, genetic sequencing will be done to confirm that it is the new bug. That takes 24 hours. \n Prof Leo said there are a lot of coronaviruses but only seven, including this new one, that spread from human to human\n. \n Four types cause the common cold and are mild. The other two are the more dangerous Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). \n A negative-pressure isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n The negative-pressure ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Fifteen medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the bug, currently called the 2019-nCoV. \n Prof Leo said that it is not yet known whether this virus is as dangerous as Sars. \n But Singapore is not taking chances. All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE). Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air-purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. \n Prof Leo said Singapore has a stockpile of the disposable PPE as well as the powered air-purifying respirators - enough to supply all hospitals, should a major outbreak occur here. \"Yes it is expensive, but protection of staff is the most important thing,\" said Prof Leo, a veteran of the Sars outbreak in 2003, when medical staff caring for infected patients were among the 238 people infected and the 33 who died. \n The 330-bed NCID, which opened slightly over a year ago, has more than 100 \"surge beds\", which are kept empty and on standby for national emergencies. \n All medical staff dealing with suspected cases are well protected with personal protective equipment (PPE). Laboratory staff will also have PPE and powered air-purifying respirators - to filter out any possible virus. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. ST PHOTO: DESMOND FOO \n Although the flu vaccine does not protect against the Wuhan bug, she said it is a good idea to get vaccinated. On a national level, it will \"cut down on the background noise\"\n. \n She added that should there be a positive case of the Wuhan bug here, people will be told. \n \"We need to be able to share the information and be able to guide the public, as well as the entire public healthcare system, to be able to handle the situation,\" she said. \n WIDER DEFINITION \n Singapore's Ministry of Health has widened its definition of suspect cases, and it will now include anyone with pneumonia who had been to China - not just Wuhan - within 14 days of the start of the illness. Anyone with acute respiratory infection who has been to any hospital in China within a fortnight of getting ill will also be treated as a suspect case. \n MORE SCREENINGS \n From today, Changi Airport will conduct temperature screening for all flights from China, and not just those from Wuhan. So far, all seven suspected cases in Singapore have proven not to have the Wuhan bug. \n SUSPECT CASES \n All patients at emergency departments are screened, and those with fever and travel history are isolated. At the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), the patients will be placed in special negative pressure isolation rooms, where air flows only into the rooms, not out of them. \n The air in the rooms is sucked out through high-efficiency particulate air, or Hepa, filters. As an extra precaution, even after it has gone through the filters, the air is further cleaned with ultraviolet rays. \n GP DOCS ON THE WATCH \n All general practice doctors have been told what to look out for and given a number to call if there are any suspect patients. \n SPECIAL AMBULANCES \n Any such call from a doctor will activate a special ambulance which will transport the suspected patient, aged above 16, straight to the NCID. Those 16 and younger will be taken to KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital. This is to nip the spread of the virus in the bud. The ambulance will then be properly cleaned before it is used again. \n • Avoid contact with live animals, including poultry and birds\n.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — From Wednesday (Jan 22), the Ministry of Health (MOH) will introduce more precautionary measures in order to reduce the risk of a new coronavirus being imported into Singapore, casting the net wider to isolate more people who may be exposed to the Wuhan virus.  \n In a statement on Tuesday, which came less than 24 hours after it announced that all travellers arriving at Changi Airport on flights from China will have to undergo temperature screening from Wednesday, MOH said that from Wednesday, too, people arriving in Singapore who have pneumonia and developed symptoms within 14 days after travelling to China will be isolated.  \n Those who have acute respiratory infection and developed symptoms within 14 days after being in any hospital in China will also be isolated.  \n These suspected cases will be isolated in hospital as a precautionary measure to prevent transmission. \n Previously, only those who have fever and pneumonia, and developed symptoms within 14 days after travelling to Wuhan in China would be isolated. \n Suspected cases meeting the widened definition will be referred to hospitals for further assessment. \n The authorities in China have confirmed on Monday that the virus can spread from human to human, and the number of pneumonia cases linked to the virus have risen both in China and in other Asian countries. \n The outbreak of the virus was first reported at Wuhan city in the Hubei province of China, and it is believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there that also sells live animals. \n The virus, known as 2019-nCoV, is called a novel (new) coronavirus because it is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, the World Health Organization (WHO) said\n. It is in the same family as the ones that caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), as well as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which killed almost 800 people worldwide from 2002 to 2003, including 33 in Singapore. \n Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Investigations found that the Sars virus was transmitted from civet cats to humans and the one causing Mers was from one-hump camels to humans, WHO said.  \n In rare instances, coronaviruses can evolve and then spread from human to human.  \n TAIWAN SEES FIRST INFECTION \n A panel from WHO will meet in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday to consider whether to declare an international public health emergency over the virus, the way it did with swine flu and Ebola. This could mean a call for a co-ordinated international response to the outbreak. \n Following exported cases in Japan, South Korea and Thailand, Taiwan reported its first confirmed case on Tuesday when a Taiwanese woman returned from Wuhan, had fever, and tested positive for 2019-nCoV. \n Close to 300 cases have now been reported across major cities in China, including Beijing and Shanghai. \n  \n Symptoms of the pneumonia that is linked to the virus include a fever, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, among others. \n At Changi Airport, health advisory posters have been put up to advise all travellers on the precautionary measures to take when travelling to or arriving from Wuhan. \n MOH first started taking precautions since the start of the year, with temperature screening at Changi Airport for travellers arriving on flights from Wuhan, and suspected cases have been referred to hospitals for further assessment. \n SUSPECTED CASES IN SINGAPORE \n As of 3pm on Tuesday, MOH has not been notified of any new cases.  \n The seventh suspected case, a 44-year-old female Singapore resident with pneumonia who had travelled to Wuhan, tested negative for coronavirus, the ministry said\n. \n With medical practitioners being told to look out for pneumonia cases, MOH said that Singapore will likely see more patients who need to be tested because it “cannot rule out the possibility of imported cases”.  \n “To date, there have been no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus reported in Singapore. However, given the high volume of international travel to Singapore, we expect to see more suspected cases, and possibly imported cases,” MOH said.  \n “Once a case is confirmed, contact tracing will be initiated, and we will implement strict isolation, quarantine, and infection control and prevention measures to prevent further transmission,” it added.  \n MOH urges the public to remain vigilant and to adopt good personal hygiene practices.  \n “All travellers to China should monitor their health closely and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell, and also inform their doctor of their travel history,” it said.  \n MOH also advised travellers and members of the public to adopt the following precautions at all times: \n Avoid contact with live animals including poultry and birds, and consumption of raw and undercooked meats \n Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness \n Observe good personal hygiene \n Practise frequent hand-washing with soap, for example, before handling food or eating, after going to the toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing \n Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or runny nose \n Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately \n Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell. \n TOUR AGENCY TO MONITOR SITUATION \n Travel agency Dynasty Travel told TODAY that it does not offer tours to China until March 2020, which is when the peak travel period usually starts\n.  \n It does not offer tours to Wuhan and the closest tour to Wuhan is Changsha, which is four hours away by coach.  \n Ms Alicia Seah, director of communications at Dynasty Travel, said that Singaporeans tend to avoid the January to February period because the Chinese New Year holidays are quite packed with travellers. \n She added: “We are closely monitoring the situation, and are hopeful that the authorities will handle the situation well. If the situation worsens, we will offer traveling alternatives to our customers or even postpone tours.” \n The travel agency will also be providing N95 masks for customers, avoiding visits to places with live animals, and will not serve meals with raw meat.\n",

China also would step up cooperation with the WHO, Li added.\nOfficials found to have covered up infections would be a “sinner for eternity before the Party and the people”, the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Political and Legal Commission said in a post on its WeChat social media account that was subsequently deleted\n.\n“I’m not sure that we could expect more of them at this stage in the outbreak, particularly when they are understandably focused on responding to the outbreak and trying to contain it ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the Centre for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney.\nFears of a pandemic similar to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak that started in China and killed nearly 800 people in 2002-2003 have roiled global markets, with aviation and luxury goods stocks hit particularly hard and the Chinese yuan tumbling.\nThe WHO said on Tuesday the new coronavirus was likely to spread to other parts of China and possibly other countries in coming days.\nWHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said new cases would appear as China stepped up monitoring. “If you increase surveillance and testing you are likely to get new numbers,” he added.\nHong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, one of the airlines affected the most by the SARS outbreak, said it would allow flight attendants to wear a surgical mask while operating mainland China flights due to concerns over the new virus.\nThe Cathay Pacific Airways Flight Attendants Union said it had received a “tremendous” amount of messages from members concerned over catching the virus, and attendants on all flights should have the option to wear a mask.\n“All of them are worried about the risk they are taking every time they go to work,” the union said on its Facebook page.\nTaiwan joined Australia in warning citizens to avoid travel to Wuhan, and airports around the world have stepped up screening of travellers from China.\n“I want to call on our nationals please not to visit this region if not necessary,” Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen wrote on her Facebook page.\nA Bank of Korea official said worries over the virus may impact domestic consumer spending.\nFifteen medical personnel are among those infected in China\n. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. The viral infection can cause pneumonia and can be passed from person to person.\nThough the origin of the virus has yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan’s seafood market.\n",

The virus has spread beyond China’s borders, raising concerns of a global pandemic.\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses common in animals, including camels and bats. Most human coronaviruses, such as the common cold, typically cause mild-to-moderate illness, but some are capable of causing severe disease.\nThe following are coronaviruses that have caused severe major human outbreaks in the past 20 years:\nSARS-CoV - Cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, first emerged in 2002 in China. The highly infectious virus  quickly spread to 37 countries globally. Before it was contained in 2003, the virus had infected 8,098 people and killed 774. SARS symptoms included fever, chills, and body aches and   usually progressed to pneumonia. No cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2012, the United States declared SARS-CoV a select agent - meaning it is capable of posing a severe threat to public health and safety.\nMERS-CoV - The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus first emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has caused severe illness in people in more than 26 countries. The virus is thought to have emerged from camels, but it acquired the ability to be transmitted from human to human. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath, often leading to pneumonia. About 35% of people infected with MERS died, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Only two U.S. patients ever tested positive for MERS-CoV - infected healthcare workers in 2014 who had traveled to the United States from Saudi Arabia\n.\n2019-CoV - The novel coronavirus that has already infected more than 300 people in China, has been confirmed to be transmitted by people. Common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties. The virus has so far spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea. Some countries including Australia and the United States have begun screening passengers at airports who have traveled from China, particularly Wuhan. WHO officials are meeting this week to consider whether this virus should be deemed a global health emergency. CDC officials said last week it is highly plausible there will be cases in the United States.\n",

Georgi bashekin, chief of the molecular evolution section of the information transmission Research Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences, introduced this situation.\nViruses are most like pathogens extracted from bats. It can be cautiously assumed that the transmission of animals to humans was carried out by hand winged mammals or some related intermediate link, Bazekin explained that, like other corona\nThe Chinese authorities (31 December 2019) reported to the World Health Organization (who) that an unknown outbreak of viral pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, central China. On January 7, Chinese experts discovered a disease pathogen, corona virus 2019 ncov.\nThe number of new cases of pneumonia in China has risen to 291, the National Health Commission reported on January 21. Three other Asian countries - Japan, South Korea and Thailand - reported separate 2019 ncov cases. So far, six residents in Wuhan have died of the disease, Chinese media reported\nAbout\n\"This time, our Chinese colleagues worked very well and soon got data on the genetic structure of the virus. These sequences are public. The comparison shows that they are very similar to SARS, SARS virus, Issued in the people's Republic of China and neighboring countries in 2002. It's important to understand that it's not the same virus, but it's very close to it. \"\nNew threats\nAs bathkin points out, the new virus belongs to the same group as the well-known SARS and mers, that is, the pathogen of SARS and Middle East fever. In the past decade, these two viruses have claimed hundreds of lives in the Middle East and East Asia and have repeatedly caused epidemics, Spread through camels and poultry.\nThe pathogen of all three diseases is the so-called coronavirus. Their infection causes similar symptoms: fever, cough, respiratory problems, and persistent phlegm. The incubation period was 12 days, and then the fever started immediately. In general, about half of patients die from malnutrition, complications or related infections.\nWe cannot rule out that the virus is not transmitted to humans through bats, but through other ways.\nAbout On the other hand, there is evidence that it was produced by pigs or other pets, and there is no new virus for the first time in the seafood market. We can only guess how it happened. \"\nHe said the data available to scientists do not indicate when a vaccine for the disease will be developed. At the same time, it can stop the spread of viral pneumonia in China. In East Asia, it's the lunar new year, which epidemiologists are worried about, During this period, a large number of residents from China and neighboring countries traveled to other cities and countries.\n\"According to current very rough estimates, the highest number of infected people is about 1700, while the number of inpatients is much smaller. It can only be said now that the virus can be passed from person to person, and how sustainable its transmission is - it is not clear yet. Transfer to Russia cannot be ruled out in principle. In the era of SARS, we have had one case of infection. \"\nAt the same time, basekin said he believed that simple ways to control infection included thermal imagers at airports and other places where people gathered, It helps to control the outbreak of pneumonia and prevent it from becoming a bigger epidemic.\nAbout Scientists hope that China and other countries can avoid taking more stringent measures in response to SARS.\n",

According to a case study published in 2014 in The Journal of\nInfectious Diseases, a woman infected with MERS had a stillbirth.\nTill date, there is no vaccine to protect against this family of viruses.\nHowever, based on currently available information, the WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel or trade\n.\n'Countries are encouraged to continue strengthening their preparedness for health emergencies in line with the international health regulations,' the WHO said in a statement.\nIt said standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs.\nWHO also advises that people should avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.\n",

They are people who have been in an area with coronavirus, but have no symptoms.

The alarm landing the plane can generate citizenship is normal -for the novelty of the virus- but lacking arguments. Dr. Padilla explains why.\nIs there a risk of contagion in Madrid?\nThe risk is now none, because there is no case in Spain. Although it seems a very transmissible virus [it has had a rapid spread], can only happen if you have traveled to that particular area of ​​China or had contact with people who have done it. But today the risk is zero.\nIs it advisable to take precautions?\nCurrently we do not have to do anything other than be aware of new information that gives the Ministry of Health and follow their recommendations as well as those published by the Community of Madrid. No need to go to pharmacies for masks or we use alcohol hand sanitizer for all and everywhere. We must take the same precautions apply with influenza or other viruses that visit us every year, for example, never coughing into hands, but in a handkerchief and then discarded or elbow.\nHow Madrid is ready to meet the arrival of evacuated citizens?\nTranquility has to be high, public health in Spain and Madrid is excellent, with excellent services microbiology and large hospitals that offer services where you can do the test for the virus if necessary, though, for now who has officially confirmed any suspicions is the National Microbiology Center (CNM) in Majadahonda.\nWhat if a case appeared in the Community?\nAlso tranquility would have to be absolute. We have two hospitals with isolation units, La Paz-Carlos III and Gómez Ulla military hospital, where patients could be. So far this untreatable virus, nor have many other viruses, and what they need are good supportive care. Oxygen in case of pneumonia, for example, or good intensive care services. Hospitals are putting up multidisciplinary teams to adopt the measures of the protocol of the Community of Madrid, formed by emergency physicians, preventive, microbiology, infectious and medical UVI.\nThe protocol to which Dr. Padilla refers establishes guidelines for handling possible cases when symptoms give the Ministry of Health has collected into a document. \"The most common include cough, sore throat, fever and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, a major difficulty breathing, kidney failure and even death. The most serious cases usually occur in elderly or suffering from some other disease such as of the heart, lung or immune problems. \" Although not yet known precisely how the infection occurs, the most accepted form is through contact and by droplets expelled to coughing.\nThe document states that \"in the first contact with patients who come to hospital emergency\" is necessary to ask if you have traveled to the province of Hubei in China, in the 14 days before the onset of symptoms or has been in contact with a probable or confirmed case of 2019-nCoV. If affirmative answer was, start the first part of the protocol, which involves the placement of surgical mask for both patient and staff to accompany him and isolation in a single habituation to the corresponding tests.\nIf the suspicion is confirmed, it would be reported immediately to Public Health and the necessary samples be extracted to send to the National Center for Microbiology (which should communicate the results in less than 24 hours), while the patient would have to remain in isolation to get the results.\nAnd \"if the clinical condition of the patient has severity criteria before knowing the diagnosis pending the result of the laboratory of the CNM, prior authorization for public health, may be transferred the patient to the referral hospital: Hospital La Paz-Carlos III\" says the document of the Ministry. In that case, \"Public Health who will perform communication to the Hospital La Paz-Carlos III and contact Summa 112 to transport the patient.\"\nThe Minister of Health believes it is essential to give information and give it responsibly: \"We must be expectantly, yes, but calm. And raise awareness of what is reality. Now, today, the population is not at risk \". If you ever happen, the region, claims the director, \"is absolutely ready\". Explains that this Thursday was updated with the latest information and with the Ministry of Health, the protocol for primary and hospital care and the management of patients suspected: \"Both epidemiological part as healthcare, is all scheduled and defined.

Guarding that information there, in Madrid, a specific committee as the Minister has already met three times and comprises the whole spectrum of specialists required by the situation, \"in perfect coordination\" with the Ministry. \"In any case, if a case occurs, Madrid has the care dimension list for what may come.

But you had connected ECMO machine (ECMO), a system that blows air in the lungs and pumps blood through the circulatory system, so still alive, artificially sustained.\nWith this announcement, the hospital managed to stop the flood of mourning in some unusual levels in China, a doctor who had become a national hero. And whose death, that of a young man with no apparent previous health problems-a very different profile man who authorities describe as the most common victim of the virus, a person over 70 years with other previous ones ailments could generate a popular reaction that would endanger the sacrosanct priority for the Chinese regime, social stability. Finally, the hospital has announced that, this time, had died.\nThe doctor, 34, married with one child and another on the way, had written a message on December 30 in a group of former colleagues of the faculty in social networks. As he explained in his hospital in Wuhan they had admitted seven patients, all with very similar symptoms to SARS, the epidemic caused by another coronavirus that in 2003 killed nearly 800 people. Li also stated that seven patients had some type of relationship with the market seafood Huanan, which also sold all kinds of wild animals and subsequently identified as the place where the infection was transmitted to humans.\nWhen he wrote the message, Li did not intend to disseminate information beyond your circle of friends. Simply asked his former colleagues to be careful and to warn their families. But someone in the group began to spread and networks did the rest. Four days later she received a visit from the police: he was accused of \"spreading rumors\", a charge that China may account for up to seven years in prison. Seven other doctors also received the same charge.\nIn his case, Li had to go to the police station and sign a statement in which he admitted his fault and promised not to repeat before being allowed to return home.\nOn January 8 he attended in the hospital a patient with glaucoma, not knowing it was a carrier of the virus. Day 10 began to feel ill with symptoms that pathogen that causes sore throat, dry cough, fever, difficulty breathing. Two days later he had to be admitted to a hospital, where he continued to worsen.\nFinally, on February 1 he received the diagnosis. He is suffering from atypical pneumonia that can cause the virus, which was commissioned to communicate himself in his account Weibo, the Chinese Twitter. \"Today has come the nucleic acid test with a positive result. The die is cast, finally diagnosed, \"he wrote.\nLi's case had fueled the fury of a Chinese audience that since the blockade of Wuhan and over half of cities in Hubei province most affected by the epidemic, had strongly criticized the management of the authorities at the beginning of was declared crisis.\nHave allowed the public to lend ears complaints of eight doctors, the cry lamented networks, citizens could have taken precautions. And if the local authorities, rather than silence them, had done to them, they would have been forced to take measures that would brake before the spread of the disease. Now the virus has killed more than 500 people and infected more than 28,000 in China and nearly thirty countries.\nLast week, the Supreme Court of China itself gave reason to these criticisms. He issued an opinion in which he was very critical of the behavior of the police. He claimed, should be allowed to circulate warning doctors. Although it was not a 100% certain though related, the new coronavirus is different from the cause of the SARS-would have enabled people wearing masks to guard or avoiding crowds.\nFrom his hospital bed, and while he received thousands of messages of thanks and encouragement of many Internet users through social networks, sending short texts of tranquility in Weibo: they had not withdrawn the license to practice as a result of the complaint; Nor he would denounce the police. It was enough that the truth be known.\nThursday suffered heart failure that caused numerous Chinese media announced his death. The World Health Organization was quick to pay tribute. In a tweet, he declared himself \"deeply saddened by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. We should all celebrate the work he did on the # 2019-nCoV \".\nIn WeChat, the Chinese WhatsApp and other social networks are also tributes citizens sadness and anger multiplied to the doctor, in an unprecedented wave by its number. \"It's awful. It really is a death that should not have happened. She was so young. I'm sorry, \"said one netizen who identified himself as\" Ai Dandan \". \"This time the five-star red flag (China) is in debt to you,\" said another.\nFollowing the announcement of the hospital, pain messages were exchanged for other spirits. Although some seemed already anticipating an announcement of the death in the future, when that would possibility draft between the population and the reaction of public opinion was, predictably, less angry: \"Remember then how we feel now,\" noted a user network . Now, at dawn in China, he has become the wave of messages of mourning following the confirmation of the death of Li Wenliang, also confirmed in Weibo.",

Most patients who have died are above 60 and had pre-existing conditions, according to reports from local authorities.\nThe coronavirus can be passed between humans through close contact, Chinese medical experts say.\nThe novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak may reach its peak in one week or around 10 days, Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said.\n\"It is very difficult to definitely estimate when the outbreak reaches its peak. But I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be large-scale increases,\" Zhong told state-run Xinhua news agency.\nZhong is the head of a national team of experts set up for the control and prevention of the novel coronavirus-caused pneumonia and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering\n.\n\"There are two keys to tackling the epidemic: early detection and early isolation. They are the most primitive and most effective methods,\" he said.\nZhong said fever and weakness were the typical symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection found in the majority of patients.\nTen to 14 days is a sound period for isolation and observation. When the incubation period ends, those who fall sick will get timely treatment and those who do not will be just fine, he said.\nHe suggested that hospitals be staffed with not only infectious disease specialists, but also specialists in treating severe cases to better save patients.\nEpidemiologically, the novel coronavirus is homologous to the virus discovered in a type of bat in 2017, said Zhong, adding that the 2019-nCoV probably has an intermediate host that may be a certain kind of wild animal.\n\"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak lasted about six months, but I don't believe the novel coronavirus outbreak would last that long,\" said Zhong.\nThe country has taken a series of powerful measures, especially early detection and early isolation.\n\"We have sufficient confidence in preventing a major outbreak or a recurrence as long as the two measures are in place, although we still need to conduct much scientific research,\" he said.\nNoting that the key for Wuhan is how to reduce infections inside hospitals, Zhong said he supported the construction of makeshift hospitals in the city to control the infectious disease.\nThe activation of top-level public health emergency response was aimed at reducing the chance of infection, he said, adding that the vaccine development may need three to four months or even longer.\n\"Now scientists are speeding up research of neutralizing antibodies of the virus, but it takes time. With help from across the country, Wuhan, a heroic city, will pull through,\" Zhong said.\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called the coronavirus a \"demon\" which should be brought under control\n.\nChina has ramped up efforts to contain the virus. The country has extended the New Year Festival holidays till February 2 to prevent reverse migration of millions of migrants works to return to their work from holidays.\nUniversities, primary and middle schools and kindergartens across the country will postpone the opening of the spring semester until further notice.\nThe government is focussing efforts to prevent mass gatherings and mass travel to ensure the virus is not spread fast.\nBeijing has also launched temperature detection at 55 subway stations, including stops at railway stations and Beijing airport. Passengers with abnormal body temperatures will be sent to hospital.\n",

Air India has suspended its Delhi-Shanghai flight and curtailed the flight operations on the Delhi-Hong Kong route.\nAn Air India spokesperson said at 9.45 am, \"323 passengers and seven Maldivians were there in the second special flight from Wuhan, which landed at Delhi airport just now.\"\nFive doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, who were onboard the first flight, were also present in the second flight, the spokesperson said.\nOut of the 324 people that have been evacuated through first Air India flight, 56, 53 and 42 are from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, respectively.\n\nFour Indians could not board the second flight after they reported high temperatures, Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri said.\nThey may be quarantined to undergo tests to determine whether they have symptoms of the coronavirus, officials said.\nTwenty-five others stayed back, Misri said, adding that there may still be about 100 Indians who remained in Hubei province for which Wuhan is the provincial capital - the city where the virus first emerged in late December\n.\nAhead of the evacuation, the Indian Embassy had informed its stranded citizens that they have to undergo health tests before boarding the flight and also undergo a 14-day quarantine in special camps after reaching India.\nMisri said that it was one of the most complex operations for the Indian officials as the entire evacuation process had to be conducted in Wuhan and Hubei province, which were under total lock down with all transportation including private vehicles banned as part of measures to curb the virus.\n\nThe entire operation needed to be conducted about 500-km away, he said.\nIndian diplomats Deepak Padmakumar and M Balakrishnan were on the ground to coordinate evacuation operations with the Chinese, he said.\nBesides the complicated process of identifying the stranded Indians and their addresses in the sprawling city and the province, the Indian Embassy in coordination with the Chinese officials arranged buses to pick them up from different destinations to drive them to airport.\nThe Indian Army has set up a quarantine facility in Manesar near Delhi to keep those evacuated from China's virus-hit province. They would be monitored for any signs of infection for two weeks by a qualified team of doctors and staff members.\n\nThe evacuation of seven stranded Maldivian citizens along with Indians signifies the importance India attaches to its relations with the countries in the immediate neighbourhood, officials said.\nAir India has done such evacuations earlier also from countries such as Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Nepal.\nWhile India, the United States, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and many countries evacuated their nationals from Wuhan, the Pakistani government -- despite strong criticism from the opposition -- has declined pleas by several hundred Pakistani students in Wuhan to airlift them.\n",

Various airports in the country have started screening passengers arriving from China for symptoms of coronavirus infection\n.\nNews agency Reuters reported that a senior Indian government official said bringing Indian nationals from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus, was not the best option due to the risk of infection but increased pressure from the citizens, most of them students, and their parents had forced them to keep an aircraft on standby.\nThis week, India readied a state-carrier airplane to travel to Wuhan but was waiting for a nod from Chinese authorities who were trying to sequence the whole evacuation process.\n\"Only those nationals who don't have the virus will be airlifted, they will be brought into a quarantine facility outside Delhi,\" the official said, requesting anonymity.\nDemands from South Asian nationals intensified after countries such as the United States and Japan began pulling out their nationals.\nWHAT IS 2019-NOVEL CORONAVIRUS?\nThe 2019-novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV is a new strain of cornoviruses and has not been previously seen in humans. Cornoviruses form a large family of viruses and the illness they cause can range from common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV).\nThese viruses are zoonotic, which means they are transmitted from animals to humans.\nWhile the exact source (i.e. the animal from which it started) of 2019-nCoV is yet to be identified, other strains of coronoviruses have previously been seen to be transmitted from civet cats to humans (in the case of SARS-CoV) and from dromedary camels to humans (in the case of MERS-CoV).\nThese aren't the only form of coronaviruses. There are many that circulate among animals but have not yet infected humans.\nWHAT CAN 2019-nCoV DO?\nSince this is the first time 2019-nCoV is reported to have infected humans, there is limited information on the exact range of illness the virus can cause. Its effects can range from cough and fever to kidney failure and even death\n.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed the following common signs observed in people infected by 2019-novel coronavirus:\nPRECAUTIONS YOU MUST TAKE\nMuch remains to be known about how exactly the 2019-nCoV infection transmits between humans and animals, and the extent of human-to-human transmissions.\nThe WHO has issued an advisory to reduce risk among those travelling from or to the affected regions.\nAs per WHO, you should observe the following precautions:\n(With inputs from agencies.)\n",

Brent sank 6.3% for the week.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 fell 63 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $50.32 a barrel. The contract lost 2.4% for the week.\nThis week, a panel advising OPEC+, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, suggested provisionally cutting output by 600,000 barrels per day (bpd).\nOn Friday, Russia Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow needed more time to assess the situation.\n“Russia’s lack of commitment thus far to such a deal is providing one additional bearish element that is currently precluding the complex from sustaining price advances,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.\nPrices have fallen about a fifth since the outbreak of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China is the world’s biggest importer of crude, taking in roughly 10 million bpd in 2019.\nNovak predicted global oil demand may fall by 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2020 in part because of the virus.\nThe OPEC+ group this year deepened existing cuts to roughly 1.7 million bpd, nearly 2% of global demand, yet prices have remained in a narrow band. Producers in OPEC+ are scheduled to meet in Vienna on March 5-6, although the meeting could be brought forward because of concerns surrounding the virus\n.\nForecaster Eurasia Group said it estimates a contraction in oil demand in China of as much 3 million bpd in the first quarter from 2019 levels.\nU.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said on Friday that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on global energy markets is currently marginal, though it could worsen if the virus spreads.\nSources have told Reuters that Chinese policymakers are preparing measures, including more fiscal spending and interest rate cuts, amid expectations that the outbreak will have a devastating impact on first-quarter growth.\n(GRAPHIC: Change in Brent crude oil prices since Jan. 20 - here)\nU.S. energy firms added oil rigs for the third time in four weeks even though producers planned to continue reducing spending on new drilling for a second consecutive year in 2020.

Topics tagged “the Wuhan government owes Doctor Li Wenliang an apology” and “we want free speech” briefly trended on Weibo late on Thursday, but yielded no search results on Friday.\nA selfie of him lying on a hospital bed earlier this week wearing an oxygen respirator and holding up his Chinese identification card was being shared widely.\nLi said on Weibo on Feb. 1 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus.\nReuters has been unable to reach Li’s family.\n“Light a candle and pay tribute to the hero,” said one Weibo commentator. “You were the beam of light in the night.” An image also posted on Weibo showed a message, “farewell Li Wenliang”, carved into the snow on a riverbank in Beijing.\nLi’s case is a tricky one for China’s leadership after Beijing was accused of covering up the full extent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Beijing has called for transparency in the current crisis, and local officials have come in for public blame over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak\n.\n“Wuhan indeed owes Li Wenliang an apology. Wuhan and Hubei officials also owe a solemn apology to the people of Hubei and this country,” Hu Xijin, the editor of the ruling Communist Party-backed Global Times tabloid, said in a Weibo post.\nReports of Li’s death surfaced on state media before midnight local time on Thursday in China, were removed, and then reappeared early on Friday.\nThe Wuhan hospital where Li worked said on its Weibo account that he died at 2:58 a.m. local time on Friday.\nChina’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which punishes official corruption, said on Friday it would send investigators to Wuhan to probe “issues raised by the people in connection with Dr. Li Wenliang.” It gave no further details.\n“The CCDI has now sent an investigation team to carry out a full probe in response to public concerns and to allow people to look forward to the revealing of the full truth,” the official People’s Daily wrote in an editorial.\nAt a news conference in Wuhan on Friday, the city’s vice mayor Hu Yabo said he was “deeply grieved” at the death of Li Wenliang and others who have been killed by the virus, and would fully cooperate with the investigation.\nThe World Health Organization said on Twitter that it was “deeply saddened” by news of his death, while China’s National Health Commission and the Wuhan government also issued statements of condolence.\nSome Chinese media outlets described him as a “hero who was willing to speak the truth”, while other commentators posted poems, photos and drawings saluting him.\nOn WeChat, some users posted links to the song from Les Miserables’, “Do You Hear the People Sing?”, which was sung during protest movements in Hong Kong and South Korea. Some people organised an online petition to the State Council making demands such as punishing local Wuhan officials.\nChina has reported more than 630 deaths and 30,000 cases of the coronavirus.\n",

Both planes are due to arrive on Friday.\nThe Defense Department has set aside surplus housing at each of those and a handful of other U.S. bases as quarantine sites for American evacuees arriving from Wuhan or the surrounding province of Hubei, where the coronavirus originated.\nThe first evacuation flight from Wuhan, carrying 195 State Department employees, their family members and other Americans, arrived Jan. 29 at March Air Reserve Base near Los Angeles.\nAnother group of nearly 350 Americans airlifted from Wuhan arrived on Wednesday aboard two cargo jets - 178 of them taken to Travis Air Force Base in northern California and 167 others to Miramar near San Diego.\nFollowing the same procedures of previous flights, the latest wave of evacuees will be met by personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for screening and will be placed under quarantine for 14 days, the extent of the incubation period for the coronavirus, the Pentagon said\n.\nAny who show signs of illness will likely be hospitalized in isolation off base, as have a total of at least six passengers who exhibited fever, cough or other possible symptoms of the disease upon their arrival at Travis and Miramar.\nThe United States and other countries have stepped up efforts to evacuate their citizens from China, where the coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 30,000 people and killed at least 600, most in and around Wuhan.\nThe CDC has said the risk of widespread transmission of the disease in the United States remains very low, but the Trump administration last week declared a U.S. public health emergency to ensure containment of the virus.\nTwelve cases have been confirmed in the United States, none fatal. All but two of the patients were infected while traveling to China. Just two cases are known to have been transmitted person-to-person within the United States - both spouses of individuals who were infected abroad.\nStarting this week, the U.S. government has barred U.S. entry of all foreign nationals who have recently been in China.\nThe CDC also has ordered mandatory two-week quarantine for all U.S. travelers who have visited China’s Hubei Province, while Americans who were elsewhere in mainland China are subject to 14 days of self-quarantine and monitoring.\nAll commercial flights carrying Americans home from China are being directed to one of 11 U.S. international airports, where passengers are screened by the CDC.

He did not say how the United States would need to adjust its expectations.\nThe United States wants China to live up to its pledges, Perdue said, but trade negotiators could not have anticipated the outbreak.\n“There are force majeure type of things ... that I think you have to be sensitive to,” Perdue said.\nThe deal text contains a disaster clause, yet to be formally invoked by Beijing, to allow for delays: “In the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control of the Parties delays a Party from timely complying with its obligations under this Agreement, the Parties shall consult with each other.”\nChina has reported that more than 500 people have died in the outbreak, most in and around the locked-down central city of Wuhan, where the new virus emerged late last year\n.\nChina’s ability to meet its purchase target was in doubt even before coronavirus outbreak, because rival soybean supplier Brazil is harvesting a massive crop, and a deadly pig disease is reducing Chinese demand for soy used to feed livestock.\n“If you will, the coronavirus has given China a get-out-of-jail card on their obligations,” said Bill Lapp, economist and president of Nebraska-based Advanced Economic Solutions.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday the epidemic would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from the trade deal.\n",

According to Reuters, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the United States has set up a new vaccine research group, which plans to carry out human trials on potential vaccines three months later to find out the response to pneumonia in Wuhan. According to the source, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases under the National Institutes of health, said that from gene sequencing to preliminary human trials, it would be as soon as three months.\nAccording to the data, the cause of pneumonia in Wuhan comes from a new coronavirus. China has isolated the virus strain and provided gene sequence information, so that scientific research teams in various countries can immediately start to develop vaccines, the report said. WHO said earlier that the new coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) belonged to the same coronavirus family, and was officially named the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\nAs a result, the past experience of fighting SARS may serve as a mirror for us teams to develop and issue vaccines more quickly, the report said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao signature Yu Zeyuan commented: \"most people did not think a few days ago that the Chinese New Year's coronavirus (commonly known as Wuhan pneumonia) will be shrouded in the rat's Spring Festival. In order to prevent further spread of the epidemic, from January 23, Wuhan City, Hubei Province and surrounding cities such as Ezhou City, Xiantao City, Qianjiang City, Huanggang City, Jingmen City, etc. announced to suspend the operation of urban transportation vehicles, and closed the airport, railway station, highway and other access channels, which is also known as \"Fengcheng\". City closures and strict prevention and control measures not only make the festival atmosphere dignified, but also bring many inconveniences to people's lives. Although the Spring Festival Gala programs of CCTV and other provinces and cities are still singing, people in reality are praying and blessing peace, Xin Qiji, Huo Qubing, Kang Youwei and other historical celebrities have become hot words for new year's Eve. However, few people complain that these prevention and control measures are too harsh; on the contrary, the public is more critical of Wuhan city and Hubei Province for failing to strictly control the epidemic in the first time. \"\n\"More than 5 million people have left Wuhan because of the Spring Festival and the epidemic,\" Zhou Xianwang, mayor of Wuhan, said at a press conference on the evening of the second day of the new year. The news caused a great shock. Where have all about 5000000 people gone? How many of them are carriers of the new coronavirus? How many human infections do they cause? These questions are very worrying indeed. \" \"From the initial situation, Wuhan failed to seal the new coronavirus within the minimum range at the first time. Frankly speaking, our first battle was bad. When we find out a disease, we can't find out which disease we used to be familiar with. It's unique without any record. Secondly, modern medicine has no medicine that can effectively fight against it. There is no way to take it. At this time, we should attach great importance to it and take the most resolute isolation treatment measures. However, Wuhan's actual response measures were obviously slow, without comprehensive isolation treatment and blocking all potential channels of infection, so that the virus spread to the whole country. This is another painful lesson. \"\n\"Wuhan is the transportation hub of the mainland. Ships in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, national high-speed trains and long-distance buses across the province are bound to pass through Wuhan,\" said an editorial signed by Lu Feng in Hong Kong's apple daily. Millions of people flow in and out of Wuhan every day. When a new coronavirus appears in Wuhan and can be passed on from person to person, other cities as far as Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing will soon have cases of infection\n。 But the governments of these cities are as good as nothing. Even when there are confirmed cases in Thailand and Japan, other provinces and cities in the mainland still haven't reported any suspected cases, let alone confirmed cases. In terms of the number and distance of people flow, the number of people flow from Wuhan to Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen must be dozens of times more than that to Japan and Thailand. How can it be that there have been several confirmed cases in foreign countries, while the mainland provinces and cities keep zero infection instead! In addition to the domestic clowns don't want to be passed on, in addition to the provincial and municipal governments pretending to be ignorant, what is the explanation? \"\nThe editorial system of the Chinese World Journal said: \"there is a huge lack of system from top to bottom. On the evening of 20, Xi Jinping delivered a new coronavirus speech in CCTV, requiring all local governments to do well in epidemic prevention and control, and maintain the overall social stability. Before and after his speech, great changes took place in the whole Chinese officialdom; after his speech, Wuhan and all parts of the country announced the number of new virus infections, which increased rapidly every day, shocking the world. But the figures released every day are in sharp contrast to the downplay and concealment of the epidemic by local officials before Xi's speech. \" \"Why is there such a huge gap before and after the speech? Because the central authorities have strict control and carry out the system from top to bottom, any major event must be reported at all levels. The lower officials have no decision-making power. They must report to the higher authorities for approval. The Wuhan Municipal Health Bureau has no right to dare to announce the epidemic situation. They must report to the provincial government. The governor and the provincial Party Secretary will report to the central authorities again and report to Xi Jinping's confidant at last. The confidant took many factors into consideration, figured out what he wanted to do, decided how to report to the study, he did not like to listen to the reports, he only wanted to listen to the top down system and the reporting process at all levels. It was one month after the outbreak of the epidemic that he only reported to Xi Jinping. The delay in decision-making led to the rapid spread of the epidemic\n",

Ministries, departments and government-linked companies are to postpone any invitations for Chinese visitors to the country.Cooperation from airline companies will be acquired to examine the passports of passengers during the check-in for flights to Brunei Darussalam. Anyone found to have been at Hubei province during the past 14 days will not be allowed to board the flight.Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohammad Isham said, “Currently, there are no cases of the coronavirus (2019 n-CoV) infection in Brunei Darussalam.”He also said the Ministry of Education (MoE) has adopted measures with regard to local students who have returned to Brunei Darussalam from China, by urging them to undergo 14 days of self-isolation.Meanwhile, 39 Hengyi staff members who have just returned from China are also undergoing 14 days of self-isolation.Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohammad Isham also revealed that 73 Bruneian students are studying in China, with only 31 students still there. Twenty-nine of the students are expected to return to Brunei Darussalam today. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will try to send the remaining two students back to Brunei Darussalam soon,” he said.Meanwhile Dato Seri Setia Awang Haji Hamzah said, “Students returning from China have been given a leave of absence for two weeks, to monitor their health. This was implemented last week, and was announced to all government, private and international schools.”Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohammad Isham also pointed out that “Brunei Darussalam is currently in the alert phase of this public health event. The risk of importation into Brunei Darussalam is considered high. Brunei Darussalam is operationally ready to deal with the potential for imported cases, using three-pronged approaches, namely: the prevention of imported cases, the early detection of cases through screening at points of entry, laboratory confirmation and clinical alertness, and response to cases through strict control measures such as isolation and quarantine.”He added, “Alhamdulillah, last week, we received the proper kits for identifying the coronavirus here. So we should be able to identify the virus within hours if there are any suspected cases.”On reinforcing screening at all border entry points, he said, “Cruise ships will also have thermal scanning on board, prior to the passengers’ departure. At the land borders, we will use the temperature hand gun, because thermal screening is very sensitive to environmental temperatures and therefore less effective. So we hope to cover all of the entry points.”When asked if there were any plans to restrict visas for Chinese visitors, he said, “With the ease of travelling around the world by flights, we are not restricting visas-on-arrival for Chinese visitors. As many countries have already been affected, our principle is that irrespective of their nationality, anyone from Hubei province or Wuhan will be barred from entering the country. Those who have been in contact with them will also be barred from entering the country.”The MoH will provide updates on the latest development, as well as measures that need to be taken. For information, call the Darussalam hotline at 123, or visit the MoH website at www.moh.gov.bn.\n",

Luckily, I managed to lower it, and my exit went smoothly.\"\nIt's supposed to be one of the women on 24-hour. In January, the new Coronavirus was diagnosed in France, on which WeChat was posted. According to BBC, the woman had previously travelled to Lyon from the city of Wuhan, where the current outbreak began. Shortly after the post, the Chinese embassy in Paris reported to the French authorities. Meanwhile, the woman has been found and is under quarantine.\nThe woman is one of three people affected by the new Coronavirus in France. The French Ministry of Health confirmed this. The other two patients had also been to China before, it was said. What do the cases mean for Europe and Germany? How much do experts already know about the virus? And how is the situation in China developing?\nThe cases are the first in Europe, but they are no surprise. For days, experts have been assuming that the virus is coming to Europe. It is also considered likely that Germany will soon register the first cases brought in. But that's nothing to worry about. One reason for this assessment was that the director of the Robert Koch Institute told the Today Journal of the ZDF that \"outside China (...) so far there are no large chain infections\". And the European Anti-Fraud Office also said on Saturday:'European countries have the capacity to prevent and control an outbreak as soon as cases are discovered'.\nThe ECDC was founded only as a reaction to the Sars pandemic 2002/2003, i.e. as a reaction to a pandemic whose pathogen resembles the new Coronavirus. At that time hundreds of people died worldwide, also Germany registered nine cases\nYeah. In response to the Sars pandemic, most European countries also developed pandemic plans. Germany also has a national pandemic plan, which was last revised 2016. Every two years the pandemic case and the coordination between the federation and countries in exercises is tested.\nAnd so Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, emphasises to ZEIT ONLINE: \"We are very well prepared.\" In Hamburg, for example, the main actors, his institute, health offices and the Eppendorf University Clinic have been in close contact for days. The responsibilities were very clear.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus\nYeah. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment must be\nYeah. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nWhat could also help researchers is to understand the outbreak and the virus better, despite many gaps. The outbreak of the virus probably originated in a market in the 11-million-dollar town of Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, all kinds of wild animals such as snakes, foxes and pheasants are sold. From one of these animals, it could have been passed on to a human. On the other hand, it could have been transmitted by a bat, an analysis of the virus genomes (Biorxiv: Benvenuto et al., 2020) shows. This chain of infections is also unlikely because it resembles the Sars virus closely related to the new Coronavirus.\nHowever, it is now also clear that not all the infected were on the market. At the beginning of December, it appears that a patient has been infected elsewhere. This is shown by the data of Chinese doctors (The Lancet: Huang et al., 2020). Where exactly is unclear. Another animal reservoir or an infection from person to person is possible.\nIn general, it is now certain that the virus is effectively transmitted from person to person. The World Health Organization reported a chain of infections with four limbs, that is: a human infected himself at the animal source, then a second human infected a third, who passed the virus on to a fourth\nYeah. According to very preliminary estimates, an infected person is currently infecting 1,4 to 2,5 people. For comparison: a person who has measles has twelve people on average, a person who has the flu virus, two to three. According to previous knowledge, the new virus is therefore less infectious than the Sars agent. These figures, says the virologist Schmidt-Chanasit, are now rather a \"benchmark\" to assess how the epidemic is developing and what measures it needs.\nMedical practitioners also know more about the course of the virus disease. About a quarter of all cases were very difficult, the WHO said. After a first case report (New England Journal of Medicine: Zhu et al., 2020), The Lancet also published a study on the cases of illness in which data from forty-one patients from a hospital in Wuhan (Huang et al., 2020) were fed. It shows that most patients came to the hospital with fever and cough, one had diarrhoea. All patients had pneumonia detected in the CT scan. On average seven days after the first symptoms, the patients in the study were admitted to the hospital, after eight days their breath was short, and one day later lung failure followed.\nThe study also shows that some patients had heart problems. At every tenth an additional germ in the damaged pulmonary tissue was removed. Of the forty-one patients, six died, so about fifteen percent.\nIn a comment accompanying the study, however, doctors point out that many infected have few or no symptoms. It was therefore more likely that about three percent of the infected would die (The Lancet: Wang et al., 2020)\nYeah. But also this number, writers say, should be enjoyed with caution, because \"not all patients have left their illness behind (i.e., died or recovered) and the true number of patients is unknown.\"\nAccording to official information, around 1.300 people were diagnosed with the virus at the time of the appearance of this article. In order to stop the further spread, the Chinese authorities have taken various measures. They not only try to locate and quarantine contact persons of infected people, but also have a hospital with about 1.000 beds set up on the 3rd. February should be ready. Many experts consider China's response to the virus to be very rapid and praise the transparency of the authorities, especially compared to the Sars epidemic.\nThe Science Media Center in Germany, SMC, is a service for quality assurance in scientific journalism. It is supported by universities, research institutes, companies and the media. Journalists and journalists of the SMC provide free-of-charge information, scientific assessments of studies and quotes of researchers on current news, on topics from medicine and life sciences, the environment and climate, energy and mobility to all editorials.\nThe SMC's partners are the Science Press Conference (WPK) and the Klaus Tschira Foundation in Heidelberg. The SMC was founded in the year 2015 following the British model.\nHowever, there is also criticism of the latest measures: in recent days, China has sealed off entire cities by blocking roads, railway lines and airports in Wuhan and neighbouring major cities. Around 56 million Chinese in 22 cities have been affected by this.\nMany experts do not think this is a good idea\nYeah. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of Global Health at Georgetown University, told the German Science Media Center: \"A containment of Wuhan will drive the epidemic underground and trigger fear and panic.\" In an epidemic, the exact opposite must be done, namely \"gain the trust of the community\". Only in this way would people work together, allowing authorities to track infection chains seamlessly, identify contact persons of infected people and quarantine them, and ultimately contain the epidemic.\nWith information from dpa\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new Coronavirus is spreading with enormous dynamism, despite the countermeasures taken by the Chinese authorities. Throughout the world, researchers try to deduce from the still young development as many characteristics of the organism as possible. What you know and what you don't:\n-CORONAVIREN: The pathogen 2019-nCoV is one of the Coronaviruses, so called because they are surrounded by zackenlike structures that resemble a crown. Seven representatives of this group cause respiratory diseases in humans. Three of these are known to cause some serious symptoms: in the case of Sars virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome) also originating in China, 2002/2003 became known around 8000 cases, around 800 people died. ==References====External links====External links==* Official website It is less contagious, but more aggressive: from around 2500 infected to November 2019, nearly 860- about every third died. 2019-nCoV is very closely related to Sars.\nINFECTIOSITY: It is difficult to assess how infectious the new virus is. The Chinese authorities assume that an infected person infects on average 1,4 to 2,5 people, which would be similar to Sars. \"Such figures are extremely unreliable,\" says the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite. Consequently, the rate of transmission depends on many factors, such as whether people are socially active or stay at home. That is what the measures in China are aimed at. \"I think these measures are doing something.\" It is positive that people usually only become infectious with the symptom, unlike the flu, where people are already infectious before they get sick.\n-AGGRESSIVITY: The new Coronavirus appears to be less aggressive than Sars and Mers. By Monday, 80-year-olds of around 2800-year-old infected died, corresponding to a 2,9-percent mortality rate.\nYeah. However, the number is likely to be misleading, because it is precisely at the beginning of an outbreak that the serious cases become known. Three percent mortality would be very much, in Drostens'opinion. The expert assumes that the ten percent given for sars is also a much too high value. \"There was probably much more than the well-known 8000 Sars cases,\" he explains.\n-SYMPTOME: The incubation period between infection and onset of symptoms is two to 14 days. The lung disease is manifested by fever, dry cough, fatigue and shortness of breath. Because the virus infects the lower respiratory tract, sufferers have no flu. Eventually, the symptoms resemble a Sars infection. No wonder, because the new virus docks at the same receptor. The test on the virus is usually based on sputum (ejection) analysis and lasts about two hours.\nThere is no special treatment for lung disease. Severely ill patients are treated symptomatically: with fever-reducing agents, the treatment of possible additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation.\n-IMPFUNG: Vaccination would be the best way to contain the epidemic. According to Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine, vaccine candidates are currently being tested against Mers in humans. Provided they are successful, they will be available at the earliest in a few months. \"This could then be built on,\" says Schmidt-Chanasit.\n-RESERVOIRE: The reservoirs of various coronavirus are located in the animal kingdom. With Mers, camels are the origin, with Sars and the new pathogen, the reservoirs are probably with bats. The Sars pathogen probably jumped on humans from kittens offered on Chinese markets. Also 2019-nCoV is probably based on an animal market in China. The species of animal from which the virus jumped is currently unknown\nYeah.\nFor protection against this virus as well as other viruses, experts recommend common hygiene measures: regular hand washing, disinfectants and distance to the sick. Schmidt-Chanasit and Drosten consider the usefulness of normal breathing masks, as seen everywhere on the streets today in China, to be rather low.\nPROGNOSEN: Some experts expect a long outbreak. \"We should regard this as a marathon and not a sprint,\" said Chris Whitty, who advises the British Government on health issues. \"The extent and impact of this outbreak is currently unclear because the situation is developing rapidly,\" wrote a team about Anthony Fauci from the US National Health Institutes (NIH) in the specialist journal \"JAMA\". The virologist Drosten, on the other hand, can imagine that the epidemic ends just as quickly as the Sars outbreak, which was quickly flayed and 2004 was declared to have ended. \"I am inclined to think optimistically, because this is a Sars-like disease.\" It is also true that there has so far been little spread outside China. \"This is extremely encouraging.\" Sars continues to train, but only in the animal kingdom.

We cannot let this window of opportunity pass,\"stressed this Tuesday the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Geneva (Switzerland), quoted by the agency France-Presse.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also accused some countries of being \"too late\" in sharing information on cases of contamination of the new viral infection and called for greater international solidarity to combat the outbreak of viral pneumonia.\n\"Of the 176 registered cases so far outside China, the WHO has only received complete 38% notification forms. There are very developed countries that are lagging behind in sharing vital data for the World Health Organisation, and I do not think that this is a lack of capacity,\"he criticised.\nThe Director General of WHO explained that \"without more complete data\", it is \"very difficult\" to evaluate the evolution of the new coronavirus outbreak, and ensure that \"most appropriate recommendations\" are given.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reiterated the organisation's call for countries not to impose flight and trade restrictions, as these decisions can increase \"fear and stigma without significantly improving public health\".\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE: The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that infected more people in China than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 has now spread across the globe. \n While we are learning more about the virus daily, questions are being raised about its rapid spread. One possibility is that this development could be related to climatic conditions. \n CLIMATE, WEATHER AND FLU SEASONALITY \n There is reason to believe that the seasonal pattern of novel coronavirus pneumonia may be similar to that of influenza infection and SARS, and thus cases may sharply fall by May, when temperatures in China warm up. \n In countries with temperate climates such as China and the United States, the flu season usually starts in December with a peak in January or February, after which cases decrease. \n SARS disappeared in the northern summer of 2003 and has not reappeared significantly since. This seasonality of influenza and other respiratory viruses in temperate countries is thought to be related to factors that affect infectiousness (person to person spread) such as the dryness of the air, ambient air temperature and possibly ultraviolet solar radiation. \n Human factors may also contribute to the spread of influenza during the colder winters since more time may be spent indoors, presumably in closer contact with other persons. \n The 2019-nCoV appears to be similar to other respiratory viruses such as influenza or the common cold (rhinovirus), which are spread by large droplets of saliva or phlegm from one person to another (either directly by cough or sneeze) or by contact. That happens when a person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her nose, mouth or eyes, inadvertently transmitting the virus. \n In fact, studies have shown that these respiratory droplets spread farther when the air is cold and dry. \n Studies done many years ago showed that the “regular” coronavirus (which is one of the causes of the common cold) can survive on surfaces 30 times longer in places with a temperature of 6 degrees Celsius compared to those where the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius and humidity levels are high. \n More recently, scientists from Hong Kong University (HKU) including Professor Malik Peiris and Professor Seto Wing Hong showed that low temperatures and low relative humidity allowed the SARS virus to survive much longer than they would in high temperatures and humidity. \n  \n The HKU team argued that this may be the reason warm and humid Southeast Asian countries did not have SARS outbreaks, unlike Hong Kong and Singapore where in their words, there is “intensive use of air-conditioning”. \n Thus, just as with influenza, the 2019-nCoV may slow down when the sun starts to shine more and the weather warms up in temperate and subtropical countries. \n LESSONS FROM SARS \n The SARS epidemic occurred 17 years ago and, since then, public health institutions, medical and laboratory science professionals, and the infectious diseases community are much better prepared to respond to novel and emerging infections globally. \n The improvements in communications and social media are undeniable. The genetic sequence of this new type of severe pneumonia in Wuhan was shared relatively early. \n This allowed countries all over the world to develop fast and accurate tests: These were not available during the initial weeks of SARS outbreak. \n Then, we had to depend on clinical examinations and contact tracing to determine who really was infected with SARS. Near the end of the epidemic, we were able to test everyone and we found out that we had actually missed a significant number of cases – these were only diagnosed after they had recovered. \n This has been the biggest difference in that now, low-resourced countries like Nepal and Cambodia are able to conduct relatively fast and accurate diagnosis on-site without having to wait for samples to be sent overseas. \n Given that the genetic information about the novel coronavirus was available even before countries had patients with the virus, many labs in advanced countries, including Singapore, are already working on blood tests for rapid detection and studying the immune response to help vaccine development. A trial to test anti-viral treatments has already been initiated in China and is being planned elsewhere. \n CONTACT TRACING AND TRAVEL BANS \n A basic public health approach to any outbreak is the use of contact tracing. \n  \n This means that for any patient who is found to be ill, close family members and other persons that he or she had close contact with during the incubation period will be notified that they were exposed to a sick person and quarantined for a further full incubation period, which for this novel infection is indicated to be 14 days. \n During the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, this type of contact tracing was done very manually in many settings, although there were a number of mobile applications which were piloted. \n For this 2019 virus infection outbreak, much effort is being placed on high-tech contact tracing. It is too early to tell if this will be more effective, but any method to help contacts monitor themselves during the incubation period and detect symptoms may certainly help to decrease community transmission. \n Public health measures including screening and quarantining are similar to what was done for SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), although there have been broader approaches to travellers without direct contact with infected patients because of the extent of community spread in China. \n Given that we are not sure as to what extent asymptomatic persons can transmit the virus, many countries have decided to close their borders to Chinese nationals, as they cannot rely on temperature screening to detect who is potentially contagious and necessitating quarantine. \n Many countries are also quarantining their own citizens and permanent residents returning from China, in an effort to limit introduction of this virus into the community. \n During SARS, the World Health Organization (WHO) imposed global travel restrictions and advisories. When a travel restriction is in effect, a country may feel the need to quickly get the ban lifted and reduce its aggressive screening and case finding. This may have contributed to the resurgence of SARS in Toronto after the initial period of good control. \n This time round, different countries have introduced their own travel restrictions which are probably more appropriate to the different situations and their relations with China. \n Travel bans are always controversial as they tend to have significant unintended consequences and have to be actually instituted before the virus appears in the country. Otherwise, they are relatively pointless. \n Among the concerns about the travel bans instituted this time during the coronavirus is the fact that we do not know how extensive the spread is from people without symptoms. \n  \n If this is really very widespread, then a blanket travel ban will have limited effects by now as the virus is probably silently spreading among and through most countries. Once there is documented local transmission in a country, as in Germany and the United States, the goal has to be containing the local transmission while at the same time preventing re-introduction of the virus. \n Overall, the key strategy has to be good contact tracing and widespread testing so that every case can be identified, tested and treated. That way the chain of transmission can be broken and the virus stopped in its tracks even before the warm weather kicks in. \n VACCINES AND DRUG TREATMENTS \n Unfortunately, the current way in which drug and vaccine development in modern medicine happens is very much driven by financial considerations. Unlike for example defence or homeland security, the question that always comes up when it comes to treating and preventing human disease is: “Is this financially viable?” \n As SARS disappeared 17 years ago and MERS has only occurred sporadically, primarily in the Middle East, there has been no incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to invest the funds needed to develop appropriate drugs and vaccines. \n All the interest and enthusiasm which came with SARS disappeared when the virus did not reappear after a couple of seasons. Governments had other priorities and most have actually left this part of national security to private industry. \n Hence, if and when the novel coronavirus disappears in May and does not reappear next October or November, we can predict that drug and vaccine development will likely die a natural death. \n That is unfortunately the way of the world and hopefully something can be done to change this. But that will require a massive global mindset change. Given the frequency with which these emerging viral infections occur, the world can ill- afford to continue along this road. \n Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the Wuhan virus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram \n Assistant Professor Jyoti Somani, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and Professor Paul Ananth Tambyah, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, NUS and President, Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. \n Editor's Note: A previous headline to this commentary referred to hot and dry climate.

        "news_content_translate_en": "ANN ARBOR, Michigan: Work has begun at multiple organisations, including the United States’ National Institutes of Health, to develop a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, known among scientists as 2019-nCoV. \n Scientists are just getting started, but their vaccine development strategy will benefit both from work that has been done on closely related viruses, as well as advances that have been made in vaccine technologies. \n For instance, nucleic acid vaccines, which are DNA- and RNA-based vaccines, can produce the vaccine antigen in the patient’s own body. \n DEVELOPING VACCINES FOR VIRUSES \n While scientists have not been working on a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus prior to the outbreak, work has been ongoing for other closely related coronaviruses that have caused severe disease in humans, namely MERS and SARS. \n Scientists had not been concerned about this particular strain, as they did not know that it existed and could cause disease in humans until the outbreak. \n Work on vaccines for severe coronaviruses has historically begun once the viruses start infecting humans. \n Developing a vaccine involves designing the vaccine constructs – for example, producing the right target antigens, viral proteins that are targeted by the immune system, followed by testing in animal models to show that they are protective and safe. \n Once safety and efficacy are established, vaccines can advance into clinical trials in humans. If the vaccines induce the expected immune response and protection and are found safe, they can be mass produced for vaccination of the population. \n WHAT MORE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A VACCINE \n Currently, we lack virus isolates – or samples of the virus – to test the vaccines against. We also lack antibodies to make sure the vaccine is in good shape. \n  \n We need the virus in order to test if the immune response induced by the vaccine works. \n We would also have to establish what animals to test the vaccine on. That potentially could include mice and nonhuman primates. Vaccine development will also likely take months. \n DEALING WITH FUTURE OUTBREAKS \n We expect that these types of outbreaks will occur for the foreseeable future in irregular intervals. \n To try to prevent large outbreaks and pandemics, we need to improve surveillance in both humans and animals worldwide as well as invest in risk assessment, allowing scientists to evaluate the potential threat of detected viruses. \n Given that this is the third major outbreak of a new coronavirus that we have had in the past two decades and the severity of the resulting diseases such as MERS and SARS, we should consider investing in the development of a vaccine that would be broadly protective against these viruses. \n We believe that global action is needed to invest in novel vaccine approaches that can be employed quickly whenever a new virus like the current coronavirus – and also viruses similar to Zika, Ebola or influenza – emerges. \n Currently, responses to emerging pathogens are mostly reactive, meaning they start after the outbreak happens. We need a more proactive approach supported by continuous funding. \n Aubree Gordon is Professor of Public Health at the University of Michigan.

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Repeats Feb 11 story with no changes in text)\nBEIJING, Feb 11 (Reuters) - China’s coronavirus outbreak has tested the limits of free speech on the country’s heavily censored online and social media, with a brief window of liberalization that opened during January subsequently slammed shut by authorities.\nWhile censorship in China has tightened under President Xi Jinping, questions of transparency around the current outbreak are especially sensitive after Beijing’s cover-up of the extent of the 2003 SARS epidemic fuelled suspicion and mistrust, and led to official calls for openness this time around.\nThe period from Jan 19 to Feb 1, when public concern about the coronavirus exploded just as China was gearing up for the Lunar New Year holiday, saw an uncharacteristic loosening. Online buzz about the outbreak flourished, with netizens largely unfettered in criticizing local authorities - but not central government leaders - over their handling of the crisis.\nThat liberalisation has come to end, with censors in the past week shutting down WeChat groups and scrubbing social media posts, according to Chinese reporters. Authorities have also reprimanded tech firms that gave free rein to online speech.\n“Xi Jinping has made it clear that he expects efforts to strengthen ‘the guidance of public opinion’ to be increased,” said Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) who studies Chinese social media.\n“We’ve already seen around 300 more journalists dispatched to Wuhan and surrounding areas to report on the outbreak. It’s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government’s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.”\nThe cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), did not respond to phone calls or to requests for comment sent by fax.\nChina’s censorship machine was tested last week when Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who had been reprimanded for issuing an early warning about coronavirus, died of the disease, triggering widespread outrage as well as mourning.\nOnline media outlets were permitted to report on Li’s death, but not the anger it had engendered, and early discussions on social media calling for the Wuhan government to apologise to him later disappeared.\nA notice sent to editors working for an online Chinese news outlet and seen by Reuters asked them not to “comment or speculate” on Li’s death, “do not hashtag and let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.”\nSarah Cook, the China media bulletin director at Freedom House, said that previous crises had also seen brief windows of openness, such as the deadly 2011 crash of a high-speed train and the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, when domestic journalists and social media users felt emboldened.\n“At the same time, initially, officials might be a bit flat-footed and distracted dealing with an unexpected crisis so things slip through the cracks. Even censors within some social media companies may be sympathetic to some of the content and let it through,” she said.\nThe brief window of media freedom came after officials in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, admitted that it was much worse than anticipated and were heavily criticised for their move in January to reprimand eight people for “spreading rumours” on the emergence of the virus - one of whom was Li.\nLast week, however, CAC announced that it had punished some websites, mobile applications and social media accounts for publishing illicit content on the outbreak, saying it wanted to foster a “good online atmosphere” amid the country’s efforts to contain the epidemic.\nA notice circulated by CAC last week that was seen by Reuters asked audio and video platforms to step up control on “harmful information and rumour” related to Wuhan virus.\nIt also asked them to stick to official media such as Xinhua and People’s Daily, “not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.”\nSome investigative articles published by local media outlets from Wuhan have also been deleted.\nChen Qiushi, a citizen journalist who was sending dispatches from Wuhan over Twitter - which is blocked in China - including images of corpses in the city’s hospitals, has been forcibly put under quarantine since Friday, according to his family and a friend managing his account in his absence.\nMany Chinese Internet users have turned to black humour or shared images, songs and other art forms in private WeChat groups to express their dismay. One phrase widely shared mocked how many Internet pages and content were now showing “server not found” or “404”.\n“404+404+404+404+404=2020,” said the shared post.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Growing insecurity over the coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic in China may have a sharp impact on India's already-strained economy as industries fear that the outbreak could cripple their production activities.\nA recent report by Ind-RA said efforts to contain the virus outbreak within next three to four months will be critical as it would determine the fate of many industries around the globe, including in India.\nIf the virus is contained within the aforesaid time period, the impact on businesses in India and elsewhere will not be overgenerous, the report said.\nBut if no positive result comes within a few months, multiple Indian sectors could face major supply-side disturbances, triggering a delay in key manufacturing activities.\nThe Ind-Ra report goes on to highlight that the economic impact could be worse than what was seen during the SARS outbreak in 2003. At that time, the world was less dependent on China, now considered the biggest world's biggest manufacturing hub with a substantial contribution to the global GDP.\nChina now contributes to over one-sixth or over 15 per cent of the world's GDP and any deceleration in manufacturing activity could significantly impact worldwide growth.\nCommenting on the situation, Sunil Damania, CIO, MarketsMojo.com, said, \"For some reason, if China is unable to control it for six months, the impacts would be severe.\"\n\"It's very difficult to quantify as there are many moving parts. But it would have a significant impact and has the potential to drag down the world's GDP growth rate by at least 20 basis points for CY2020,\" he added.\nIMPACT ON INDIA\nThe Indian economy is already battling many headwinds including inflation, slow demand, and lower-income, which resulted in a sharp fall in GDP growth in 2019. Economic woes could amplify as many of the country's key sectors rely heavily on components or parts manufactured in China.\nWhile the government predicted India's growth for the next fiscal at 6.5 per cent, delay in supply of key essential commodities from China for a prolonged period could spill water on that optimistic forecast.\nSome sectors such as automobiles, consumer electronics, drugs and pharmaceuticals -- all of which contribute significantly to the country's GDP -- will bear the brunt of the supply curbs. Interlinked sectors will also suffer as a result.\n\"If the outbreak continues for longer than anticipated then the risk will not be restricted to a few sectors, but it can hurt the overall economy,\" Damania said.\nOver the past few weeks, concerned voices from the industry have discussed the issue in detail.\nSome industry experts said trade has already been mildly affected in India as supply chain issues start cropping up. The impact will start showing when firms run out of inventory, they said.\nLOWER JOBS, INFLATION AND MORE\nA delay in the supply of inventory would not only lead to lower production but will also lower sales volume. It could also lead to job cuts and higher inflation.\nFor instance, many electronic goods and phone manufacturers have already started facing the effects of supply slowdown as companies in China failed to restart key manufacturing activities. Major smartphone sellers like Xiaomi hinted at possible rise in prices as supplies of key components are already facing delays.\nA host of Indian smartphone manufacturers, who dearly depend on China for key components, are already indicating that their productions will fall if the supply disruptions continue. It could be a huge blow to India, which is the second-largest smartphone market in the world.\nSome analysts are expecting a drop in production and sales of consumer durables and smartphones while others fear that prices could go up in a situation where there is high demand but lack of supply.\nConsumer durables like television, washing machines and air conditioners -- all of which need critical components manufactured in China -- may also see a drop in sales due to lack of supply.\nWhat's worse is the fact that it could lead to higher inflationary pressure on India as China vendors have hiked prices of critical components amid the shortage. Higher inflation in times of slow growth could be disastrous for India and could severely disrupt plans to revive the economy.\nLike smartphones, automobile manufacturers also import a host of parts and essential components from China. It may be noted that more than 60 per cent of Chinese auto assembly production units have been directly affected by the coronavirus epidemic.\nA Boston Consulting Group report said the impact on the Chinese automobile industry will affect many other countries including India. A Fitch report said India's auto production activity could dip by over 8 per cent in 2020 due to the situation.\n\"China supplies India with between 10-30 per cent of its automotive components and this could be two to three times higher when looking at India's EV segment, which highlights just how exposed India's automobile manufacturing industry is to the slowdown of vehicle Chinese component manufacturing,\" it said.\nBut manufacturers in India have little choice apart from monitoring the situation and hoping for factories in China to fire up their assembly lines. Some Chinese factories reopened this week, but workers are in no position to resume activities with no solution in sight.\nAnother concern that India could face due to the virus outbreak in China is job cuts. With lower scope of production activities, some companies will be forced to lay off contractual labourers.\nThis could have a negative effect on India's declining income levels.\nLower manufacturing and production activity due to the virus outbreak could pull down India's Industrial output, which is also not in good shape. To sum it up, a fall in manufacturing output along with ticking inflation and supply constraints could worsen India's growth outlook further.\nAt the time of writing this article, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak stood at 1,488 with a sharp jump in the number of confirmed cases at over 65,000.\nThe situation in China remains critical with 121 news deaths on Friday while Japan registered its first death, the third fatality outside China.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "中国对冠状病毒（Covid-19）疫情越来越不安全，可能会对印度本已紧张的经济造成严重影响，因为工业界担心疫情可能会削弱印度的生产活动。\nInd-RA最近的一份报告说，在未来三到四个月内控制病毒爆发的努力将是至关重要的，因为这将决定全球许多行业的命运，包括印度。\n报告说，如果病毒在上述时间内得到控制，对印度和其他地方企业的影响不会太大。\n但如果几个月内没有积极成果，印度多个行业可能会面临供应方面的重大动荡，引发关键制造业活动的延迟。\nInd-Ra的报告进一步强调，经济影响可能比2003年SARS爆发时更严重。当时，世界对中国的依赖程度较低，中国现在被认为是世界上最大的制造业中心，对全球GDP贡献巨大。\n中国目前占全球GDP的六分之一以上或超过15%，制造业活动的任何减速都可能对全球经济增长产生重大影响。\nMarketsMojo.com首席信息官SunilDamania在评论这一情况时说：“由于某种原因，如果中国在6个月内无法控制局势，影响将是严重的。”\n“由于有许多活动部件，很难量化。但这将产生重大影响，并有可能在2020年将全球GDP增长率至少拉低20个基点，”他补充说。\n对印度的影响\n印度经济已经在与通胀、需求放缓和收入下降等诸多不利因素作斗争，这导致2019年GDP增速大幅下降。由于中国许多关键行业严重依赖中国制造的零部件，经济困境可能会加剧\n.\n尽管印度政府预测印度下一个财政年度的经济增长率将达到6.5%，但中国关键大宗商品供应长期拖延可能会影响这一乐观预测。\n一些行业，如汽车、消费电子、药品和制药，这些行业都对中国的GDP贡献巨大，将首当其冲地受到供应限制的影响。相互关联的部门也将因此受到影响。\n达曼尼亚说：“如果疫情持续时间超过预期，那么风险将不会局限于少数行业，但可能会损害整体经济。”。\n过去几周，业界关注的声音对这一问题进行了详细讨论。\n一些行业专家表示，随着供应链问题的出现，印度的贸易已经受到轻微影响。他们表示，当企业库存耗尽时，这种影响将开始显现。\n就业机会减少、通货膨胀等\n库存供应的延迟不仅会导致产量下降，而且还会降低销售量。这也可能导致裁员和通胀上升。\n例如，许多电子产品和手机制造商已经开始面临供应放缓的影响，因为中国企业未能重启关键的制造活动。小米等主要智能手机销售商暗示，由于关键零部件的供应已经面临延误，价格可能会上涨。\n许多印度智能手机制造商严重依赖中国生产关键零部件，他们已经表明，如果供应中断继续，他们的生产将下降。这可能对印度造成巨大打击，印度是世界第二大智能手机市场。\n一些分析师预计耐用消费品和智能手机的产销将下降，而另一些分析师则担心，在需求旺盛但供应不足的情况下，价格可能会上涨\n.\n电视、洗衣机和空调等耐用消费品都需要中国制造的关键零部件，但由于供应不足，这些耐用消费品的销量可能也会下降。\n更糟糕的是，这可能导致印度面临更大的通胀压力，因为中国供应商在供应短缺的情况下提高了关键零部件的价格。在经济增长缓慢时期，通胀率上升可能对印度造成灾难性影响，并可能严重扰乱经济复苏计划。\n与智能手机一样，汽车制造商也从中国进口大量零部件。值得注意的是，中国60%以上的汽车总成生产单位受到冠状病毒疫情的直接影响。\n波士顿咨询集团（Boston Consulting Group）的一份报告说，对中国汽车业的影响将影响到包括印度在内的许多其他国家。惠誉（Fitch）的一份报告称，受此影响，印度2020年的汽车生产活动可能下降8%以上。\n“中国向印度供应10%至30%的汽车零部件，从印度电动汽车市场来看，这一比例可能高出2至3倍，这突显出印度汽车制造业对中国汽车零部件制造业放缓的敞口，”该公司表示。\n但是，印度的制造商除了监测形势，希望中国的工厂能启动他们的装配线外，别无选择。一些中国工厂本周重新开工，但工人们在没有解决方案的情况下无法恢复生产。\n由于中国爆发病毒，印度可能面临的另一个担忧是裁员。随着生产活动范围的缩小，一些公司将被迫解雇合同工。\n这可能对印度不断下降的收入水平产生负面影响。\n病毒爆发导致的制造业和生产活动减少可能会拉低印度的工业产出，而印度的工业产出也不是很好\n. 总而言之，制造业产出的下降，以及持续的通货膨胀和供应紧张可能会进一步恶化印度的增长前景。\n在撰写本文时，冠状病毒爆发造成的死亡人数为1488人，确诊病例数量急剧增加，超过65000人。\n中国的局势依然严峻，周五有121人在新闻中死亡，而日本则是第一人死亡，是中国以外的第三人死亡。\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - Hundreds of people began disembarking a quarantined cruise ship off Japan on Wednesday as the death toll from the new coronavirus in mainland China passed 2,000 and the number of new cases in the country fell for a second straight day.\nAround 500 passengers were due to disembark the virus-hit Diamond Princess docked at Yokohama near Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK said, ending an ordeal that began when the ship was quarantined on Feb. 3 after a former passenger was diagnosed with the virus in Hong Kong.\nThere were also more promising signs out of China, where the National Health Commission reported the lowest daily rise in new infections since Jan. 29, or 1,749 new confirmed cases. Hubei province - the epicenter of the outbreak - reported the lowest number of new infections since Feb. 11.\nThe latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 and the total death toll to 2,004, three quarters of which have occurred in the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan. Six people have died outside mainland China, including a new fatality announced on Wednesday in Hong Kong.\nThe biggest concentration of infections outside of China was aboard the Carnival Corp-owned Diamond Princess, with more than 540 people infected out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board when the quarantine was imposed.\nThe United States has already flown back over 300 American evacuees from the ship and other countries are queuing up to collect their citizens, including an Australian flight due to arrive in Japan later on Wednesday.\n“We were lucky. We booked a room with a balcony and a lounge area, but after being confined to this cabin – I am very keen to get off this ship,” Australian passenger Vicki Presland told Reuters.\nOnly passengers who had tested negative for the virus and did not show symptoms during quarantine period would be allowed to leave the ship. Those who tested negative but were in cabins with infected people would remain on board for additional quarantine, Japanese officials said.\nJapanese officials defended the decision to quarantine the ship and test people on board.\n“Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital,” NHK quoted Health Minister Katsunobu Kato as saying.\nOn top of steps already taken to isolate Hubei, where the flu-like virus originated late last year in a market illegally selling wildlife, state media reported the province was stepping up efforts to track down anyone with fever.\nThe province will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan. 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications at both brick-and-mortar and online drug stores, Xinhua reported.\nSeveral Chinese cities have declared that a shortage in blood supply for clinical use was imminent, state media reported on Tuesday, as travel curbs keep potential donors at home.\nChinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence that strict measures are working to bring the virus under control, but global health officials say it is too early to predict how the epidemic will play out.\nThe number of new cases in mainland China excluding Hubei has now fallen for 15 straight days. The number of new infections ex-Hubei totaled 56 on Feb. 18, down from a peak of 890 on Feb 3.\nThe head of a leading hospital in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to have succumbed to the disease, known as COVID-19.\nThe World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies program chief, Mike Ryan, said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday were monitored.\nRyan also said there were no indications the new coronavirus was infecting people in North Korea. Some South Korean media outlets have reported multiple cases and possible deaths in the secretive North.\nChina’s ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday the economic impact of the disease would be “limited, short-term and manageable”.\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020, despite some economic analysts downgrading their China forecasts.\nEven so, China’s economy was struggling, with many factories closed and others still not at full production after the extended New Year break, disrupting global supply chains and firms like U.S. tech giant Apple and major automakers.\nBritain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.\nData this week from Japan and Singapore indicated those economies are on the brink of recession, while South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his country’s economy is in an emergency situation.\nEconomists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.\nAnalysts at Nomura estimated 70% of workers who went home for holidays have yet to return to cities to work and that the business resumption rate was less than 40%.\nForeign pilots at some Chinese airlines have returned to their home countries and are considering other jobs after being placed on unpaid leave as demand falls, affected flight crew told Reuters. [L4N2A60YP]\nData firm OAG estimates about 80% of scheduled airline capacity to, from and within China has been cut this week because of the epidemic.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nIndia has despatched a C-17 Globesmart, the largest military aircraft in its fleet, to bring back on Friday the remaining 100 or so Indians left in Wuhan. Air India has already evacuated more than 600 Indians from the city.\nAt present we don't know what time the flight is coming. The only thing we know is that we are going to leave Wuhan tomorrow. We are only hoping that we come back to India soon.\nAll the buildings around my home are sealed. In fact, a university hostel close to my building has been converted into an isolation ward.\nMy Chinese neighbours are helping me to get food and drinking water.\nI have not spoken face to face with anyone since January 22. There are only nine of us in our building and they all are Chinese.\nLike us, they also stay indoors all the time. The fear is so palpable that no one steps out and talks to one another. Each of us thinks the other is positive for coronavirus.\nThe Chinese government hasn't ordered people not to interact, but the atmosphere of fear lingers heavily all over.\nThe Chinese authorities have asked people not to walk in groups and try to remain solitary.\nThe person who delivers food to us messages on the WeChat app and then at a decided time he drops food at the main gate of our building. We are not allowed to go and pick up the food immediately. After the delivery boy leaves, we are allowed to leave our flat after 30 minutes and pick up our order. This is a rule that everyone has to follow in the university campus.\nThe delivery boy fears we might have coronavirus and we, on the other hand, fear that the delivery boy must be carrying coronavirus so it is a cycle of fear where everyone fears each other. We are keeping a distance from everyone.\nOn January 24, I tried to walk around our campus. I saw a man walking towards me, but suddenly he changed direction, fearing he would contract the virus.\nI don't know how far things have improved in Wuhan. Yesterday, one Chinese news article stated that water in our pipes might be contaminated with coronavirus. I have no idea whether this is true or not. And therefore we have stopped using tap water too. We used to boil tap water and drink, but now we depend on bottled water.\nI have stopped watching the news because I get more worried after watching the news. I don't feel like working too. And even if I call my family back home, how long can I talk?\nI keep fearing the worst every time I feel feverish or sneeze leading to many sleepless nights.\nIf that wasn't enough, when you go to any store to buy medicines for fever, the employees inform the doctors and you are forced to go to hospital for a check-up.\nEarlier, they would check our body temperature every two hours to find out whether I have contracted coronavirus or not; that routine changed to one day a week and now they have stopped that.\nI believe we are in the safe zone now.\nRumour mongering regarding coronavirus is very rampant.\nSome say inhaling dust particles could lead to being tested positive, forcing many to shut their windows. However, how long can one stay in an air-conditioned room?\nWe cannot even dry our clothes as we have to keep all our wet clothes inside the room because we now fear coronavirus might enter through air.\nThe Chinese government is cracking down on people who are spreading rumours and till date 15,000 people have been arrested. The government is trying its best to control rumours, but they refuse to die.\nAnother rumour was that garlic water was a cure for coronavirus. The other was that if one drank whiskey or wine you wouldn't be affected by the virus. This resulted in a rise in sale of whiskey and wine. Soon, there was no whiskey and wine was available in Wuhan.\nI had a miscarriage and returned home on January 22. On that very day, the entire city of Wuhan was shut down.\nI am thankful that I came back on January 22 or else I would have been confined to a hospital which would have been worse.\nThe worst day for me was when the doctors came to our home to check whether we were infected with coronavirus or not. There were 10 of them, all dressed up like astronauts.\nI cried and cried because I felt if I am found positive for coronavirus I would die in China and never see my country again.\nLuckily, I was not positive. And rumours spread so fast on the university campus that we were detected with coronavirus which was untrue.\nThe only way to spend our time is the WeChat group all the Indians staying in Wuhan have formed. We have become friends as we are all in the same boat.\nEvery day we feel the Air India flight will come, but it has not come yet.\nWe have run out of food and we don't have flour. We are only eating rice. There is no bread, butter or jam too.\nWe have stopped eating breakfast and eat lunch at 11 am. In fact, we have stopped enjoying meals and only want to come back to India.\nMy family is worried as they know that the isolation ward has come very close to our home; it is only 20 metres away from our home and it is just a crossing away.\nOur government is trying its best to bring us back.\nWe were told yesterday that we have to keep our belongings packed and ready as the plane could come anytime from India.\nNow we are waiting for that official phone call from the Indian embassy that will finally say that the flight has landed, and to come back home.\n",

Delta will also reduce to five times weekly its services between Seoul and Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle through April 30. In total, Delta is shrinking its typical 35 U.S. weekly flights to Korea to 15.\nThe airline’s new service from Seoul-Incheon to Manila, previously scheduled to begin on March 29, will now start on May 1.\nSouth Korea has the most virus cases outside China andreported 334 new cases on Thursday for a total of 1,595.

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus death toll climbed to seven in Italy on Monday and several Middle East countries were dealing with their first infections, sending markets into a tailspin over fears of a global pandemic even as China eased curbs with no new cases reported in Beijing and other cities.\nWhile health experts have expected limited outbreaks beyond China, the rapid acceleration of cases in Italy going from three on Friday to 220 on Monday is concerning, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.\nJust as China put cities on lockdown, Italian authorities sealed off the worst-affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases.\nShops are shut, bars are closed and people speak to each other from a safe distance in northern Italy.\nMarkets are nervous that Europe could experience disruptions similar to China, where air traffic has been disrupted and global supply chains rattled for everything from medicine to cars to smartphones.\nBut China’s actions, especially in Wuhan - the epicenter of the outbreak - probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, said the head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward, urging the rest of the world to learn the lesson of acting fast.\n“They’re at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in,” he said.\nThe surge of cases outside mainland China triggered sharp falls in global markets as investors fled to safe havens. European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.\nThe Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018. All three indexes closed down more than 3% after notching record highs last week on optimism the coronavirus would not seriously hurt global economies.\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index , jumped to a one-year high.\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word “pandemic” did yet not fit the facts.\n“We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,” he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.\nThe epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, the WHO said.\nDr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies program, told reporters it was still possible to contain the virus and that it might appear each year like the flu.\n“The virus may settle down into an endemic pattern of transmission, into a seasonal pattern of transmission, or it could accelerate into a full-blown global pandemic,” he said in Geneva on Monday. “And at this point, it is not possible to say which of those realities is going to happen.”\nIn the United States, the White House is considering asking lawmakers for emergency funding to ramp up its response to the fast-spreading virus, a White House spokesman and an administration source said on Monday. Politico and the Washington Post had reported the Trump administration may request $1 billion.\nLiang Wannian of China’s National Health Commission said while the rapid rise had been halted, the situation was still grim. He said over 3,000 medical staff had become infected, most in Hubei province surrounding Wuhan, probably due to the lack of protective gear and fatigue.\nExcluding Hubei, mainland China reported 11 new cases, the lowest since the national health authority started publishing nationwide daily figures on Jan. 20.\nOverall, China reported 409 new cases on the mainland, down from 648 a day earlier. That took the total number of cases to 77,150, while the death toll rose by 150 to 2,592.\nThere was a measure of relief for the world’s second-largest economy as more than 20 province-level jurisdictions, including Beijing and Shanghai, reported zero new infections.\nOutside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to some 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.\nSouth Korea reported 231 new cases, taking its total to 833. Many are in its fourth-largest city, Daegu, which became more isolated with Asiana Airlines (020560.KS) and Korean Air (003490.KS) suspending flights there until next month.\nKuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran, where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected. Most of the Iran  infections were in the Shi’ite Muslim holy city of Qom.\nA WHO team is due in Iran on Tuesday.\nJapan had 773 cases as of late Sunday, mostly on the cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo.\nIn South Korea, drone footage here showed what appeared to be hundreds of people queuing up outside a Daegu supermarket to buy face masks.\n(Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus here)\n",

We are moving towards controlling the virus,\" he said.\nThe United States, however, expressed concern that Iran may have \"suppressed vital details\" about the outbreak.\n\"All nations including Iran should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organisations,\" said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nIran, which has shut schools, universities and cultural centres until the end of the week, has yet to find the source of the country's outbreak.\nBut the health minister, Saeed Namaki, has said that one person who died of coronavirus in Qom was a businessman who had made several trips to China.\nA World Health Organization spokesman told AFP that a mission to Iran was \"still being planned\" but \"it is not happening today\".\n",

IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nLower air traffic growth projections prompted Spanish travel technology firm Amadeus (AMA.MC) to forecast slower 2020 core profit growth on Friday, but it stressed the outlook did not yet account for the uncertain impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nTo deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM (AIRF.PA) which have announced similar plans.\nIt also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.\nAirline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a stock market rout this week as coronavirus fears have gripped investors. At 0845 GMT, IAG shares were down 8% at 474.59 pence, while easyJet (EZJ.L) stock was down 3% at 1,075 pence and Finnair (FIA1S.HE) was off 3.4% at 4.922 euros.\n(Graphic: Europe's Airlines - here)\nBudget carrier EasyJet reported a “significant” softening of demand into and out of its bases in northern Italy - the center of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in Europe - and a reduction across its other European markets.\nIt also said it would be cancelling some flights, particularly into and out of Italy, and that it would make cost savings across its business, without giving details.\n“We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,” it said, adding it was too early to determine the impact on its results.\nFinnair, meanwhile, warned of a “significant” fall in operating profit this year due to virus-related disruption.\nFinland’s national airline also said its was scrapping its 2020 capacity growth target, and would look into cutting costs by 40-50 million euros ($44-54 million), with measures under consideration including temporary layoffs.\n",

She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s,\" Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\"Additional cases in the United States are likely, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover. If you are healthy, you will probably go through a process and you will be fine,\" he said and urged people not to panic.\nAs many as 15 people have recovered from the virus so far in the US.\n\"There is no reason to panic at all. Our country is prepared for any circumstance,\" the President said at his second press conference in the White House briefing room on his return from India on Wednesday.\nJoining the press conference, Vice President Mike Pence said Trump had authorised a ban on entry of foreign nationals who travelled to Iran in the last 14 days.\nThe United States also advised its citizens not to travel to parts of South Korea and Italy, from where reports of coronavirus have appeared.\nThe vice president has been tasked by Trump to lead the administration's efforts in the fight against the coronavirus.\nAccording to Center for Disease Control Director Robert Redfield, 22 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the US so far.\nTrump said various wings of the US government were working on the coronavirus round the clock.\n\"It is a tough one, but a lot of progress has been made,\" the President said, adding that his administration had taken the most aggressive action in modern history to confront the disease.\nIn a statement, Washington State Governor Jay Inslee announced the death of an individual from the coronavirus.\n\"It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to their family and friends. We will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus,\" he said.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said there was an outbreak of a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus that was first detected in the Wuhan city of China's Hubei province and has now been detected in 50 locations internationally, including cases in the United States.\nIt said the potential public health threat posed by the coronavirus was high, both globally and to the US, adding that to effectively respond to the coronavirus outbreak, rapid detection of cases and contacts, appropriate clinical management and infection control, and implementation of community mitigation efforts were critical.\nThis could best be achieved with wide availability of testing capabilities in healthcare settings, reference and commercial laboratories, and at the point of care, the FDA said.\nIt added that it would allow some 300 to 400 academic-hospital laboratories to begin testing for the virus, allowing for checks of thousands of people rather than the few hundred already tested.\n\"We believe this policy strikes the right balance during this public health emergency.\n\"We will continue to help to ensure sound science prior to clinical testing and follow-up with the critical independent review from the FDA, while quickly expanding testing capabilities in the US. We are not changing our standards for issuing Emergency Use Authorisations.\n\"This action today reflects our commitment to addressing critical public health needs and rapidly responding and adapting to this dynamic and evolving situation,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen M Hahn said.\nThe FDA guidance provides recommendations for test developers, including information regarding test validation, FDA notifications and interim confirmatory clinical testing.\nResponding to a question, Trump said he was considering closing the southern border to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\"We are looking also at (the) southern border. We have received a lot of power on the southern border over the last couple years from the courts, but we are looking at that very strongly,\" he said.\nIn a letter on Friday, several senators, including Ted Cruz, Martha McSally and John Cornyn, called for closing the coronavirus.\n\"As southern border Senators, we are concerned about the possible spread of the coronavirus across our borders,\" they said in the letter to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan.\n\"We are similarly concerned about recent reports that the virus is spreading in Europe. Border shortcomings by the European Union have resulted in the spread of the virus across a number of nations, and it is essential that the United States not repeat these mistakes.\n\"We write to ask how your agency is prepared to address the threat presented by the coronavirus at US borders,\" the senators said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health issues became the United States’ first fatality from the coronavirus, officials said on Saturday, as the Trump administration stepped up efforts to combat the spread of the global outbreak.\nThe patient, who was chronically ill prior to contracting COVID-19, died at EvergreenHealth Hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington health department’s communicable disease unit.\nThe state has recorded two other “presumptive” coronavirus cases at a long-term care facility in Kirkland where more than 50 residents and staff could be showing symptoms, he said.\n“At this point we do not have widespread community-wide transmission locally. We have transmission that’s associated with an outbreak at this long-term care facility,” Duchin said.\nThe two cases at the Kirkland facility were a health care worker in her 40s who is in satisfactory condition, and a woman in her 70s who lived there and is in serious condition.\n“It is a sad day as we learn a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,” the state’s governor, Jay Inslee, said in a statement. “We are strengthening our preparedness and response efforts to keep Washingtonians healthy, safe and informed.”\nThe first U.S. coronavirus death capped a week of stock market upheaval and escalating concern among state and federal health officials as the virus has spread across 46 countries and infected more than 60 people in the United States.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said lawmakers would take up a coronavirus spending bill next week “to advance a strong emergency funding supplemental package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis”.\nMost of the U.S. cases have occurred in travelers who were repatriated from China, where the virus originated.\nBut public health officials have also identified coronavirus cases in California, Washington and Oregon with no direct ties to the virus’ source in China, signaling a turning point in strategies needed to contain the disease in the United States.\nU.S. health authorities say it means the respiratory disease that has infected nearly 80,000 people worldwide and killed more than 2,800 in China is no longer an imported phenomenon but has taken up residence in the United States.\nGRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus - here\n“We still judge the general risk to the American public to be low and that includes residents of long-term care facilities,” Nancy Messonier, head of the Immunization and Respiratory Disease division at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), told reporters in a call on Saturday.\nMessonnier said the agency would send teams to support investigations in California and Washington into how patients contracted the virus and help trace who else may have been exposed.\nReuters graphics on the new coronavirus: here\nPERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted just 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the supposed epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nHealth officials said the advent of locally transmitted infections means authorities need to expand their focus from detecting a relatively limited number of cases, identifying close contacts and isolating them, to one that also emphasizes greater prevention among the public at large.\nIn particular, individuals should be more vigilant about basic hygiene measures, such as washing hands often, avoiding touching their faces, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home from school or work whenever ill, health officials say.\nCoronavirus is spread primarily through tiny droplets coughed or sneezed directly from an infected person into the face of someone nearby, as opposed to the more contagious “airborne” transmission of a virus like measles, which can remain suspended in enclosed spaces and be breathed in hours after being exhaled by sick individuals, experts say.\nCoronavirus can also survive on surfaces, such as handrails and door knobs, for “a very long period of time,” and be picked up by hand that way, though the virus is “very susceptible” to cleaning products, Dr. Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said on Friday in Santa Clara County.\nStill, “It’s mostly a person-to-person transmission that we are concerned about for our communities,” he added.\nFor the online coverage of the coronavirus outbreak click, here\n",

The consequences of the measures against the spread of the virus would be a reduction in demand and production losses in many industries, he said, when presenting the annual figures.\nBASF expects negative effects especially in the first and second quarters. \"I warn against giving premature revelation just because the numbers of patients in China are falling,\" said Brudermuller. It does not expect the Coronavirus effects to be fully offset over the year.\nFor the entire 2020-year, the head of the company expects the world economy to grow at two percent slower than 2019. It also expects significantly lower growth rates for global chemistry. \"This would be by far the lowest growth since the financial crisis 2008/2009,\" Brudermuller added.\n\"If I had to overwrite this, I would throw our team: Kneel! \"said the head of BASF. \"We are now simply making our strategy, which is the right one. We can't change the environment. But we can make the best of it.\"\nDue to the uncertain consequences of the Coronavirus, BASF has indicated a large range for the annual targets, \"This shows the uncertainty\". Revenue is expected to rise 2020 to 60 billion euro to 63 billion euro, after 59,3 billion euro last year. For the adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (Ebit), the company measures 4,2 billion euro to 4,8 billion euro after a decrease of 28 percent to 4,5 billion euro 201Yeah.\nFor 2019, BASF wants to spend a little more money on the shareholders than expected. The dividend is to be increased by ten cents to 3.30 euros per share. The profit after taxes and minorities increased 2019 by nearly 80 percent to eight,4 billion euros in the annual comparison. Here, however, was a book profit from the decolonization of the oil and guest daughter Wintershall, up to around 5.7 billion euros.\n\"2019 was a challenging year with a strong global wind,\" said Brudermuller. The trade disputes between the USA and China had a negative effect and important markets developed more slowly. In addition, there are uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Demand from many important customer industries had fallen significantly, mainly from the automotive industry.\nIn order to make the group more profitable, the brother-miller, who has been in office for almost two years, set up a savings program at the end of 2018. This includes job deletions. BASF accelerated the savings rate, said Brudermuller. Now the dismantling of 6000-digit sites is to be achieved at the end of 2020, one year earlier than planned. In return, BASF plans to invest 23,6 billion euros in the next five years.\nLast year, BASF merged its oil and gas daughter Wintershall with its rival Dea. The company is expected to go public in Frankfurt in the second half of the year. \"We are preparing an IPO,\" said BASF Finance Director Hans-Ulrich Engel. Whether it comes as planned, however, depends on the market conditions.\nThe BASF majority participation of Wintershall Dea is the focus for the construction of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Wintershall Dea is financially involved in the pipeline to transport gas directly from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. The project is a thorn in the United States'side. That is why the companies involved in the pipeline are threatened with sanctions. Construction is currently on icYeah.\n\"Alternatives for completing Nord Stream 2 are being considered,\" said Engel. After the construction stopped, Russia had set in motion a special ship for the laying of gas pipelines. At the moment the stop has no concrete disadvantages for Wintershall Dea, Engel said. The pipeline should be completed by the end of 2020. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The Covid-19 epidemic in China seems to be contained for once. But how does the government intend to stop the economic collapse? What about the credibility of the regime? How does the device work and why did it fail after the virus broke out? These questions and more are answered by Sebastian Heilmann, professor at the University of Trier and former director of the Berlin think tank Merics.\nONLINE TIME: China's government is now gradually lifting the quarantine of Wuhan and Hubei and for a week now the leadership in Beijing has declared that there are no new infections in the country. They just came in from abroad. No more Sars-CoV-2 cases in China after the official confirmation of 800.000 infections since January, can this be?\nSebastian Heilmann: It is a decision of the Politburo that the epidemic is over. Of course, the virus is not gone, but there must be no more negative messages. We have evidence that the epidemic has been contained. However, there is unofficial information that there are still cases in Southwest China that are suspected of Covid-19. The risk of a new infection wave therefore remains concrete for China. What we are seeing now is, above all, a political approach. All unpleasant information is suppressed, and the propaganda apparatus formulates the most important story in the end itself: that the epidemic has been defeated thanks to the superiority of China's system.\nONLINE TIME: A key reason for lifting restrictions in society and the economy is the bad economic climate. The lockdown broke China's economy in the first quarter. How does the Beijing leadership want to tackle the economic crisis? Europe and the USA are the main markets for China because of the virusYeah.\nHeilmann: China's economy, according to what we can sum up from various sources, is again at about 80 percent of its performance. But there is a real catch-up in China. The great unknown is now the demand. We have a global break-in that affects China's exports and supply chains and is hardly countervailable. Domestic demand is also uncertain: are people buying cars or 5G phones again to the extent expected before the crisis? Beijing will now have to save companies with its state banks, especially in the private sector, where liquidity is very tight and with minimal margins. Many small and medium-sized enterprises are on the brink.\nONLINE TIME: Will China spend as much money on this as 2009 did in the financial crisis?\nHeilmann: So far, the Chinese government has been reluctant, in flagrant contrast to the US and the major European economies, which are actually flown with support programmes. China had imposed on 2009 a huge incentive programme of 17% of gross domestic product, which also boosted demand strongly worldwide, but caused serious distortions in investment behaviour in China. Similar programmes have not yet been identified in China. Foreign projects such as the New Silk Road will also have to cope with significantly less funding in the coming years.\nONLINE TIME: Will China invest less abroad in the future?\nNot necessarily. We must expect Chinese investors to make targeted advances against companies and industries that have been closed to them so far. Crisis-related prices would be favourable for investments and acquisitions in Europe. I can imagine that many small and medium-sized businesses in Germany, to whom the economic recession is adding, are quite willing to sell. This is expected to become an increasingly important issue in the coming weeksYeah.\nTIME ONLINE: Party leader Xi Jinping now sends solidarity addresses to other countries, state and companies donate and sell medical supplies abroad, including to Europe, for example in hard-hit Italy. It may be suspected that this is not entirely unhelpful, that Beijing not only wants to improve its geopolitical position towards the Washington government, but is also seeking goodwill so that as many European states as possible, for example, choose to do so, engage latent spy suspect 5G network equipment Huawei. Is that right?\nHeilmann: Beijing is clearly about opening doors in Europe. And let us not delude ourselves: international investment is, of course, welcome in crisis-ridden European economies. China continues to invest heavily in 5G, and from there companies will come to us and say:'We will build you the infrastructure and bring the funding right away'; some governments will not be able to resist.\nTIME ONLINE: Can something be done about the sale of companies?\nHeilmann: The EU and national governments want to prevent a sale out in times of crisis, if necessary through state participation in companies. But I would suggest a more offensive strategy towards Beijing: \"You are helping us now, selling and giving us medical aid, which we appreciate, but we want a moratorium as a confidence-building measure, that, during this crisis phase, no European companies are acquired using Chinese state banks or other state funding models.\"\nI think this is a viable path. The Chinese government will be open to such a proposal, because the rabid acquisition campaigns of American investors in crisis-ridden Asian economies, such as the Asia crisis between 1997 and 1999, are repeatedly criticized harshly in ChinaYeah. Chinese investors do not want to be seen as hedgehogs.\nONLINE TIME: It is a thin line between the resurgence of Covid-19 infections and the stimulation of the economy. How does China intend to strengthen domestic demand?\nHeilmann: With the aim of economic stimulus and social compensation, China's government is expected to introduce generous tax relief up to coupon programs so that even those on low incomes can participate in economic recovery through their consumption. I also believe that targeted purchase subsidies for cars or the badly indebted real estate sector are well possible.\nTIME ONLINE: Is there anything known about widespread dissatisfaction in the population due to the virus crisis?\nHeilmann: Dissatisfaction is regularly articulated in social media. However, as I see it, the monitoring methods have been tightened up and modernised to such an extent that no protest can be organised at the moment. In the course of the fight against the epidemic in China, we see a dramatic increase in the pooled analysis of location data, facial recognition and behavioural profiles. This epidemic has dramatically accelerated the expansion of digital surveillance in China. The control apps developed to combat the epidemic will be introduced in an adapted form in Chinese everyday life.\nONLINE TIME: What is the current status of the regime in the Chinese population?\nHeilmann: Compared to the disastrous epidemic in Italy or the USA, there are now many positive, system-supporting statements. They are generated on the one hand by propaganda, but there is also a lot of spontaneous support. A kind of live system comparison is currently taking place in front of all of us: which country is coping well with the pandemic? Chinese look to South Korea, Japan, also Italy, but especially to the USYeah. They see that the US may not have been able to cope with this epidemic and may be badly damaged economically and politically. And that, paradoxically, China's global status is being promoted by the pandemic, which originated from China but fought successfully there.\nTIME ONLINE: Does the KP leadership also interpret their handling of the epidemic as superiority of the authoritarian one-party system?\nHeilmann: The KP has grown up as a campaign party, it has won the revolution 1949 through mass mobilization and coercion. Since then, the KP has resorted to campaigns in every crisis situation. This kind of emergency mobilization is in the DNA of this party. The party headquarters can switch to crisis mode within a very short period of time, push aside bureaucratic rules and apparatus and drive huge waves of pressure through the entire system that no one can resist. Hard collective disciplinary measures such as the recent outbreak of the epidemic are the natural playing field for the KP.\nTIME ONLINE: There have recently been disinformation campaigns based on official Chinese authorities and partisan media: Suggestions that the virus did not come from Wuhan, that US soldiers had brought it to China or that it came from Italy. Such campaigns against other governments seldom come from Beijing. Why now?\nHeilmann: Chinese disinformation campaigns have been more frequent recently, for example in the Xinjiang question, against Taiwan or Hong Kong, most recently also against Sweden, i.e. smaller political players. But now we are seeing a global campaign aimed at changing the Corona story. China is responsible in two ways from the Western perspective. On the one hand, the initial phase was overslept and early warnings from Chinese doctors were suppressed, which made the pandemic only possibleYeah. And Beijing has allowed hundreds of thousands of Chinese to travel abroad in the last January Ridge. China therefore has a central role and responsibility as the starting point of the pandemic. But this storyline is harmful from the point of view of the Communist Party; it must be changed for the benefit of China.\nONLINE TIME: But the seriousness of the Chinese leadership, at least in Western countries, suffers with the spread of Hanover conspiracy theories.\nHeilmann: China's KP likes to see itself as the guardian of scientific evidence and expertise, especially in contrast to the Trump government, but also in contrast to Russian disinformation and destabilisation campaigns. I therefore think that the KP propaganda will backfire. The conspiracy theory about an American origin of the virus can be interpreted more as a test balloon of foreign policy hawks in Beijing. The party leadership is not aiming for confrontation, but for the country to be willing and helpful internationally in the Corona crisis and not irresponsible and manipulative.\nONLINE TIME: Does China's propaganda actually tell its people the same stories about the origin of the virus?\nHeilmann: Debt assignments to the US, which at the same time deflect responsibility from China, spread quickly in China's social media, because they meet the national pride of many. On the other hand, despite censorship and propaganda, most Chinese are far too clever not to recognize such simple distractions. Many are simply skeptical of official statements about the Coronavirus, because they were personally affected by this epidemic and were able to make their own observations. I expect that the story of a mysterious foreign origin of the virus will therefore not come trueYeah.\nONLINE TIME: The outbreak of the Coronavirus showed that the KP leadership was not informed about everything. The epidemic represents exactly the opposite of what the party stands for: it carries the risk of social unrest and shows that, despite the lessons learned from the Sars crisis 2003, no action was taken on the basis of scientific criteria. How could it have come to this?\nHeilmann: The KP elite in the closed party and government center Zhongnanhai in Beijing employs loyal officials and experts who receive many messages that others will never see and who filter and evaluate them for the KP leadership. These are very serious and highly trained forces, analytically sharp, strategically thinking.\nBut they are by no means risk-averse, which is typical of a highly centralised, authoritarian system such as the Chinese one. The hierarchy of officials has the greatest difficulty in passing on unpleasant or even catastrophic information, which has to be carried from bottom to top of many levels in the KP hierarchy, from the local level to the centre. This system is based on so many information filters that politically undesirable findings make it difficult to get to headquarters in time. We can see from this that freedom of information and freedom of the press is a really good thing.\nONLINE TIME: Will party leader Xi Jinping and his ruling KP rather weaken or emerge stronger from the Corona disaster?\nHeilmann: Unless there are new waves of infection in China and chaotic conditions in the USA, Xi and the KP will definitely emerge from the pandemic. If the American economy and the US dollar are seriously damaged as a result of the pandemic, then China will emerge as a winner from the system comparisoYeah. If that happens, we will then be living on another planet, with completely different political and economic forces than before the pandemic",

About\nThis trend will also be acceptable after other countries gradually emerge from the crisis: there will be few overseas tourists around the world.\nGalliado believes that Europe's troubles will last until mid May, but that doesn't mean people will start travelling immediately. \"\nThis means that people start working from now on. Now, many companies in Spain, for example, companies that stop activities, do not fire their employees, but let them go on vacation.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The spread of covid-19 has reversed the habits of life around the world. Experts cannot say for sure when the epidemic begins to decline, especially when it ends. For the international community as a whole, the main hope remains to provide a Colorado virus vaccine.\nAccording to news reports, American modern biotechnology companies have made progress on this issue. It worked with the National Institutes of health to develop a vaccine prototype called mrna-1273. Human drug trials began in Seattle at the Kaiser Permanent Washington Health Research Institute) in Washington state. In addition, inovio pharmaceuticals is developing its drugs, according to the associated press. Its trials are expected to begin in April in the US, China and South Korea.\nExclusive access\nDespite the success of American experts, the Die Welt newspaper reported earlier this week that, U.S. President Donald Tampa's government has proposed a large \"exclusive license for a possible Colorado virus vaccine from the German company curevac\".\nLast week, Daniel menekela, general manager of curevac, was in the White House with representatives of other pharmaceutical companiesAbout The meeting discussed the issue of Colorado virus vaccines and with irregular organizations, vice president Mike Pence and members of the president's disease control team. As the company's press release points out, meningitis tells U.S. officials that experimental drugs will begin to be ready in the summer.\nAccording to welt, Washington called on cuevac to move its research team to the United States to develop vaccines only for the United States. \" The German Ministry of health confirmed the attempt by the US authorities to take over the company.\nThe news caused outrage among German politicians, who asked Berlin to do everything possible to stop Washington's plans. \"This article is not true,\" U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Greiner wrote on twitter Another US official said the news was \"greatly exaggerated\" and rejected the possibility that any public vaccine could only be used in the US. Curevac itself denies any rumours of absorption.\n\"All efforts are aimed at developing a Colorado virus vaccine to help and protect people and patients around the world.\" It was later learned that the activities of cuevac would be funded by the European CommissioAbout\nGlobal efforts\nAfter Chinese experts were able to isolate the genetic code of the virus, countries around the world began to develop vaccines. Researchers from the European Union, the United States, Australia, Israel, China, Japan and Russia are trying to find a way to fight covid-19. About 35 companies and academic institutions are developing drugs. Four of them have started animal experiments. Recently, clinical research has been allowed in China. It has previously been reported that eight new coronavirus vaccines have been developed in the country, some of which have been successfully tested in transgenic mice and mccack.\nThe search for a vaccine itself is a complex and low-level process. It follows the same principle: scientists try to create something similar, but not as dangerous as pathogens. He then contacts the body's immune system through vaccination. Ideally, the machine remembers an exciter. Under the influence of the new virus, the human body began to react before the infection. However, some experts fear that this balance could be undermined in a rush to vaccinate. This may lead to the deterioration of the disease. According to Reuters, studies have shown that coronavirus drugs have a development risk of so-called antibody dependent infection aggravating syndrome. About This refers to a process in which the disease does not recede after the use of the vaccine, on the contrary, the disease is aggravating.\nIf it is a sudden outbreak, as now, the vaccine problem is more complicated. The virus may appear and disappear in a few months, with rapid changes in transmission. So while watching countries try to find vaccines at the same time, it's more accurately lottery rather than competition. Each team has its own ticket, and whether it will win depends not so much on speed or skill as on the coincidence of success. It's worth remembering that the more teams in the game, the greater the chance of success. From a commercial point of view, the development of vaccines is a dangerous undertaking. It's important to know that only a few candidates can achieve clinical trials.\nVaccination time\nEven if the drug is now available, it will take at least a year and a half of testing before it can be delivered to ordinary consumers. Who says at least 18 months. Once the vaccine is considered effective, mass production is needed. Most organizations trying to win covid-19 don't have the ability at all.\nThese companies intend to support the global innovation alliance to prevent epidemics, CEPIAbout The international organization is ready to invest in vaccine development and increase production at the same time. Recently, she said $2 billion is needed to support drug development. Without that money, the vaccine development program would not be fully implemented, according to Richard Hackett, CEPI's executive director.\nHowever, the obstacles are not over. Another challenge is to provide vaccines to all who need them. In general, the epidemic has the greatest impact on the poorest countries. It's just that they don't have the money to build an effective health care system. This also affects vaccine procurement opportunities. For example, during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the wealthiest countries bought most of their medicines, while the poor countries had nothing. There is another possibility. India, for example, which is a major supplier of vaccines to developing countries, has decided first to use its productive capacity to protect populations under one year of age. Three billion dollars, and then exports drugs to others. This situation can fully explain why the U.S. authorities are willing to get vaccines at all costs.\nIn this regard, who can bring together governments, philanthropic foundations and vaccine manufacturers to agree on a global equitable distribution strategyAbout However, the epidemic is different, in which case no country is obliged to comply with any international regulations. As Jonathan Kwik, a health expert at Duke University in North Carolina, points out, politics and economics are likely to hinder immunization. \"\nWilder Smith, a new infectious disease professor at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine, believes the epidemic is likely to peak and fall to its current level. \"How to get a vaccine.\" In this case, drugs can still save many lives, especially if the virus circulates like flu and there are new seasonal outbreaks.\nBut before vaccine production begins, the disease must be controlled as much as possible.

Members of the most affected communities, such as Italy and Spain, have to wait for help from Beijing, not Brussels.\nWithout China, Europe cannot protect itself from the corona disaster. In any case, the president of Serbia, Alexander vuccic, is convinced of this. He believes that the unity of the whole Europe is on paper, but at a critical moment, real aid can only come from Beijing. This was announced by the president of the Republic after the declaration of a state of emergency.\nTell me who your friend is\n\"We cannot import medical equipment from European Union countries,\" Ursula von der lain, President of the European Commission, said recently\nBrussels does ban the provision of medical equipment to non EU members to protect its resources in the event of a pandemic. Serbia is currently only a candidate country and therefore does not qualify for assistance.\n\"It's the right decision because it's the device we need for our health,\" he wrote on his twitter\nOn the one-on-one issue, Serbia seeks China's assistancAbout Recently, countries have stepped up cooperation, so Belgrade is often criticized in Brussels.\n\"I wrote a letter to President Xi, in which for the first time he officially referred to him as not only a dear friend, but also a brother, not only my personal friend, but also a friend and brother of the country.\" -Vuccic stressed. He asked China to provide all necessary help to fight the Colorado virus - \"even send us doctors because our doctors are exhausted.\"\nEveryone for himself\nHowever, practice shows that Brussels cannot help not only its neighbours, but also EU members. Last month, when covid-19 spread rapidly in Italy, Rome sought EU assistance through the emergency coordination centre. \" We have asked for medical equipment, and the European Commission has sent this call to all States parties, Mauricio Massari, permanent representative of Italy to the European Union, said. But it doesn't work. \"\nAt that time, no EU country provided assistance to Italy. This is a real tragedy for a country where, as of 19 March, the total number of people infected with coronavirus has exceeded 35000 and the number of deaths has reached nearly 3000. Italian doctors have to work day and night in the face of a continuous shortage of equipment and materialAbout In many other countries in the European Union, the pollution situation is relatively calm, and these countries themselves have received Brussels's assistance many times. Especially Eastern European countries. But no country is in a hurry to help its most affected neighbours. On March 13 alone, Italian media reported that Germany intended to \"send millions of masks to Italy\". This is the only assistance Rome has received from its EU colleagues in the fight against covid-19.\nIn Italy's view, Europe once again left on its own in a serious crisis, as in the euro crisis after 2008. Then, in the refugee crisis that began in 2015, and now in overcoming the virus crisis in 2020, experts pointed out in the article that, \"International policy and society\".\nItaly, after all, has support. At midnight on March 12, a Chinese plane landed in Rome. There were nine medical experts and 31 tons of medical supplies on board, including special care facilities. Personal protective equipment and antiviral drugs. At about the same time, a Chinese truck carrying 230 boxes of medical equipment arrived in Italy. In a telephone conversation with Italian foreign minister Luigi de Mayo, his colleague Wang Guangya promised to send more money to Rome than he didAbout However, even if the help is two days after the call.\nChina emergency rescue\nIt turns out that in a pandemic in Europe, China wants more than Serbia or Italy. The foreign minister of the Kingdom has promised medical assistance to Spain, the second EU contaminated country. A cargo plane from Shanghai landed at Zaragoza airport on Tuesday, delivering 500000 medical masks to the UK. Another $300000 Belgium received masks from Chinese charities set up by Alibaba. Xinhua \"released a picture of a container with the slogan\" act as one, in French, Flemish and Chinese. \".\nAnd Poland will get $10000 from China Tests for coronavirus and protective clothing for doctors. France has also received assistance from Beijing, which has declared the epidemic a third level.\nOn Wednesday, a Chinese plane carrying anti-virus equipment landed in France. On the plane, there are about one million masks and protective gloves. Another plane will arrive from China on Thursday, \"French Foreign Minister Jean Yves ledrian said on bfmtv television. He stressed that the cooperation between France and China in disease prevention and control is successful. \" We used to work together to protect ChinAbout Now China responds to our actions with a gesture of solidarity, which we appreciate. \" In addition, China is committed to simplifying the procedures for the supply of drugs to the EU through commercial channels.\nChina's assistance is not limited to European countries. The government and non-governmental organizations provided doctors and medicines to Cambodia, Iran, Iraq, the Philippines and other countries. For example, billionaire Jackie Ma donated 1000000 medical masks and hundreds of thousands of tests to the United States. In addition, Amnesty International announced that it would send 20000 \"Afghan refugees\". Test package, 100000 sets (thousands of US dollars) UNCTAD also provided technical assistance to African countries.\nNew solidarity\nThe EU has always maintained that it is not just an economic or political union, but a community of ideas and values. But the story of covid-19 makes it clear that these values are not based on helping each other. After the end of the crisis with the Colorado virus, Europe's coordinated policies need to be reassessed. Otherwise, the new challenges will continue to threaten the unity of the alliance.\nThe dependence of EU Member States on China's aid not only reflects the difficulties within Europe. Particularly unfavourable in the context of the crisis is the reaction of Brussels, the main ally of the United StateAbout When Beijing sends aid and experts to the European Union, trap closes the border to keep Europeans out of its country.\nBut China has successfully demonstrated to the EU who their true and reliable partners are. This is a major achievement of our foreign policy. Especially in recent years, the West has demonized Beijing more and more. The Chinese government has played an important role in helping the EU, even in the World Health Organization. Her director, teros Adana gugliese, called it \"a model of solidarity between China and Italy.\". This will help China more effectively implement its infrastructure plan within the EU, especially the development project \"one belt one road\". Premier Li Keqiang expressed confidence in a telephone conversation with Ursula The bilateral relations between China and the EU in the process of jointly fighting against pneumonia will be further strengthened. He added that China intends to strengthen cooperation with European countries in the economic field and continue to strengthen investment ties.\nIn this case, some experts believe that China is actively involved in the fight against the \"soft power\" epidemic. About\n\"The Chinese government is trying to extend its power beyond the border and establish China as a world leader, doing what the U.S. government has done for nearly a century, and \"The distribution of medical assistance is part of this task,\" said Dr. Yang Yang, a researcher at Cornell University, Column of \"Chinese Journal of science\".\nEven so, it is difficult to argue with China's leadership in the fight against the Libyan Arab Emirates. For the first time in 24 hours since the outbreak of Colorado virus in China, no cases have been found nationwide, according to China's National Health Commission.

Los Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades dicen en su sitio en Internet que el virus está ligado a un \"mercado de mariscos y animales vivos\" donde los humanos podrían haber contraído el virus de un animal. El virus luego se propagó persona a persona.(  here  )\nLos síntomas de la enfermedad COVID-19 incluyen fiebre, cansancio, tos y dificultades para respirar que pueden aparecer entre dos a 14 días después de la exposición al virus(  here  ). La propagación del coronavirus se da persona a persona.(  here  )\nLos teléfonos móviles usan ondas de radio. Ellos envían y reciben campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia (CEM RF). El 5G utiliza una \"tecnología de conformación de haces\", que permite que los campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia vayan directamente donde se necesita (  here  ).\nLa Comisión Internacional sobre Protección Frente a Radiaciones No Ionizantes (ICNIRP, por su sigla en inglés) publicó en 2020 normas para limitar la exposición a campos electromagnéticos, después de siete años de investigación. Ellas incluyen información sobre las redes 5G.\nLa comisión dice que el principal efecto que los campos electromagnéticos de radiofrecuencia tienen en el cuerpo humano es una mayor temperatura del tejido expuesto. El cuerpo puede manejar pequeños aumentos de la temperatura corporal, como durante el ejercicio, pero la exposición a radiofrecuencia y la mayor temperatura pueden ser peligrosas sobre cierto umbral (  here  ).\nSegún la ICNIRP, \"otra característica general de los CEM RF es que mientras mayor sea la frecuencia, menor es la profundidad de penetración de los EMFs en el cuerpo. Como las tecnologías 5G puede utilizar mayores frecuencias de CEM (>24 GHz) además de las usadas actualmente (<4 GHz), el poder de esas mayores frecuencias será absorbido principalmente a un nivel más superficial que el de las tecnologías de telecomunicaciones previas (...) Por ende, la exposición al 5G no causará ningún daño siempre y cuando se adhiera a las normas de la ICNIRP (2020)\" (  here  ).\nEric van Rongen, presidente de ICNIRP, dijo en un video que no hay evidencia de que los campos electromagnéticos causen efectos en la salud como el cáncer, la electrohipersensibilidad, la infertilidad o alguna otra cosa. Los únicos dos efectos reconocidos en la salud son la estimulación nerviosa sobre los 10 MHz y el calor desde los 100 kHz (  here  ).\nLa Organización Mundial de la Salud dice que ninguna investigación ha asociado la exposición a la tecnología inalámbrica con efectos negativos para la salud (  here  ). La OMS afirma en su sitio en Internet que seguirá revisando investigaciones en esta área y realizando \"evaluaciones al riesgo para la salud\" de todos los rangos de radiofrecuencia que estarán disponibles en 2022.\nMarvin C. Ziskin, profesor emérito de Radiología y Física Médica, dijo que no hay fundamentos para esperar que la red 5G provoque condiciones adversas de salud, siempre y cuando se respeten los límites de exposición.\nZiskin dijo a Reuters, “El peso de la evidencia científica indica que las emisiones 5G no son acumulativas. Eso significa que múltiples exposiciones inocuas no se suman para producir un efecto biológico adverso. Agregaría que no ha habido advertencias de agencias sanitarias sobre posibles riesgos a la salud de la energía de RF, incluidas ondas milimétricas a los niveles de exposición que un consumidor promedio experimentaría de la tecnología de comunicaciones. Esto es consistente con la evaluación del tema realizada por grupos que establecen estándares como el IEEE y el ICNIRP”, refiriéndose al Instituto de Ingeniería Eléctrica y Electrónica.\nLos síntomas del coronavirus se pueden hallar en detalle en sitios oficiales de gobiernos y de organizaciones sanitarias internacionales. No tienen ninguna similitud con los posibles efectos en la salud derivados del uso de teléfonos móviles o las redes 5G.\nFalso: No hay relación entre el brote de COVID-19 y los posibles efectos de las redes 5G en la salud.\nEste artículo fue realizado por el equipo Reuters Fact Check.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK/ LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - New York state suffered another quick and brutal rise in the number of COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, staggering hospitals at the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, as California said it could be facing the next major wave of the disease.\nIn New York City, the densely packed home of more than 8 million people, healthcare officials tried to find hospital beds for the surging number of coronavirus patients as the statewide death toll rose to 210, with more than 25,600 confirmed cases.\nThe White House advised anyone who has visited or left New York to isolate themselves.\n“Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread to others, no matter where they have gone, whether it’s Florida, North Carolina or out to far reaches of Long Island,” Deborah Birx, who is helping lead the White House coronavirus tax force, said at a late-afternoon press conference.\nThe expected need for hospital beds in New York state at the peak of the outbreak has spiraled to 140,000, nearly three times what are available. Infections were now doubling every three days in New York and the worst could still be two to three weeks away, said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.\nNationwide, COVID-19, which broke out late last year in Wuhan, China, has infected more than 53,000 people and killed at least 720.\nPresident Donald Trump declared major disasters for New York and Washington state, the nation’s first hot spot and accounting for at least 117 deaths, and said he would soon do the same for California.\n“We are enduring a great national trial,” Trump said. The president softened a vow to reopen the nation’s economy by Easter, saying he’ll listen to experts first, including Birx and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nIn California, where 51 people have died and 2,200 tested positive, Governor Gavin Newsom said fully half the confirmed cases were between the ages of 18 and 49, figures he said are “a reminder for everybody to take this seriously.”\nNewsom cited the death of a teenage boy in Los Angeles County, although health officials there said the case was complex and an “alternate explanation” is possible.\nNewsom, who warned that half of Californians - or about 25 million people - could potentially be infected in the coming two months, said the next six to eight weeks would be pivotal in determining whether a clampdown on residents has slowed the spread of coronavirus.\nCalifornia also desperately lacks the hospital beds it needs to care for so many critically ill patients, Newsom has said, although Tesla co-founder Elon Musk “came through on his promise” to deliver over 1,000 badly needed hospital ventilators, and the state brought another 3,000 online.\nThe U.S. Navy hospital ship Mercy was expected to arrive at in Los Angeles on Friday with 1,000 hospital beds to ease the burden on the state’s healthcare system.\nDespite the crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1933 after U.S. lawmakers said they were close to a deal for a massive economic rescue package in response to the outbreak.\nThe World Health Organization said on Tuesday the United States had the potential to become the global epicenter of the pandemic, citing a “very large acceleration” in coronavirus infections.\nDemocrats, including Governor Cuomo, have criticized Trump, a Republican, for suggesting he would reopen the nation’s economy by mid-April.\n“If you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it’s no contest. No American is going to say accelerate the economy at the cost of human life,” Cuomo said earlier in the day.\nNewsom did not criticize Trump but said April would be “sooner than any of the experts that I’ve talked to would believe is possible” for California to lift its restrictions.\nThe governors of at least 18 states in recent days have issued stay-at-home directives. The sweeping orders, unprecedented in their breadth and depth, encompass about half the nation’s population.\nThe rules are based on social distancing principles designed to put more space between individuals in order to slow the spread of the highly contagious and potentially lethal virus.\nEven before the first statewide controls went into effect last week in California, the coronavirus pandemic had virtually paralyzed sectors of the U.S. economy and upended daily lives of Americans as school districts and colleges canceled classes.\nAmericans reported frayed nerves after days of working from home, unable to take part in many activities and looking after children with no schools to attend.\nTerri Gilbert Thompson, 44, and her husband Scott, both teachers in Hilltown, Pennsylvania juggled teaching remotely with homeschooling their own three children.\n“It has been a challenge, but we are willing to make it work to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread,” Thompson said. “We’re doing our best to keep our students engaged in learning, monitor and enrich our own kids’ learning, while maintaining our own sanity during this challenging time.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported 46 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, while the city of Wuhan, the pandemic’s ground zero, announced it would be loosening a two-month lockdown by gradually resuming public transportation and allowing healthy people to resume work.\nIt was the fourth day in a row with an increase in Chinese cases, all but one of which was imported from overseas.\nBut in a sign of easing lockdown measures, residents living in and outside Wuhan will be allowed to travel into the city to resume work if they have a green health code issued by the government and normal body temperature, state-media CCTV News reported on Sunday. It cited the city’s epidemic prevention and control command center.\nNon-local people stranded in Wuhan can also apply to leave the city after taking an RNA test and receiving a health certificate from the government, the channel said.\nDespite the relaxed measures for Wuhan and a reduced number of domestically transmitted cases — the one reported on Sunday was the first in four days — China is seeing a steady rise in imported cases, mostly Chinese people returning from overseas.  That has led Beijing to further step up measures to intercept cases from abroad as the outbreak worsens globally.\nIn a sign of how seriously China is taking the threat of imported cases, all international flights due to arrive in Beijing starting Monday will first land at another airport, where passengers will undergo virus screening, government agencies said on Sunday, in an expansion of existing measures.\nInternational flights that were scheduled to arrive in the capital will land instead at one of 12 airports. Passengers who clear screening will then be permitted to reboard the plane, which will then fly to Beijing, the regulator said.\nSeparately, Shanghai and Guangzhou both announced that all arriving international passengers will undergo an RNA test to screen for coronavirus, expanding a program that previously only applied to those coming from heavily-hit countries.\nAmong the new cases from abroad reported on Sunday, a record 14 were in the financial hub of Shanghai and 13 were in Beijing, a decline from 21 the previous day.\nThe new locally transmitted case was in the southern metropolis of Guangzhou and was also the first known case where the infection of a local person was linked to the arrival of someone from overseas, according to Guangdong province.\nHu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of the Global Times newspaper, called for all cities in China to implement 14-day quarantines for people arriving from abroad.\nHe also called for quarantine policies to apply to people from Hong Kong and Macau as well, he said on his Weibo account on Sunday.\n“I am worried that there are similar cases to the Guangzhou one existing in other parts of the country. There were reports previously that people coming back from abroad returned to their homes in Shanghai without any obstacles,” Hu said.\n“It matters to the overall situation of China’s next prevention and control efforts if we can plug the leaks.”\nThe Global Times is a tabloid published by the Ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily.\nThe latest figures from China’s National Health Commission bring total reported coronavirus cases in the country to 81,054, with 3,261 deaths, including six on Saturday. On Saturday, China reported 41 new coronavirus cases for the previous day, all of them imported.\nOf all 97 imported cases as of end-Saturday, 92 of them are Chinese nationals and 51 are Chinese students returning from studying abroad, said Gao Xiaojun, spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Health Commission during a press conference on Sunday.\nThe Beijing health commission announced separately on its website it had two more imported cases on Sunday, bringing the city’s total number of imported cases to 99 as of Sunday noon.\nChina is trying to revive an economy that is widely expected to contract deeply in the current quarter, with life slowly returning to normal in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, albeit with everyone wearing masks in public.\nStill, numerous shops and restaurants remain shut - many have gone out of business - and factories and other workplaces are still not operating at full capacity.\nOn Sunday, a central bank official called for stepped-up global policy coordination to manage the economic impact of the pandemic. He said China’s recent policy measures were gaining traction, and it has capacity for further action.\nChen Yulu, a deputy governor at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), also said he expects significant improvement in the Chinese economy in the second quarter.\nAnd while the virus will continue putting upward pressure on near-term consumer prices, there is no basis for long-term inflation or deflation, he told a news briefing.\nGlobally, roughly 275,000 people have been infected with the virus, and more than 11,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally, with the number of deaths in Italy recently surpassing those in China.\n“Now I think the epidemic has been controlled. But this definitely doesn’t mean that it’s over,” said a 25-year-old woman surnamed He who works in the internet sector and was visiting the vast Summer Palace complex in Beijing on Saturday.\n“I’m willing to come out today but of course I am still afraid,” she told Reuters.\nThe central province of Hubei, where the outbreak first emerged late last year in its capital Wuhan, reported its fourth straight day of no new cases.\nChina has used draconian measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down Hubei province.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (Reuters) - The European, Americas and final world qualifying boxing tournaments for the Tokyo Olympic Games were suspended on Monday after falling victim to the coronavirus outbreak sweeping the globe.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC), whose Boxing Task Force (BTF) is organising the events after the suspension last year of world body AIBA, acted as countries went into lockdown and sport ground to a halt.\nThe Americas and final world tournaments have yet to happen but the 10-day European event at London’s Copper Box, on the site of the 2012 Olympics, was already into its third day of competition.\nSixteen male boxers, flyweights and featherweights, still managed to secure their tickets to Tokyo before the shutdown came into force at the end of Monday’s evening session.\nBritish flyweight Galal Yafai was the first to qualify, even if the Games’ July 24 starting date is looking increasingly uncertain.\nYafai beat Russia’s Rasul Saliev to reach the quarter-finals, with a guaranteed Tokyo slot for the last eight in the division, and was followed by top-seeded Frenchman Billal Bennama.\n“With everything that’s gone on this week outside of boxing, it’s great to just get it done,” Yafai, who fought at the 2016 Rio Games, told the BBC.\n“I put it to the back of my mind this week, but just before the fight I was told that the competition would end after today, so I was thinking ‘oh gosh, I need to make sure I win’.”\nThe BTF had already closed the doors to spectators after Sunday’s sessions.\nAfrica, Asia and Oceania have held their qualifying tournaments while the Americas one scheduled for Buenos Aires on March 26-April 3 was postponed last week. The final worlds were due in Paris on May 13-20.\nThe Asia and Oceania event was held in Amman, Jordan, this month after being moved from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic.\nThe task force said it would provide details on the qualification process for the other regions at a later date.\n“The BTF...took the decision to suspend the event today, amid increasing global travel restrictions and quarantine measures, in order to allow the participants from over 60 countries to adjust their travel plans and return home,” the IOC said in a statement.\n“The BTF will continue to evaluate the situation daily, aiming to complete the distribution of the remaining Tokyo 2020 boxing quota places in May and June.”\n“The BTF’s priority remains the qualification of athletes on the field of play, and it will inform all stakeholders as soon as more information is available,” it said.\nThe IOC will hold talks with heads of international sports organisations on Tuesday in response to the coronavirus outbreak and will also hold an unscheduled Executive Board teleconference to discuss the latest developments.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nFor the chair of the University of Michigan School of Public Health's biostatistics department and professor of biostatistics, epidemiology as well as global public health, the situation around her in the US looked pretty grim.\nAnd getting grimmer.\nHer parents were far away in Kolkata.\nThere was a travel ban in place.\n\"I have been in this country since 1996. I came as a graduate student to do my PhD.\nIt has been about 24 years. I've never felt this helpless -- that even if I want to, I cannot go back to India, if something happens to my parents.\"\nThe news out of India, which was not yet facing any significant number of coronavirus cases, looked unsettling.\nIndia seemed unprepared, not testing enough and not entirely willing to believe that the covid-19 tsunami was headed her way.\nDr Mukerjee knew, from looking at the stats, that each death conceals 1,000 additional maybe hidden cases.\nA few calls around made this Indian-origin epidemiologist realise that there were many like her in the \"same boat\" including some of her Indian graduate students.\nEveryone was worried sick about India and their folks and could not go back home.\nThat inspired them to get together and work on a special epidemiological report on the potential coronavirus situation for India.\n\"I'm a data scientist. I can only look at data. I cannot go to the front line and cure people. Or try to discover drugs. I can only try to unravel the patterns that are hidden in the data and help the public.\"\nWhen they started up their work, India was lagging behind other countries in Europe and America, in covid-19 cases, because India had less China connections, says Dr Mukherjee, and cases only began to trickle in after Thailand, Singapore and other Asian countries got infected.\nBut that did not mean, as per her and her team's calculations, India would escape without serious casualties.\n\"It is amazing that when a team of people work, you can accomplish something really remarkable... One of my colleagues actually had built this (epidemiological covid-19 assessing) model for Hubei (China).\n\"And he was continuously telling me that, you know, for China, I cannot do anything, because I cannot change policy because it was already been done. But for India use this model. It's really, actually very important right now.\"\nSo she collaborated with her colleague Professor Peter X K Song, and his student Lili Wang, using their modelling, package and software, and a team from the department of biostatistics, as well as biostatistics specialists, from other universities, to construct this report.\n\"It all came together. In four days. I barely slept. My team barely slept. We really wanted to get the data out there. This gave (us) purpose. It was a very positive thing for us to do.\"\n\nOne the main conclusions of Dr Mukherjee's team's report was that India needed a man-made disruption of some sort to stop the burgeoning tide of covid-19 cases flowing across India.\nThat fortuitously happened on March 24 when Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi announced a three-week nation-wide lockdown.\nThe government could look at extending that date or modifying the nature of the clampdown after they, like Dr Mukherjee, figure out what is the \"optimal period of lockdown.\"\n\nPlease click on the graphics and table for a full-screen resolution.\n\nWe thought there would be a huge impact (with) an intervention.\nOur calculations are really supported by what happened in two other countries -- that it was, actually, in two weeks, three weeks, were able to contain it.\nNow, whether this is going to go away.\nThat's another question.\nRight.\nThat's the pivotal question.\nIs this just a matter of three weeks?\nWe have to be really cautious and really devise how the absolute lockdown will naturally open.\nYou (India) may not need such draconian measures (beyond three weeks).\nI do think that you need long term support, economic support, and surveillance to contact chasing and large-scale testing, building healthcare capacity.\nThe lockdown is giving you time, and there's an exceptional value in time because if you can give the right treatment and treat people, then the mortality is not that high.\nBut if people do not get the right treatment then there are too many patients and too few beds and too few ventilators, then then the death rate is going to be very high.\nThe death rate in South Korea, because they could detect early and could contain the disease is about 0.1 per cent.\nIn China it has been three to four per cent, which is a huge difference.\nI do feel that slowing down the process is extremely critical.\nAnd that's why every epidemiologist, everyone has been talking about flattening the curve.\nIndia needs more, because it has one-fourth the number of hospital beds, maybe one-tenth the number of ICU beds and ventilators compared to the other countries that we are talking about.\n\n\nYeah, so it's 2.8 for 1,000.\nSo that's the World Bank number.\nThe UK is also 2.9.\nI was surprised with the numbers, honestly, but that's the World Bank data source.\nI don't have any other sources of data where I can verify across the different countries.\nYou know, I'll be honest with you, that when I first started looking at this data, I am not an infectious disease epidemiologist.\nI started looking at the data.\nAnd it is striking to me how similar the US numbers are to the numbers in Italy, at a lag of 11 days.\nThey are just almost like within one week of each other.\nI found that very fascinating: Why is the USA 11 days behind Italy?\nThen I plotted the Indian numbers, and they were exactly almost 11 to 13 days behind US numbers, right.\nThere is the pattern that was just fascinating to me as a mathematician, and when we looked at all the growth curves, the initial period is very slow, and that's exactly why it's deceptive.\nThere are lots of asymptotic cases and you are thinking that the cases are ten when there are hundreds of cases which are asymptotic, right?\nThat's why it creeped in very slowly and then exploded suddenly, that's what we call like the exponential growth.\nSo every curve is like an S shaped curve where it's very low, and then there's a boom, and then it plateaus.\nThis looks so predictable.\nThat's why I started modelling (a simple, mathematically-formalized way to estimate reality) it.\nBecause there is a lot that could be told, because the progress of contagion is somewhat mathematically defined.\n\n\nWhat I suspect -- and I didn't know because I really started looking at the data in India in depth -- and others probably I just looked at the patterns...\nWell, what are the intrinsic causes I do not know.\nBut what I read, I am about to tell you: In the initial period in Italy, the first few carriers were really super carriers.\nThey were asymptomatic and they were very active people and they went and infected many, many people.\nIf your initial carrier is like a very quiet person, does not interact, doesn't go to the gym, does not go to the restaurant, that could have a completely different impact.\nThat's very critical, because the first few people can infect hundreds of people...\nThat's what can change this -- the initial group (infected).\nAlso what I heard: My brother actually lives in Italy and he had done some wonderful pieces, that he wrote for a Bengali newspaper, that they were not following social quarantine,\nThey interpreted it in a very cavalier, European, way, and they were still going to bars.\nUntil there was a central lockdown.\nThey were showing their spirit which is what you want to do at this time.\nExactly.\nThe attitude: That this is not a big deal for my country.\nAnd then from there to central lockdown!\nIt has taken maybe a few days in many countries, so should we (India) make that mistake?\nSo that's exactly why this (lockdown).\nYou have country after country showing that is what works.\nThere is no reason to not call for this.\n\nSo you should look at Table II (below), where we actually tabulate how many million people are in the comorbid categories, that are have been already identified to be more vulnerable to the coronavirus.\nAmong them diabetes and hypertension really stands out and cancer too, because usually cancer patients, after going through chemotherapy, they have immunity compromised.\nThose numbers are worrisome.\nI calculated like 122 million people with diabetes.\nJust the sheer population, if you think that 20 per cent of the affected cases will have to be hospitalised and about 10 per cent will actually need a ventilator.\nBecause of the population of India if this really spreads and is not going to be localized, then it's going to be a disaster.\nThose are point estimates.\nSo in any statistical estimation there is no one answer.\nThere is a wide interval.\nSo in our first graph (Figure 1), you see the bars, which are the projections, and 59,000 is an estimate but the upper line is really 900,000 right?\nSimilarly, that 15,000 is sort of the best medium estimate, but there is uncertainty around it.\nThe main takeaway message is very clear.\nThat from millions and hundreds of thousands, you can come down to less than, like 50,000.\nWe are talking about a drastic drop in terms of the projected number of cases.\nThere is a small possibility, but as I told you, that India is not doing large-scale testing.\nAs far as deaths goes if there are nine deaths, then there are probably 9,000 or 7,000 to 10,000 cases in the community, according to the calculations.\nYou are not getting them (to these cases).\nYou are not chasing them.\n(If you do then) I think this is still containable.\nBut if we don't do testing, there will probably be asymptotic cases of quarantined people.\nYou will never get that exact count.\nSo this is based on how many people you test and the confirmed cases with the low level of testing in India.\nWe may never know the number of true cases because we are not doing large-scale testing.\n\nIMAGE: Table 2\n\n800 to 900 is the estimate, according to the other studies, behind each death.\nTesting capacities need to expand.\nI think this time, with the lockdown, should be devoted to expanding testing and treatment capacity, because you are sort of pushing behind the tidal wave.\nBut there will be a strong wave coming and you need to build your dam.\nThere are different components of the dam and building testing and treatment capacity (are two of the components).\nOkay, community transmission has not happened.\nI believe the government data.\n(But) what I would really like to recommend is to treat respiratory illness cases all across the country.\nTest some of those people.\nThe serious people are going to have serious respiratory illness and are going to be admitted to the hospital.\nYou can randomly test these people for covid-19 and see if anybody turns out to be positive.\nSo some kind of network of monitoring and surveillance.\nYou can do this in an intelligent way.\nIn villages test the people who have returned (from the cities).\nIn India, only 20 per cent people probably have private (health) insurance.\nIf you actually looked at insurance claims that also may show some spike, which could be predictors of something coming.\nI do think that the respiratory illness is a symptom, and you should randomly test those people.\nYou have to be intelligent if you don't have enough number of tests.\nYou don't have to test anybody, but you still have to be thoughtful in terms of what is going to be the surveillance strategy, in the meantime, as the central lockdown is going on.\n\n\nThis is an interesting question.\nWhat South Korea did is sort of maybe interesting here.\nWhat they did was really cluster testing.\nThat if one person was found to be showing symptoms, then they tested the whole community, maybe the whole apartment building or the entire (community) of the church (where the person went to).\nSome kind of surveillance with cluster testing will have to be in place.\nBut we also have to be prepared that some people are going to fall sick.\nFortunately, 80 per cent of the people do not need hospitalisation.\nTwenty per cent of these people are going to need hospitalisation.\nWe have to make sure they are treated so that their chance of survival is strong.\nFor that, two things we have to do -- we have to repurpose some of the existing facilities in terms of quarantine wards or hospitals.\nAnd then we have to protect our healthcare workers, so that they do not die.\nThey are the most vulnerable, as well.\nYou have seen so many unfortunate deaths in frontline health care workers in US and other countries.\nYou have to make sure that they have the protective gear, like gloves, gowns, masks.\nWe really have to put all our resources into thinking about surveillance and testing strategy.\nThis is my personal opinion.\nAs well as preparing to be caring for a number of people, who are going to fall sick inevitably, in the next few weeks.\nYeah, I do not know.\nI saw some numbers.\nI'm not sure I believe them.\nEven in the United States, I'll be honest with you, that we got an e-mail from our health system to donate protective gear, if we have them saved in the house.\nSo even a country like United States is massively running out of these supplies.\nBut I think that India is (looking) at creative ways -- I heard.\nThis is a war.\nIt requires partnership between private organisation and the government and requires partnership between the government and the public.\nI really liked Prime Minister Modi's speech because he was appealing to the heart of the public (about) how critical this is.\nAnd if there is any chance of adherence and listening to him, then you need a public-government-industry partnership with scientists and experts, partnership with these different branches.\nBut what I also think that India will have its own creative ways of emerging out the crisis, for example, in West Bengal I heard that many of the stadiums are being converted into temporary quarantine wards.\nI heard that many people (among) students are making masks.\nWe have very big society.\nOur solution is not going to be the solution of the West.\nBut if we know what we want to achieve, then we can achieve the solution in a different way.\nWe have tremendous capacity.\nWe may want to take over some plants, clothing plants or fabric plants and just make masks.\nSuch choices I think India can do.\nPeople can help.\nWe have to be really, really mindful of what is coming and have a long-term strategy.\n\n\nWhat China did, we cannot do.\nChina had a lot of control on their public.\nThey mandated, I think, that one person can go out three times a week or something like that.\nSo they really chartered and rationed that.\nYeah, that's hard to say.\nAlso a function of whether they are going to expand the testing criteria right.\nThere could still be some cases where there are mild symptoms and whether they are going to become confirmed cases, or not, depends on who you are testing.\nHard to answer.\nBut according to our calculations, there will be a drastic drop with the lockdown.\nWith only social distancing and travel ban, there was going to be 48 cases per 100,000.\nThat means somewhere around 55,000 cases.\nBut with the lockdown that number came down to somewhere like you know, 15,000 to 20,000.\nIn context of India, in Table Four (please see), we project, that under surveillance that if there was 161 (cases), how it came down to 48, and then to four and then to one (with a combination of all three).\nI believe that these (methods) will be effective.\nI cannot and I don't dare to project the number.\nThe qualitative takeaway message is that this will reduce the numbers.\nThe exact numbers we do not know.\nBut without it, it is going to be much, much, much, much worse.\nIn the meantime, we really need to work on a sort of war footing, given that it is a natural disaster, provide relief, provide essentials, till we get biological herd immunity, we need to get economic immunity, and also social immunity.\nBecause these times are very hard for people in confined spaces and not being able to have their daily wages.\nThe government has to be really creative on how to make people adhere and not go astray with this ban, which is not an easy task.\nIt's quite a daunting task.\nThis is the hard situation right?\nYou're trying to optimise the control of the virus.\nThen there are other economic holes and detriments and social detriments that you are facing.\nBut I don't see a choice.\nI think what has been done is the right thing from a public point of view.\n\n\n\n",

Wang合作，使用他们的建模、软件包和软件，以及来自其他大学的生物统计学系和生物统计学专家的团队来构建这份报告。\n“一切都集中在一起了。再过四天。我几乎没睡。我的团队几乎没睡。我们真的很想得到数据。这给了我们目的。对我们来说，这是一件非常积极的事情。”\nMukherjee博士的研究小组的报告的主要结论之一是，印度需要某种人为的干扰，以阻止covid-19病例在印度迅速蔓延。\n3月24日，莫迪总理宣布在全国范围内实施为期三周的禁闭，这是一个巧合。\n政府可以考虑延长这一日期，或者在他们像穆克吉博士一样找出什么是“最佳封锁期”之后，修改取缔的性质\n请单击图形和表格以获得全屏分辨率。\n我们认为干预会产生巨大的影响。\n我们的计算得到了另外两个国家所发生的事情的支持——事实上，在两周、三周内，它就能够控制住。\n现在，这是否会消失。\n那是另一个问题。\n正确的。\n这是关键问题。\n这只是三个星期的事吗？\n我们必须非常谨慎，真正设计出绝对封锁将如何自然打开。\n你（印度）可能不需要这样严厉的措施（超过三周.\n我认为你需要长期的支持、经济支持和监督来联系追踪和大规模的检测，建立医疗能力。\n封锁给了你时间，时间上有一个特殊的价值，因为如果你能给予正确的治疗和治疗，那么死亡率就没有那么高。\n但如果人们得不到正确的治疗，那么病人太多，床位太少，呼吸机太少，那么死亡率就会非常高。\n韩国的死亡率约为0.1%，因为他们可以及早发现并控制这种疾病。\n在中国，这一比例为3%至4%，这是一个巨大的差异。\n我确实觉得放慢进程是非常关键的。\n这就是为什么每一个流行病学家，每个人都在谈论如何使曲线变平。\n印度需要更多，因为它拥有四分之一的医院床位，也许是我们正在谈论的其他国家的ICU床位和呼吸机数量的十分之一。\n是的，所以1000英镑是2.8英镑。\n这是世界银行的号码。\n英国也是2.9。\n说实话，我对这些数字感到惊讶，但那是世界银行的数据来源。\n我没有任何其他的数据来源可以在不同的国家进行验证。\n你知道，老实说，当我第一次看这些数据的时候，我不是传染病流行病学家。\n我开始看数据。\n在我看来，美国的数据与意大利的数据非常相似，相隔11天。\n他们就差一个星期就差不多了。\n我发现这很有意思：为什么美国落后意大利11天？\n然后我画出了印度的数字，它们正好比我们的数字晚了11到13天，对吧。\n作为一个数学家，有一种模式对我很有吸引力，当我们观察所有的增长曲线时，最初的周期非常缓慢，这就是为什么它是欺骗性.\n有很多渐近的情况，你认为当有几百个渐近的情况时，情况是十个，对吧？\n这就是为什么它缓慢地进入，然后突然爆炸，这就是我们所说的指数增长。\n所以每一条曲线都像一条S形的曲线，在它很低的地方，然后是一个繁荣期，然后是一个停滞期。\n这看起来很容易预测。\n这就是为什么我开始建模（一个简单的，数学形式化的方法来估计现实）它。\n因为有很多东西可以告诉我们，因为传染病的发展在某种程度上是由数学定义的。\n我怀疑的是——我不知道，因为我真的开始深入研究印度的数据——其他人可能我只是研究了模式。。。\n我不知道内在原因是什么。\n但我读到的是，我要告诉你们：在意大利的初期，最初的几家航空公司确实是超级航空公司。\n他们没有症状，他们是非常活跃的人，他们去感染了很多人。\n如果你最初的载体是一个非常安静的人，不互动，不去健身房，不去餐厅，那可能会产生完全不同的影响。\n这很关键，因为最初的几个人可以感染数百人。。。\n这就是可以改变这一点的——最初的群体（感染者）。\n我还听说：我哥哥实际上住在意大利，他为一家孟加拉报纸写了一些精彩的文章，说他们没有遵守社会隔离制度，\n他们用一种非常傲慢的、欧洲式的方式来解释它，而且他们仍然要去酒吧。\n直到中央封锁。\n他们在展示他们的精神，而这正是你现在想要做的。\n确切地。\n态度：这对我的国家来说不是什么大事。\n然后从那里到中央封锁！\n在许多国家，这可能需要几天的时间，所以我们（印度）应该犯这个错误吗？\n所以这就是为什么（封锁.\n你有一个又一个国家的表现，这才是有效的。\n没有理由不要求这样做。\n所以你应该看看表二（下表），我们实际列出了共病类别中有多少百万人，这些人已经被确定更容易感染冠状病毒。\n其中糖尿病和高血压最为突出，癌症也最为突出，因为通常癌症患者经过化疗后，免疫力下降。\n这些数字令人担忧。\n我估计有1.22亿糖尿病患者。\n如果你认为20%的病人需要住院治疗，大约10%的病人需要呼吸机，那么仅仅是普通人群。\n因为印度的人口，如果这种情况真的蔓延开来，不会本地化，那将是一场灾难。\n这些是点估计。\n所以在任何统计估计中都没有一个答案。\n间隔时间很长。\n所以在我们的第一张图（图1）中，你看到了条形图，这是投影图，59000是一个估计值，但是上面的线是900000对吧？\n同样，这15000人是最好的中等估计数，但也存在不确定性。\n主要的外卖信息非常清楚。\n从几百万到几十万，你可以降到不到50000。\n我们说的是预计病例数量的急剧下降。\n有一个很小的可能性，但正如我告诉你的，印度没有进行大规模的测试。\n据计算，就死亡人数而言，如果有9人死亡，那么社区大概有9000或7000至10000例。\n你不能（把他们）带到这些案子里去。\n你不是在追他们。\n（如果你那么做）我认为这仍然是可以控制的。\n但如果我们不做检测，可能会有被隔离的人的渐近病例。\n你永远也得不到确切的数.\n所以这是基于你检测了多少人以及在印度检测水平低的确诊病例。\n我们可能永远不知道真实案例的数量，因为我们没有进行大规模测试。\n图片：表2\n根据其他研究，每一次死亡的背后，估计有800到900人。\n测试能力需要扩大。\n我认为这次，随着封锁，应该致力于扩大测试和处理能力，因为你是某种推动潮汐波。\n但会有一个强大的浪潮来，你需要建立你的水坝。\n大坝有不同的组成部分和建筑试验处理能力（都是其中的两个组成部分）。\n好吧，社区传播还没有发生。\n我相信政府的数据。\n（但是）我真正想推荐的是在全国范围内治疗呼吸系统疾病。\n测试其中一些人。\n严重的人会有严重的呼吸系统疾病，要住院治疗。\n你可以随机检测这些人的covid-19，看看是否有人呈阳性。\n所以某种监控网络。\n你可以用一种聪明的方式做到这一点。\n在村庄里测试（从城里）回来的人。\n在印度，只有20%的人可能有私人（健康）保险。\n如果你真的看了保险索赔，也可能会出现一些高峰，这可能是一些未来的预测。\n我认为呼吸系统疾病是一种症状，你应该随机测试这些人。\n如果你没有足够的测试次数，你必须聪明。\n你不必测试任何人，但你仍然必须考虑到什么是监视策略，同时，随着中央封锁的进行。\n这是个有趣的问题。\n韩国在这里所做的也许有点有趣。\n他们真正做的是集群测.\n如果一个人被发现有症状，他们会测试整个社区，可能是整个公寓楼或者整个教堂（这个人去的地方）。\n一定要有集群测试的监控。\n但我们也必须做好准备，一些人会生病。\n幸运的是，80%的人不需要住院治疗。\n其中20%的人需要住院治疗。\n我们必须确保他们得到治疗，这样他们的生存机会就很强。\n为此，我们必须做两件事——我们必须将一些现有设施重新用于隔离病房或医院。\n然后我们必须保护我们的医护人员，以免他们死亡。\n他们也是最脆弱的。\n你在美国和其他国家的一线医疗工作者身上看到过这么多不幸的死亡。\n你必须确保他们有防护装备，比如手套，长袍，面具。\n我们真的要把所有的资源都投入到监视和测试策略上。\n这是我个人的看法。\n以及准备照顾一些人，他们将不可避免地生病，在未来几周。\n是的，我不知道。\n我看到一些数字。\n我不确定我是否相信他们。\n即使在美国，我也会对你说实话，我们收到了一封来自卫生系统的电子邮件，如果我们把防护装备保存在家里的话，就可以捐赠。\n所以，即使是像美国这样的国家，这些物资也大量短缺。\n但我认为印度正在寻找有创意的方式——我听说。\n这是一场战争。\n它需要私人组织和政府之间的伙伴关系，需要政府和公众之间的伙伴关系。\n我真的很喜欢莫迪总理的演讲，因为他在向公众呼吁这有多重.\n如果有机会坚持并倾听他的意见，那么你需要与科学家和专家建立公共政府与行业的伙伴关系，与这些不同的部门建立伙伴关系。\n但我也认为，印度将有自己的创新方式来摆脱危机，例如，在西孟加拉邦，我听说许多体育场馆正在被改造成临时隔离区。\n我听说许多学生在做面具。\n我们的社会很大。\n我们的解决方案不会是西方的解决方案。\n但如果我们知道我们想要实现什么，那么我们就可以用不同的方式实现解决方案。\n我们有巨大的能力。\n我们可能要接管一些植物、服装植物或织物植物，只做面具。\n我认为印度可以做出这样的选择。\n人们可以帮忙。\n我们必须真的，真的意识到即将发生的事情，并有一个长期的战略。\n中国做了什么，我们做不到。\n中国对他们的公众有很大的控制权。\n我认为，他们规定一个人一周可以出去三次或类似的活动。\n所以他们真的包租和配给。\n是的，很难说。\n同时也是他们是否会正确扩展测试标准的函数。\n仍有可能出现一些症状轻微的病例，这些病例是否会成为确诊病例，取决于你测试的是谁。\n很难回答。\n但根据我们的计算，随着封锁的进行，将会有一个大幅度的下降。\n由于只有社会距离和旅行禁令，每10万人将有48起案件。\n这意味着大约55000箱。\n但随着封锁，这个数字降到了你知道的15000到20000。\n在印度的情况下，在表4（请参阅）中，我们预测，在监视下，如果有161例（病例），那么它是如何降到48例，然后降到4例，然后降到1例（三者结合）。\n我相信这些方法是有效的。\n我不能也不敢说出数.\n定性的外卖信息是，这将减少数量。\n确切的数字我们不知道。\n但没有它，情况会越来越糟。\n同时，我们确实需要在一种战争的基础上工作，考虑到这是一场自然灾害，提供救济，提供必需品，直到我们获得生物群体免疫，我们需要获得经济免疫，也需要获得社会免疫。\n因为这段时间对于身处密闭空间的人来说非常艰难，无法获得每日工资。\n政府必须在如何让人们坚持这一禁令而不是误入歧途上真正有创意，这不是一项容易的任务。\n这是一项相当艰巨的任务。\n这是个艰难的局面，对吧？\n你在努力优化病毒的控制。\n此外，还有其他的经济漏洞和危害，以及你所面临的社会危害。\n但我没有选择。\n我认为从公众的角度来看，所做的是正确的",

        "news_content_translate_en": "China reported 78 new confirmed cases, including 74 imported infections, while the death toll from the novel coronavirus increased to 3,277 after seven more fatalities were confirmed from the COVID-19, health officials said on Tuesday.\n\nThe overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland have reached 81,171 by the end of Monday. This included 3,277 people who died of the disease, 4,735 patients who were still being treated and 73,159 patients discharged after recovery, the National Health Commission said on Tuesday.\nThe NHC said, 78 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported on the Chinese mainland on Monday, of which 74 were imported from abroad taking the number of overseas cases to 427.\nAlso on Monday, seven deaths and 35 new suspected cases were reported on the mainland with all the deaths in Hubei Province.\nThe total COVID-19 cases in Beijing climbed to 522 with eight deaths prompting local governments of Beijing as well as Shanghai to announce that all overseas arrivals will be subjected to nucleic acid tests to ensure proper detection.\nOf the 74 newly imported cases, 31 were reported in Beijing, 14 in Guangdong, nine in Shanghai, five in Fujian, four in Tianjin, three in Jiangsu, two in Zhejiang and Sichuan respectively, and one in Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong and Chongqing respectively, the NHC said.\nBeijing is already diverting all international flights to different cities where the passengers will be quarantined for 14 days before arriving in the city.\nThe NHC said 132 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.\nCoronavirus epicentre Wuhan has reported one confirmed case after a gap of five days prompting officials to begin to ease restrictions.\nWuhan also reported seven new deaths, bringing the total number of deaths in the city and Hubei province for which Wuhan is the capital to 3,160.\nThe province also saw 444 patients discharged from hospital after recovery on Monday. Among the 4,200 patients being treated in hospital, 1,203 were still in severe condition and another 336 in critical condition, the local health commission said.\nBy the end of Monday, 356 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, which has restricted the entry of foreigners into the city. Also a total of 25 confirmed cases were reported in Macao and 195 in Taiwan including two deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reporrted.\nAfter days of decline in coronavirus cases, China on Monday said that COVID-19 has effectively been \"stemmed\" in the country and it started easing severe restrictions imposed on Wuhan's 11 million people who were under lockdown since January 23.\nThe authorities began relaxing restrictions in Wuhan as it reported no new case for the fifth consecutive day on Monday.\nSignificantly, the Central Leading Group, headed by Premier Li Keqiang which is coordinating efforts to contain the virus since January 23, said the virus has been curtailed in the country as well as in Wuhan. \"The meeting noted that the spread of the virus nationwide, particularly in the epicentre of Wuhan, has been effectively stemmed,\" an official statement said on Monday. The meeting, however, warned that the risks for sporadic infections and localised outbreaks have not gone away. With the pandemic rampaging across the world, the situation remains complex and challenging. \"Wuhan city and Hubei province should stay focused on medical treatment and community-level containment as the two key priorities. They should continue to treat the severe cases, promptly admit new cases, and advance epidemiological investigations,\" the meeting said. In Wuhan, officials said people are allowed to go back to work while restrictions on the public transport are gradually being eased.\nThe Hubei province and its capital Wuhan with over 56 million people were under lockdown since January 23. The vicious virus broke out in city, reportedly at a live animal market in December last year and became virulent inflicting thousands of people in the city and province catching the government off guard. As the country saw a surge in imported infections, the Chinese government announced that all international flights scheduled to arrive in Beijing will be redirected to airports in 12 other Chinese cities from Monday. International passengers flying to Beijing will instead land at airports in 12 cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and Shenyang as their first points of entry, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said in a statement. On Monday, China said international travellers should \"think twice\" about choosing Beijing for flight transfer in view of the restrictions. Starting from Monday, all international flights scheduled to arrive in Beijing will be redirected to airports in 12 other Chinese cities, Liu Haitao, an official with China's National Immigration Administration said. Passengers would go through entry procedures and quarantine measures at the designated cities' airports before they continue their flights to Beijing, Liu said, urging travellers to reserve enough time for their next flights to make sure that they do not miss their outbound flights.\n",

It raises many questions and we are assessing the situation,\" they said in a statement .\"At this time, we want our fans, sponsors, broadcasters, staff, volunteers, players and the great city of Boston to know that we intend to hold Laver Cup 2020 as currently scheduled.\"The men's ATP Tour, women's WTA Tour and International Tennis Federation have yet to respond publicly to the move but players around the world have hit out at the lack of communication from the game's governing bodies.Canadian Vasek Pospisil, a member of the ATP's Players Council, slammed the FFT decision as \"selfish\" and \"arrogant\" while some women's tour players posted memes on social media to voice their ire.The United States Tennis Association (USTA) earlier released a statement which said there were no plans to alter the schedule for the August 25-September 13 US Open and went on to obliquely criticising unilateral changes to the Grand Slam calendar.\"At a time when the world is coming together, we recognize that such a decision should not be made unilaterally,\" it read.\"Therefore the USTA would only do so in full consultation with the other Grand Slam tournaments, the WTA and ATP, the ITF and our partners, including the Laver Cup.\"Wimbledon organisers said they are still proceeding on the basis that the grasscourt Grand Slam would start on June 29, while organisers of the Australian Open are continuing to work towards the usual January start for the 2021 edition.Organisers of the Korea Open said they had yet to hear from the WTA about the implications of the French Open move on their tournament, which was scheduled to take place in Seoul from September 21-27.\"We are still in talks of adjusting the Korea Open tour schedule, but nothing has been decided yet,\" an official told Reuters. \"The schedule would probably change according to amendments in WTA calendar.\"The China Open in Beijing and Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo did not have any clarity on their events.\"China Open has not received any notice of schedule adjustment from WTA and ATP, and is currently preparing for the event according to the original schedule,\" a tournament official said.The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 190,000 and killed more than 7,500 people worldwide.The ATP Tour have announced a six-week suspension, the WTA Tour have cancelled events until May 2, and the ITF has called off all its events including next month's new-look Fed Cup finals in Budapest.\n",

The choice of vegetables changed every day.\nThe most fearsome thing was the testing of body temperature. One boy who was with us, his body temperature rose suddenly and so was immediately moved to the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi for three days.\nAll his tests were re-done at Safdarjung hospital and luckily it came out negative. The same was the case with all of us who came from Wuhan.\nWhat I have learnt from my stay at the ITBP camp is that the first precaution we should take is to keep away from any suspected patient.\nTo protect oneself one must use a mask to cover the mouth, and if you don't have a mask then keep a handkerchief.\nIf a person carrying coronavirus sneezes or coughs, if her/his spit falls on you then you will get infected.\nOne way to prevent this is if you drink morning tea then you can put ginger in it or kaali miri in it which makes your immune system strong. This can stop coronavirus from spreading to some extent as tea with ginger makes your immune system stronger.\nThe most dangerous way of spreading of coronavirus is metal. If a coronavirus patient holds a metal door handle the coronavirus attaches itself to it.\nCoronavirus can easily stay alive longer on any metal. Therefore, whenever you touch any metal object, then you must wash your hands instantly, use a sanitiser or wash your hands with soap. Train metal doors and handles are also very dangerous.\nThere is no vaccine to cure, but the HIV vaccine can help. There is no guarantee, but China has done so and managed to save some patients, I have learnt.\nThe worst part is that one patient can spread the virus to at least 10 people and those 10 people can in turn spread it to 100 and those 100 to another 1,000 and so on.\nTherefore, prevention is better than cure so ensure that you follow all precautions to avoid contacting coronavirus.\nWe were told by the ITBP that if any of us had been found positive, then all of us would have to stay in quarantine for 14 days more.\nWe all were very scared of this. If anyone sneezed by mistake then there used to be a fight. Because no one wanted to add another 14 days because of just one patient.\nThere were three South Indians who sneezed and they were taken away immediately. Again, thankfully, it was found out that it was because of the little weather change and therefore they were sneezing.\nAt the end of it we all became friends. We now have friends the world over right from Myanmar, Maldives to China because we were on that floor at the ITBP hospital.\nI am planning to go back to China at the end of April, to Beijing. I am not tense about it because life in Beijing is normal and I am getting scared in India.\nJust now, when I sat in the car, the driver saw us wearing maskS and he got scared because we had just come out of the ITBP hospital. We immediately took our masks off. If not, I felt he would have asked me a lot of questions about why we were wearing the maskS.\nI feel India is fully prepared to take on coronavirus. Right now I have come to know that at the ITBP camp there are 1,800 beds that have been made available.\nThere are Indians who are going to come from Iran and around 5,000 of them are coronavirus suspects. The government has made good arrangements to tackle this situation.\nAt the ITBP camp, doctors have arrived from different hospitals from every state of India. They saw our camp and saw what kind of systems are in place to tackle coronavirus.\nThey have got first-hand information and training on how to deal with suspected coronavirus cases. So I am sure India will handle the coronavirus situation well.\nToday I am leaving the ITBP centre and going back home, but I have been told by doctors that I must keep away from my ageing parents for 14 days because coronavirus is lethal for old people.\nI am happy that finally I will be out in the open air and breathe rather than live a quarantined life for nearly almost two months.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "New Orleans rushed to build a makeshift hospital in its convention center on Friday as troubling new outbreaks bubbled in the United States, deaths surged in Italy and Spain and the world warily trudged through the pandemic that has sickened more than a half-million people.\nPunctuating the fact that no one is immune to the new coronavirus, it pierced even the highest echelons of global power, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson becoming the first leader of a major country to test positive.\nWhile New York remained the worst-hit city in the US, Americans braced for worsening conditions elsewhere, with worrisome infection numbers being reported in New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit.\n\"We are not through this. We're not even half-way through this,\" said Joseph Kanter of the Louisiana Department of Health, which has recorded more than 2,700 cases, more than five times what it had a week ago.\nNew Orleans' sprawling Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, along the Mississippi River, was being converted into a massive hospital as officials prepared for thousands more patients than they could accommodate.\nThe preparations immediately conjured images of another disaster, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the convention center became a squalid shelter of last resort in a city that has braved a string of storm hits, not to mention great fires and a yellow fever epidemic in centuries past.\nAs the new health crisis loomed, economic catastrophe had already arrived in the city, where many already live in poverty and the tourism industry has screeched to a halt.\n\"I've never been unemployed. But now, all of a sudden: Wop!\" said John Moore, the musician best known as Deacon John, who has no gigs to perform with much of the city shut down.\n\"It ain't just me. It's everybody.\" In New York, where there are more than 44,000 cases statewide, the number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 passed 6,000 on Friday, double what it had been three days earlier.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo called for 4,000 more temporary beds across New York City, where the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center has already been converted into a hospital.\n\"This is going to be weeks and weeks and weeks,\" Cuomo told members of the National Guard working at the Javits Center.\n\"This is going to be a long day, and it's going to be a hard day, and it's going to be an ugly day, and it's going to be a sad day.\"\nUS President Donald Trump, after earlier rejecting Cuomo's pleas for tens of thousands more ventilators, and the governor's calls to use the Korean War-era Defense Production Act, invoked the law Friday, ordering General Motors to begin manufacturing the breathing machines.\nTrump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package, after the House approved the sweeping measure by voice vote. Lawmakers in both parties lined up behind the law to send checks to millions of Americans, boost unemployment benefits, help businesses and toss a life preserver to an overwhelmed health care system.\nThe US neared 100,000 confirmed cases, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Italy, the US and China account for nearly half the world's more than 585,000 infections and more than half of the roughly 26,000 reported virus deaths.\nDr. John Brooks of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Americans remained \"in the acceleration phase\" of the pandemic and that all corners of the country were at risk.\n\"There is no geographic part of the United States that is spared from this,\" he said.\nIn a phone call Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping told Trump that China \"stands ready to provide support within its capacity,\" the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\nTrump, who has repeatedly referred to the outbreak as a \"Chinese virus,\" struck a different tone Friday, tweeting after the call that \"China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!\" In Europe, Italy recorded its single biggest 24-hour rise in deaths, with 969 more victims, to bring its total number of fatalities to 9,134.\nThe country now has more than 86,000 cases, surpassing China to record the grim distinction of the second-most infections in the world, behind the U.S.\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella called it \"a sad page in our history.\"\nItalian epidemiologists warn that the country's number of cases is likely much higher than reported - perhaps by five times - although two weeks into a nationwide lockdown the daily increase seems to be slowing, at least in northern Italy.\n''It is something devastating,'' said the Rev. Mario Carminati, whose church in the tiny Lombardy town of Seriate has been used to hold coffins of the dead before they are taken by military convoy for cremation.\nSpain, with the world's fourth-biggest number of cases, reported another 7,800 infections for a total of more than 64,000. The country said health workers accounted for about 15 percent of its cases.\nDeaths in Spain climbed past 4,900 - the world's second-highest total after Italy.\nIn Britain, Boris Johnson's office said the prime minister was tested after showing mild symptoms for the coronavirus. He was self-isolating and continuing to lead Britain's response to the pandemic.\n\"Be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team, to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,\" Johnson said in a video message, adding that he had a temperature and persistent cough.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Shares opened sharply higher in Asia on Wednesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 with Congress and the White House nearing a deal on injecting nearly $2 trillion of aid into an economy ravaged by the coronavirus.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped 5.3 per cent, while Hong Kong added 3 per cent and Sydney climbed 3.6 per cent. Markets across Asia were all up more than 2 per cent.\nThe Dow burst 11.4 per cent higher, while the more closely followed S&P 500 index leaped 9.4 per cent as a wave of buying around the world interrupted what has been a brutal month of nearly nonstop selling. Investors released some frustration that had pent up over days of watching the US Senate stalemate over the crucial rescue package.\nDespite the gains, investors were far from saying markets have hit bottom. Rallies nearly as big as this have punctuated the last few weeks, and none lasted more than a day. Economists and investors alike are still expecting to see some dire economic numbers in the days and weeks ahead.\nToday was a good day, but we would not necessarily see this as turnaround time, said Adam Taback, chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank.\nBoth Democrats and Republicans said Tuesday they’re close to agreeing on a massive economic rescue package, which will include payments to US households and aid for small businesses and the travel industry, among other things. A vote in the Senate could come later Tuesday or Wednesday.\nInvestors were imploring Congress to act, particularly as the Federal Reserve has done nearly all it can to sustain markets, including its latest round of extraordinary aid launched Monday.\n\"It’s sort of like, keep the patient alive in the emergency room so you can provide some treatment options,\" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.\nThe Dow rose 2,112.98 points, its biggest point gain in history, to 20,704.91. The S&P 500, which is much more important to most 401(k) accounts, rose 209.93, or 9.4 per cent, to 2,447.33 for its third-biggest percentage gain since World War II. The Nasdaq composite jumped 557.18 points, or 8.1 per cent, to 7,417.86.\nIn Asia early Wednesday, Tokyo’s Nikkei was at 19,053.40, while the Hang Seng rose to 23,374.57. South Korea’s Kospi gained 4.2 per cent to 1,678.13 and the S&P/ASX 200 picked up 3.6 per cent to 4,906.10. Taiwan’s benchmark jumped 4.4 per cent.\nUS crude oil gained 88 cents to $24.89 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international pricing standard, added 91 cents to $30.65 per barrel.\nIn currency trading, the US dollar was at 110.90 Japanese yen, down from 111.22 yen late Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0803 from $1.0790.\nEarlier share rebounds have evaporated. Since stocks began selling off on Feb. 20, the S&P 500 has had six days where it’s risen, and all but one of them were big gains of more than 4 per cent. Afterward, stocks fell an average of 5% the next day.\n\"One of the things to be careful about is thinking this will be the panacea or that this fiscal response will be sufficient,\" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management.\nUltimately, investors say they need to see the number of new infections peak before markets can find a floor. The increasing spread is forcing companies to park airplanes, shut hotels and close restaurants to dine-in customers.\nPresident Donald Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual town hall that he hopes to open up the economy by Easter. Analysts said the pronouncement wasn’t a contributor to the day’s huge rally, which was mostly due to the stimulus hopes.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Those with mild illness recover in about two weeks. Severe illness including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems. Recovery could take six weeks in such cases.\nEconomists are topping each other’s dire forecasts for how much the economy will shrink this spring due to the closures of businesses, and a growing number say a recession seems inevitable.\nSome of the market’s areas hardest hit by the closures, though, led the way higher Tuesday as expectations rose for incoming aid from the US government.\nNorwegian Cruise Lines, MGM Resorts and American Airlines Group were all up at least 33 per cent. Energy companies and banks were also strong, though all remain well below where they were a month ago.\nGovernments and central banks in other countries around the world are unveiling unprecedented levels of support for their economies in an attempt to limit the scale of the upcoming virus-related slump. Germany, a bastion of budgetary discipline, also approved a big fiscal boost.\nThe gains came even as the first reports arrived showing how badly the outbreak is hitting the global economy. In the United States, a preliminary reading on business activity in March showed the steepest contraction on record, going back to 2009. Reports were also gloomy for Europe.\nEveryone was prepared for a set of shockers, and that is precisely what we got, but they are not a surprise, said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. It is at times like this that the market’s propensity to look forward is demonstrated most effectively.\nMore gloomy data is nearly assuredly on the way. On Thursday, economists expect a report to show the number of Americans applying for jobless claims easily set a record last week. Some say the number could be way beyond 1 million, amid a wave of layoffs, topping the prior record of 695,000 set in 1982.\nHelping to lift sentiment in markets was news from China that it is preparing to lift the lockdown in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and from Italy reporting a reduction in the number of new cases and coronavirus-related deaths.\n\"It’s still early days, of course -- perhaps investors can start to envisage life beyond the coronavirus,\" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe. That could make stocks look a little more attractive, although anyone jumping back in now will need to have nerves of steel.\nDespite Tuesday’s big gains, it’s no time to get complacent, said Wells Fargo’s Taback.\n\"We would caution that the danger is not all behind us at this point, he said. We still have not seen numbers that give us an indication of just how bad things are.\"\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Singapore, a tiny city-state of less than 6 million people, had one of the earliest and biggest clusters of cases of the coronavirus in early February, before it began its rapid, inexorable expansion around the globe.\nWithin weeks, the country's tally of infections with the highly contagious virus that causes COVID-19 was overtaken by skyrocketing caseloads in South Korea, several European countries and the U.S.\nSome strategies are proving more effective than others in containing the pandemic: pro-active efforts to track down and isolate the infected, access to basic, affordable public health care, and clear, reassuring messaging from leaders. East Asia's experience with the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China, has likewise helped.\nSince testing rates vary widely, it's hard to know for sure. But Singapore appears to be among the handful of places that tick all those boxes, though recent spikes in new cases show that any lapses can have dire consequences.\nSingapore's first case, confirmed on Jan. 23, was a 66-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the disease was first detected in late December.\nBy mid-February, the number of recovered patients in the Southeast Asian city-state was outpacing new ones. That changed in early March after 47 cases were tracked to a Feb. 15 dinner gathering. As of Wednesday, Singapore had 266 confirmed cases and no deaths from the virus.\nAs new infections increased, the government tightened quarantine controls.\nTaiwan, a self-governed island off the coast of mainland China, has confirmed just 77 cases and one death. Most recent cases were residents returning from overseas travel.\nHong Kong has reported 167 cases and four deaths. Its leader, Carrie Lam, on Tuesday warned against all outbound travel and said any people arriving from outside greater China will face 14-day home quarantines or medical surveillance.\nOf the 13 cases found in the tiny gambling enclave of Macao, 10 have recovered. Casinos have been closed for weeks to battle the outbreak.\nCambodia, which has confirmed a dozen cases, last weekend moved to stop foreigners traveling from France, the U.S., Spain, Germany, Italy and Iran after several new cases were found among travelers.\nThailand, likewise, appears to have kept cases under control with aggressive public health campaigns intended to minimize infections, though new cases jumped recently as stepped-up testing found clusters linked to a boxing tournament and an evening gathering at a bar. So far, 177 cases have been confirmed among 70 million Thais, even though it's a top destination for travelers, especially from China.\nAssuming the numbers reported to the World Health Organization are accurate, many of the countries with lower caseloads are relatively isolated geographically: Singapore, New Zealand, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Mongolia. Some others may be latecomers in testing and reporting: Russia, Indonesia, Vietnam.\nFor Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the experience of battling the 2003 SARS outbreak, which infected some 8,000 people and killed nearly 800, helped ensure residents took the risks seriously, experts say.\n\"Almost everyone played ball and followed accordingly,\" said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital. \"SARS was our baptism by fire and we were forced to learn everything by swimming in the deep end of the pool.\"\nAfter the SARS outbreak, when 238 people were infected and 33 died in Singapore, the city revamped its already excellent health care system, writing up new protocols for containing outbreaks. It set up \"fever centers\" to isolate suspected cases, invested in equipment and improved training in handling infectious diseases, Leong said. So when the first case of COVID-19 was discovered, Singapore was ready to act, he said.\nFrom Feb. 1, Singapore blocked entry and transit for new visitors who had traveled to mainland China within 14 days. These restrictions have since expanded to include visitors with recent travel to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea.\nWhen the number of local cases without links to previous cases or travel in China surged, the government raised its alert to \"orange,\" the second-highest level, on Feb. 7. The Singapore Air Show, a huge event that draws thousands, scaled back the number of participants and barred most exhibitors and visitors from China from attending. Good hygiene and avoiding handshakes were recommended.\nThe National Public Health Laboratory, set up after SARS, was prepared to fast-track testing, using advanced diagnostics and newly developed COVID-19 test kits.\nRapid testing and isolation of suspected cases, and painstaking tracing of contacts, helped by police, surveillance videos and ATM records, have helped prevent a worse local outbreak, said Tikki Pangestu, a visiting professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and former director of WHO's research policy and cooperation department.\nOnce a COVID-19 case is confirmed, Singapore embarks on \"diligent contract tracing,\" said Pangestu. It ordered workers arriving from countries with endemic virus infections to stay home. Worship services were suspended in favor of livestreaming after a cluster was found at a church. Schools suspended mass assemblies and staggered recess.\nSo far, 5,700 people have been quarantined.\nIn Thailand, too, public health workers have gone door-to-door to track down contacts, said Thanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department of the Health Ministry. \"We must go see them ourselves. This is an old public health way. We do our best,\" he said.\nIt has mostly worked. But newly confirmed clusters show one dinner, one boxing match or one religious gathering can undo weeks of work.\nInitially, Germany was thought to have done relatively well at slowing the spread, but infections there have jumped to 9,360.\nIn South Korea, where more than 270,000 people have been tested, newly discovered cases are dropping sharply, but clusters are still popping up, at a call center, at a church.\nThis week, Malaysia has reported a surge in cases linked to a religious gathering in its capital last week. Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia also have confirmed new cases linked to that gathering.\nIt's unclear if the strategies used in an authoritarian society like Singapore would work in bigger countries whose citizens expect greater personal freedoms: In March, a Chinese couple was charged under Singapore's Infectious Diseases Act for misinforming health officials and obstructing contact tracing. If convicted, they may be imprisoned or fined.\nBut as virus controls expand to unprecedented levels in many other countries, the policies are looking prescient.\nSingapore is a small island with strong public trust in the government, \"a strong healthcare system, excellent information systems and plenty of money,\" said Pangestu. \"Many other countries, especially developing ones, do not have these capacities or characteristics.\"\nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, lauded for adopting a calming, clear approach early on, said in a televised talk last week that the situation was under control but the government was planning ahead, trying to free up hospital beds to be prepared for any surge in cases.\nSingaporeans \"feel we are all in this together,\" Lee said, \"and we don't leave anyone behind.\"\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡是一个人口不到600万的小国，在2月初爆发了最早、规模最大的冠状病毒病例群之一，之后又开始在全球迅速、不可阻挡的扩张。\n数周内，韩国、几个欧洲国家和美国的病例数量猛增，超过了该国感染导致COVID-19的高传染性病毒的人数。\n事实证明，有些战略在遏制这一流行病方面比其他战略更为有效：积极努力追踪和隔离受感染者，获得基本的、负担得起的公共卫生保健，以及领导人发出明确、令人放心的信息。东亚在2003年爆发的严重急性呼吸系统综合征（SARS）中的经验也同样有助于解决这一问题。\n由于检测率差别很大，很难确定。但新加坡似乎是少数几个勾选所有这些方框的国家之一，尽管最近新案件的激增表明，任何失误都可能带来可怕的后果。\n新加坡1月23日确诊的第一例病例是一名66岁的男子，他来自中国武汉市，该市在去年12月底首次发现了这种疾病。\n到2月中旬，这个东南亚城市国家的康复病人人数超过了新病人。这一情况在3月初发生了变化，此前有47起案件被追踪至2月15日的聚餐。截至周三，新加坡有266例确诊病例，没有死于该病毒。\n随着新感染病例的增加，政府加强了检疫控制。\n台湾是中国大陆沿海的自治岛屿，目前仅确诊77例，死亡1例。最近的案例是从海外旅行归来的居民。\n香港报告了167例和四例死亡病例。其领导人林郑月娥（Carrie Lam）周二警告说，所有出境旅行都要受到警告，并表示，任何从大中华区以外抵达的人都将面临14天的家庭隔离或医疗监。\n在澳门这个小小的赌博天堂发现的13起案件中，有10起已经找到。为了应对疫情，赌场已经关闭了数周。\n柬埔寨已经确认了十几起病例，上周末在旅客中发现多起新病例后，柬埔寨采取行动阻止来自法国、美国、西班牙、德国、意大利和伊朗的外国人旅行。\n同样，泰国似乎通过积极的公共卫生运动来控制病例，以尽量减少感染，不过最近新病例激增，因为加强检测发现，与拳击比赛和晚上在酒吧聚会有关的集群。到目前为止，在7000万泰国人中，已有177例确诊，尽管泰国是旅游者的首选目的地，尤其是来自中国的游客。\n假设向世界卫生组织报告的数字是准确的，许多病例数较少的国家在地理上相对孤立：新加坡、新西兰、尼泊尔、不丹、斯里兰卡、蒙古。还有一些可能是测试和报告的后来者：俄罗斯、印度尼西亚、越南。\n专家们说，对新加坡、台湾和香港来说，2003次SARS爆发的战斗，感染了大约8000人，杀死了近800人，这有助于确保居民认真对待这些风险。\n新加坡伊丽莎白诺夫纳山医院传染病专家梁浩南说：“几乎所有人都打球，然后跟着球走。”“非典是我们受火的洗礼，我们被迫在游泳池的最深处游泳来学习一切。”\n非典爆发后，新加坡共有238人感染非典型肺炎，33人死亡。非典爆发后，该市对已经非常完善的医疗体系进行了改革，制定了控制疫情的新方案。梁振英说，该署设立了“发热中心”，以隔离疑似病例，投资设备，并改善处理传染病的培训。因此，当第一例COVID-19被发现时，新加坡已经准备好采取行动，他说。\n从二月开. 1日，新加坡对14天内前往中国大陆的新游客禁止入境和过境。此后，这些限制扩大到包括最近前往伊朗、意大利北部或韩国的游客。\n2月7日，当与以往病例或中国旅游无关的本地病例数量激增时，中国政府将警戒级别提高到了第二高的“橙色”。新加坡航空展是一项吸引了数千人参加的大型活动，它减少了参展人数，并禁止大多数来自中国的参展商和参观者参加。建议保持良好的卫生，避免握手。\n非典后成立的国家公共卫生实验室准备使用先进的诊断方法和新开发的COVID-19检测试剂盒进行快速检测。\n李光耀公共政策学院客座教授、世卫组织研究政策与合作部前主任蒂基·潘盖斯托说，在警方、监控录像和自动取款机记录的帮助下，对疑似病例的快速检测和隔离，以及对接触者的艰苦追踪，有助于防止当地爆发更严重的疫情。\n一旦一个COVID-19病例被证实，新加坡就开始“努力追踪合同”，Pangestu说。它命令来自地方性病毒感染国家的工人留在家里。在一座教堂发现一个聚集物后，为支持现场直播而暂停了礼拜活动。学校暂停群众集会和错开课间休息。\n到目前为止，已有5700人被隔离。\n泰国卫生部疾病控制司副司长Thanarak Plipat说，在泰国，公共卫生工作者也挨家挨户追踪接触者。”我们必须亲自去看他们。这是一种古老的公共卫生方式。我们尽力了，”他说。\n它基本上起了作用。但新确认的一组显示，一顿晚餐、一场拳击比赛或一次宗教集会可能会使数周的工作付诸东.\n最初，德国被认为在减缓病毒传播方面做得比较好，但那里的感染率已经跃升到9360人。\n在韩国，已经有27万多人接受了检测，新发现的病例正在急剧下降，但在一个呼叫中心、一个教堂，仍有大量病例出现。\n本周，马来西亚报告称，与上周在其首都举行的宗教集会有关的案件激增。柬埔寨、泰国和印度尼西亚也证实了与这次聚会有关的新病例。\n目前尚不清楚在新加坡这样一个独裁社会中使用的策略是否会在公民期望更大个人自由的大国奏效：今年3月，新加坡《传染病法》指控一对中国夫妇误导卫生官员，妨碍接触者追踪。如果被定罪，他们可能会被监禁或罚款。\n但是，随着病毒控制在许多其他国家扩展到前所未有的水平，这些政策看起来很有先见之明。\n新加坡是一个小岛，公众对政府的信任度很高，“强大的医疗系统、优秀的信息系统和充足的资金，”潘格斯图说许多其他国家，特别是发展中国家，不具备这些能力或特点。”\n李显龙总理在上周的一次电视讲话中表示，局势已经得到控制，但政府正在提前计划，努力腾出病床，为病例激增做好准备。\n李明博说，新加坡人“觉得我们都在一起，我们不会丢下任何人。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "With the coronavirus outbreak declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), many companies around the world have asked their employees to work from home until the virus is contained.\nSome large firms and start-ups in India have now followed suit in line with the government's measure to limit the spread of the virus, as the number of confirmed cases in India jumped to over 70.\nIndia also recorded its first death from the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) on Thursday.\nCompanies such as Cognizant, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Uber, Ola, Swiggy, Paytm, Wipro and Tech Mahindra have offered employees the option to work from home.\nThere are many other Indian companies, especially startups, which have asked their respective employees to work from home.\nA Google office in Bengaluru has asked all employees to work from home tomorrow after a techie was tested positive for the virus. The tech firm has already asked all North American employees to work from home.\nSeveral industry bodies like NASSCOM have already requested the government to waive restrictions around work from home in light of the coronavirus outbreak which has spread to hundreds of countries around the globe.\nThough work from home could hurt operations flow at Indian firms, top management at corporate firms has instructed or recommended employees to work from home.\nOne way recommended by health experts in tackling the virus is avoiding large gatherings or social distancing.\nDelhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Friday also advocated social distancing as a measure as the government banned big events, conferences and social gatherings.\nSocial distancing as solution \nIt has worked for China, which finally declared on Thursday that the peak of coronavirus was over in the epicentre Hubei province and Wuhan city. The number of newly reported cases had dropped to 8 for the first time ever since the initial infections were recorded.\nAffected areas in China were kept under lockdown, causing severe disruptions to daily life. Several major factories and industries were shut and people were even asked to work from home.\nThough this caused economic damage to China and the global economy, the \"social distancing\" measures seem to have worked well for the country worst affected by the novel coronavirus.\nMajor technology companies including the likes of Apple are now looking to reopen all branded stores in China after a period of strict measures.\nItaly, which along with Iran is one of the worst affected due to coronavirus, is also following a similar strategy of social lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections. Many factories have been shut as a result of the lockdown.\nEven French President Emmanuel Macron urged employers to allow their staff to work from home, wherever possible.\nMeanwhile, with the number of cases rising in the UK, a leading researcher told everyone in the country, who can work from home, should avoid going to office.\nWilliam Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Dynamics at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health in Boston, told The Guardian that the rising number of infections in the UK could lead to local outbreaks in coming weeks and people should start working from home to prevent the possibility of contracting the coronavirus.\nIMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said in a recent blog post that \"this health crisis will have a significant economic fallout\" due to supply shocks and demand.\nIn short, the economic fallout of coronavirus is unavoidable and efforts should be towards keeping people/employees healthy. This would help affected countries bounce back smoothly, suggest economists.\nTherefore, both economists and health experts suggest that the primary goal in order to bring the global economy back on track is to keep people healthy and safe during the peak of the virus outbreak.\nIndia and its billion-plus\nThe risk of the virus spreading in India is much greater due to the sheer number of citizens. With its billion-plus population, India could find itself in a pool of worries if infections rise. Cases in India have spiked significantly over the last few days.\nSince the precautions to tackle coronavirus are limited, it could be difficult to prevent infections from rising in India, especially in offices that employ a large number of people.\nThe government has directed schools and colleges to be closed, but it would hardly matter if office-goers bring the virus home to their children.\nWhile many humorous takes on the subject have been posted by users on social media, the fact remains that children and other family members are not safe if the working individuals in their family have to face the risks.\nThough a large-scale work from home policy could trigger disruptions in operational flow, companies may follow the trend as the first objective should be to limit the spreading of coronavirus.\nFirms and organisations which have not announced work from home for employees yet have implemented several precautionary measures to prevent the virus from spreading.\nHowever, it should be noted that employees who have to report at work may face a higher chance of contracting the virus. They are exposed to public transport, food, and more people - something that most health experts have asked to avoid.\nOver 700 employees working at a private factory in Noida have been kept under watch after a person was tested positive.\nAt a time when the entire world is trying to fight an unknown virus, experts said each and every part of the society, including organisations and firms, should take all necessary steps to tackle the virus from spreading even at the cost of disruptions.\nAs the saying goes: prevention is better than cure.\n",

With this, the overall number of COVID-19 cases in India touched 50. Of these 50 cases, three have been cured and discharged while the remaining are active cases.\nFour of the six COVID-19 cases that were reported on March 10 were detected in Bengaluru, and two in Pune. All these patients had a travel history to the US or Dubai--two locations where coronavirus cases have been on a rise.\nThe 50th COVID-19 case in India was reported 41 days after the first case was reported in Kerala on January 30. The first patient was a student studying at a university in Wuhan, China (the epicentre of the global coronavirus outbreak) and was spending her vacation at her home in Thrissur district.\nIn a span of four days, two more people tested positive for COVID-19 in Kerala. They too were students who had returned from China on vacation.\nWith the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India crossing 50, we take a look at the first 50 cases to understand the geographical spread of coronavirus outbreak in India and the possible manner in which these patients contracted the viral infection.\nGeographical spread: 50 cases, 12 states & 18 cities\nThe map below depicts the geographical spread of the coronavirus outbreak in India.\nThe storymap below gives a gist of the cases reported in each city/district and whether the patient(s) had any travel history to a coronavirus-hit country or whether they contracted COVID-19 locally.\nTransmission: The travel history of COVID-19 cases\nOur analysis of the first 50 COVID-19 cases shows that a majority of them had a travel history to a country that was already affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Analysing statements issued by the Union Health Ministry, we found that 39 of the first 50 COVID-19 cases in India had a foreign travel history, while 11 cases contracted the infection through local transmission i.e. in India.\nMost of the cases (23) had a travel history to Italy. This included the 16 Italian nationals who tested positive in Jaipur.\nBesides this, four COVID-19 cases had a travel history to Iran and an equal number to the US; three cases had a travel history to China and an equal number to Dubai; one patient had travelled to Oman and one to Thailand and Singapore.\nMeanwhile, the 11 cases that contracted the viral infection in India included:\nThis situation demands caution.\nOf the 11 cases of local transmission, 10 were where the patients came in contact with somebody who had travelled abroad. In other words, these patients are the ones who fell ill without having visited any coronavirus-hit country.\nIt will be important to see if such cases continue to get reported in the coming weeks.\nTimeline of 1st 50 cases\nBesides them, an Indian driver who was hired by the group also tests positive for COVID-19.\nSix COVID-19 cases were also reported in Agra. All of them were people who had been exposed to the Delhi patient detected on March 2.\nOf the five cases, the patient in Delhi did not have any travel history outside India. Health officials said she contracted the viral infection from the techie who tested positive in Gurgaon on March 5.\nThe three-year-old girl in Ernakulam and the patient in Punjab had a travel history to Italy; the patient in Jammu (a 63-year-old woman) had a travel history to Iran.\nThe two patients in Pune had a travel history to Dubai.\nPrecautions you can take\nAs per WHO, you should observe the following precautions:\n",

We won't even allow gyms to be used.\"\nA new government decree that will come into effect Tuesday and last until April 3 will stop games in Italy's top soccer division and preparatory events for the Tokyo Olympics.\nEvents around the world have been affected by the spreading virus, including Champions League soccer matches and Japan's professional baseball season. Late Sunday, one of the biggest tennis tournaments in the world was postponed.\nItaly's top soccer division had resumed on Sunday with five games played in empty stadiums. Twelve rounds remain, with eight-time defending champion Juventus holding a one-point lead over Lazio.\nSerie A has not been canceled since World War II.\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.\nCases of coronavirus in Italy have risen to 7,375, with 366 deaths, the highest number outside of China.\nSassuolo's 3-0 win over Brescia inside an empty stadium on Monday was almost certainly the last Serie A game for several weeks.\nSassuolo striker Francesco Caputo sent a comforting message after scoring the first of his two goals. He displayed a sign that read \"It will all be OK. #Stayathome\" in Italian.\nAnticipating the government's decree, the Italian Olympic Committee said earlier that the decree will not include international competition \"for clubs or national teams,\" since it does not govern those. Juventus, Napoli and Atalanta are each competing in the Champions League, while Inter Milan and Roma are still in the Europa League.\nBut after Conte's announcement, it seemed likely that games like Juventus-Lyon in the Champions League on March 17 would have to be postponed or moved to another country.\nThe Italian swimming federation said it was withdrawing its teams from international events and canceled an Olympic qualifying meet scheduled for next week in Riccione.\nThe Tokyo Games are scheduled to begin in July. More than 300 Italian athletes qualified for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\nIn France, police said that the Champions League match between Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund at Parc des Princes will be played without fans.\nIt is the second of the four matches in the competition this week to be played in an empty stadium. Spanish authorities previously recommended restrictions on games involving teams from areas in Italy with high numbers of virus cases and said the Valencia-Atalanta match on Tuesday will take place without fans in attendance.\nLeipzig's match against Tottenham on Tuesday and Liverpool's home game against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday are expected to be played with fans.\nWednesday's game in Paris will be the first match with no fans at the Parc des Princes in 10 years. The last time it happened, in March 2010, the decision was taken following crowd trouble during a match between PSG and French rival Marseille.\nPSG, which lost the first leg 2-1, said it took note of the decision and said the club remains \"fully mobilized to organize the match in the best possible conditions.\"\nIn the French league, the match between Lyon and visiting Reims on Friday will also be played without fans.\nFrance has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people. The country reported 1,126 cases of the virus as of Sunday, up 19% from the day before and the second largest number of cases in Europe after Italy. So far, 19 people in France have died.\nIn Slovakia, all sports events will be halted starting on Tuesday. The suspension will include games in the top soccer and ice hockey leagues.\nThe virus also forced the postponement of the Six Nations rugby match between France and Ireland. French sports minister Roxana Maracineanu said the decision to postpone was taken after discussions with tournament organizers and the French rugby federation.\nThe game was due to take place on Saturday at the Stade de France. A new date has yet to be announced.\nIn Germany, it will be up to local authorities to decide if fans can attend matches this weekend in the top two divisions, the league's organizers said.\nLast weekend's Bundesliga matches ahead as planned with fans, though Borussia Mönchengladbach refunded tickets for supporters from an area affected by the virus after asking them not to attend the game.\nLocal authorities in the Swiss city of Basel refused permission for the city's soccer team to host Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League on March 19. UEFA has not yet confirmed a venue for the match.\nEven the flame-lighting ceremony for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is being affected. Spectators will be kept away from the event in Ancient Olympia on Thursday, the Greek Olympic committee. Only 100 accredited guests will be allowed to attend.\nAlso, World Cup qualifying games in Asia were formally postponed until at least September, FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation said Monday, but matches could still go ahead on schedule if all relevant parties agree.\nJapanese officials earlier postponed the start of the 12-team professional baseball league season. The season was to open on March 20. Japan's professional league had been playing its preseason games without fans because of the virus.\n\"I personally believe that we have no choice but to postpone at this stage,\" Japanese league commissioner Atsushi Saito said.\nThe announcement to cancel the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, came after many players were already in the desert practicing. Qualifying matches were to begin Monday, with women's main draw matches starting Wednesday and the men's draw beginning Thursday.\n\"We're here and still deciding what's next,\" Rafael Nadal wrote on Twitter. \"So sad for all that is happening around the world with this situation. Hopefully soon solutions from the authorities. Stay all well and safe.\"\nNo restrictions on sport have been introduced yet in Britain where governing bodies and broadcasters met with government officials on Monday to discuss contingency plans if fans need to be banned from events or games are postponed.\nBut the English Football Association on Monday canceled an annual gathering for its staff of around 800 that was due to be held on Thursday at St. George's Park, a hotel and training facility complex in central England.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Novel coronavirus, now named as SARS-CoV-2, is a new pathogen. Understanding novel coronavirus is a work in progress. It may take months or even years before scientists settle for definite conclusions about how novel coronavirus infects people of different health conditions and varying age and gender groups, if at all.\nSince its emergence in November-December in Chinese city of Wuhan, novel coronavirus has infected almost 3 lakh (2.94 lakh) by Monday afternoon, according to the World Heath Organisation (WHO) status update.\nAlmost 13,000 people have lost their lives due to complications caused by novel coronavirus infection. Seven of these deaths have happened in India. Altogether 187 countries have reported cases of novel coronavirus infection.\nOn the basis of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus infections, studies suggest that elderly people are more vulnerable to Covid-19 than younger people. Similarly, novel coronavirus infection has been found to be more sever among men than women.\nThough studies are still on to examine the behavioural pattern of novel coronavirus inside a human body, the difference in the degree of severity of infection could be linked to a protein, scientists working on the virus have suggested.\nThis protein is called ACE-2 - which works for regulation of an enzyme involved with maintenance of blood pressure among other things - and it is found on many surface tissues including in lungs. What has emerged is that the novel coronavirus has an affinity for this ACE-2 protein and identifies this as its landing spot inside the human body.\nNovel coronavirus has many spikes on its outer surface (see the picture). These spikes are used by the virus to hook onto ACE-2 protein and enter the cell.\nOnce inside the cell, novel coronavirus multiplies fast and eats up everything before forcing the cell to burst and release next generation viruses to feed on new cells. In two to ten days, there will be enough novel coronaviruses in the body to start showing symptoms like fever, dry cough and breathlessness among others.\nThis is believed to be the normal course of novel coronavirus infection in human body. What makes it appear differently among different people is the fact that concentration of ACE-2 protein increases in humans with age. Children and young people have fewer than the elderly ones. And, women too have less number of ACE-2 proteins than men of the same age group.\nThis explains why children and young people, who usually have better immunity, have reported milder infection of novel coronavirus compared to elderly ones.\nHowever, existing medical condition could be a bigger determinant of how severe novel coronavirus infection can be in an individual irrespective of gender and age. In India, the youngest person who died after novel coronavirus infection was 38.That person had returned from Qatar and had been admitted in hospital for chronic renal failure.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Wednesday that the coronavirus outbreak could now be characterised as a \"pandemic\". The declaration came as the coronavirus cases are sharply increasing around the world.\nThe WHO also added that Italy and Iran were now on the frontline of the disease and other countries would soon join them.\n\"We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic,\" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe WHO chief, however, maintained that the designation of the coronavirus as a pandemic did not mean the situation was hopeless. \"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,\" he said.\nAddressing a news conference on Wednesday, the WHO chief urged the global community to redouble efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, saying aggressive measures could still play a big role to curb it.\n\"We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nThe outbreak of coronavirus was declared as a pandemic as the United States stocks plunged into bear market territory and several American cities joined European counterparts in banning large gatherings due to the alarming levels of its spread.\nWHAT IS A PANDEMIC\nA pandemic is a worldwide spread of a disease or an infection. The term is associated with the geographic spread and not any characteristic changes in the infection itself.\nWHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use \"pandemic\" as a descriptive term but added that it does not carry any legal significance. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. The novel coronavirus is not the flu.\nHowever, the term should not be confused with an outbreak and an epidemic.\nHOW IS PANDEMIC DIFFERENT FROM EPIDEMIC\nEpidemic comparatively affects fewer number of people and is confined to a certain region. An outbreak is usually the first stages of an epidemic. An epidemic affects a region or a country and starts infecting a large part of the population.\nThe word epidemic originates from the Greek word 'epidemia' while the word pandemic originates from the word 'pandemos', which denotes \"all people\".\nThe ebola spread was an epidemic that affected western Africa and resulted in the deaths of thousands over some years. The SARS outbreak in China was also an epidemic that killed over 800 people.\nA pandemic is when a disease rapidly starts spreading across the world and is no longer restricted to a community or region.\nThe world has seen a number of pandemics in the past involving diseases such as plague, influenza, yellow fever and others. The latest pandemic is the first caused by coronavirus.\nMore than 118,000 cases of coronavirus have emerged in 114 countries and 4,291 people have died so far.\nThe coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industries, markets, bringing flights to a standstill, prompting the latest oil price war, locking down entire nations, closing schools and forcing the postponement of events and concerts across the world.\nThe WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its \"highest level of alarm\", on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of COVID-19 outside China. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the casualties and number of infected persons are expected to rise.\nIn the past two weeks the number of cases outside China had risen 13-fold, and the number of countries affected had tripled, a sombre-looking Tedros said, displaying little of his normally upbeat persona.\n",

Three of the patients have recovered.\nAs concerns over the spread of the virus mounted after two more persons tested positive on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held an extensive review on the preparedness. He urged the people not to panic and instead take basic protective measures.\nSources said the patient from Mayur Vihar in Delhi, who had travelled to Italy recently and tested positive on Monday, was shifted to a quarantine ward at Safdarjung Hospital on Sunday night.\nSamples from six people from Noida, including three children, have been taken to check if anyone has been infected, Noida's Chief Medical Officer Anurag Bhargava said.\nFumigation was underway in both the schools and a Health Department team led by Noida's chief medical officer visited the site, an official said.\nWhile some family members of the man, an accountant and others who came in contact with him were asked to remain quarantined at their homes in Delhi and Agra, six others from Agra with \"high-viral load\" have been kept in isolation at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi and their samples sent to NIV, Pune, officials said.\nContact tracing of the people who came in contact with the six is simultaneously being done through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) network, the Health Ministry said in a statement.\nIn a statement, the Uttar Pradesh government said that two Agra residents, who had come in contact with the Delhi man, were found to be having symptoms of coronavirus.\n\"As many as 23 contacts were identified, and report of 13 persons were obtained. Of these 6 persons are suspected to be infected by Corona, and the samples have been sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune.

If the risk is too small no action is taken,\" he said.\nResponding that the Portuguese authorities are always reviewing risk-based procedures, the Director-General for Health recalled the procedures adopted in the case of influenza A with the first cases that came from Mexico. \"We asked people who came with asymptomatics, who may or may not be incubating the virus, to do voluntary social isolation,\" that is, to stay in a room alone and have minimal contact with people. But, he stressed, \"the initial story is that it will determine the risk and in the light of that risk it is that measures are advised\" of social isolation.\n\"If the Portuguese have already been in their homes in Wuhan in the last 14 days, had no contact with people or animals, have been exposed to nothing, have no symptoms, there is no reason to place them in social isolation,\" said Archbishop FreitaYeah.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new coronavirus has caused more than 900 deaths and has infected over 40.500 people. The numbers should not stop here and even be aggravated by the end of the prolonged Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. To find out which countries the virus can be imported more easily, scientists from Germany have used a computational model. In the case of Portugal, the risk of importing the coronavirus is \"very low\", with the country in the 61st position on the relative risk list for importing the virus. The Health Directorate (DGS) also announced this Monday two more suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus were six so far, and one of them was already negative at the beginning of the night. The second suspicious case, which had been referred to the University Hospital Centre of San Juan in Porto, it also had a negative result, informed the DGS already this Tuesday, a few minutes after midnight.\nCases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in more than twenty countries. Even if the vast majority of cases are limited to China, there is still concern that they may spread further around the world. In order to assess the risk of importing cases to other countries, a team from the Humboldt University of Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute, both in Germany, used a computational model, considering the distribution of confirmed cases in China and the 4000 airport air transport network and more than 50.000 air routes. Airport closures due to the epidemic have already been included in the model.\nIt was concluded that Thailand (in addition to China) is the country most likely to have people arriving from one of the airports analysed with coronavirus. This list follows Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Cambodia. The first European country on this list is Germany, which is in 18th placeYeah. Although Angola is on the list of 13 African countries with top priority for the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the fight against the new coronavirus, it does not include the top-10 of African countries with the highest risk of importation in this model. This top is headed by Ethiopia, followed by Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritius, Reunion, Nigeria and Tunisia. Overall, according to the model, Angola is in 115th place.\n\"Portugal has a very low risk of import,\" says Public Dirk Brockmann of Humboldt University. \"It is in 61.th position with a relative import risk of 0,01%, which is about 20 times smaller than the risk of Germany.\" Nevertheless, while Germany has a risk of 0,2%, Thailand has 2,2%. Dirk Brockmann points out that the purpose of this model is to give an overview of the current situation and be a risk analysis tool that can be used by policy makers and public health authorities. In addition to providing country-specific alerts, the model provides data for specific airports.\nAlthough we've given so much to talk about, we still don't know enough about the new coronavirus. Efforts have not been lacking and scientists around the world have been paying attention to the virus. Among the latest news is the publication of the complete biomolecular code of the virus.\nSamples of the new coronavirus have been processed in laboratories around the world and raw information about the genetic code has been sent to the repository of the United States National Health Institutions. From there, a team from the University of California in Santa Cruz (USA) collected information from 29.903 nucleotides, adenine, timine, cytosine and guanine, the basic chemical elements that make up the DNA molecule, represented by letters A, T, C and G, and made it available in the public database Genome Browser BrowserYeah.\n\"By providing data on coronavirus in the Browser Genome at the University of California in Santa Cruz, this allows investigators to observe the structure of the virus and, more importantly, investigate how they can attack it,\" stated Hiram Clawson, a researcher at that university.\nThe way this coronavirus is transmitted has been another major issue. CoronVirus is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected secretions and aerosols in therapeutic procedures that produce them, DGS states. But how long does it persist on surfaces and how can it be inactivated? Two professors from the Greifswald University Hospital in Germany tried to answer these questions.\nTo find answers, they analyzed studies on coronavirus SARS and MERS. It was found that these viruses could persist on surfaces and remain infectious at room temperature on average between four and five days. \"Low temperatures and high humidity in the air further increase your life span\", says Gunter Kampf in a statement from his institution.\nAs for the inactivation of the various coronaviruses in tests with disinfectant solutions, agents with ethanol, commonly oxygenated water or sodium hypochlorite were found to be effective against coronavirus. If these agents were applied at appropriate concentrations, they would reduce the pathogenic particles from one million to 100 in about one minute. For researchers, these results may be extrapolated to the new coronavirus. \"We analyzed different coronavirus and the results were similar\", says Eike Steinmann.\nThis Tuesday and Wednesday, scientists, public health agency professionals, health ministers and research backers will be meeting in Geneva (Switzerland) to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and coronavirus vaccineYeah. In this meeting organized by the WHO in conjunction with the Global Research Collaboration for the Preparation of Infectious Diseases, we will discuss the origin of the virus, identify knowledge gaps or medical products that should be necessary to minimise the impact of the epidemic. \"The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus,\" says the WHO in communication.\nAn international mission led by the WHO also arrived in China this Monday to investigate the epidemic. Epidemiologists on this mission are trying to better understand how the transmission between people takes place, how the virus spreads in hospitals or why some people are dying.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThis Monday was also marked by the visit of the President of China, Xi Jinping, to various sites in Beijing, notably a community centre, a hospital or disease control centre. Xi Jinping was always seen with a mask and his temperature was measured. At Ditan Hospital, where coronavirus-infected patients are being treated, Xi Jinping even took part in a video conference with health professionals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, which the Chinese President has not yet visited.\nThis is considered a rare public appearance of Xi Jinping during the epidemic and occurred days after the death of doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to warn colleagues about the virus and ended up being punished for spreading rumors. The visit also took place on the day when many Chinese return to work after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year vacation. Therefore, the WHO has already stressed that the number of cases outside China may be just \"the tip of an iceberg\"",

The coordinator of the Intensive Medical and Surgical Care Unit at Pulido Valente Hospital in Lisbon emphasises that, although much remains to be known about this virus, this outbreak must be addressed neither with alarm nor with indifference.\nThis virus surprised the world. Is he, in fact, surprising?\nNot surprising. This is a recurring phenomenon. In the last twenty years alone, the same has happened to the family of this virus twice: in 2002 with SARS-CoV and in 2012 with MERS-CoV. Cyclically, there are viruses that can cross the species barrier, that is, they come out of an animal species and can pass into the human species, causing disease. Now we have the ability to detect this more frequently and monitor it globally.\nWhat is the word on this new coronavirus?\nMost likely, the main host will be the bat and there will or will not have been an intermediate host that allowed the passage to the human being. We also know that it has a gene sequence between 70% to 80% similar to SARS-CoV. The incubation period may go up to four days, but in most patients the onset of symptoms occurred between the seventh and eighth day. Although, according to the data available, it affects more adults and males, evidence has already caused disease in all age groups.\nSo far, according to information from the Chinese authorities, between 20% to 25% of cases are associated with pneumonia and between 10% to 15% linked to respiratory distress syndrome. What characterizes these clinical charts? According to data published in \"The Lancet\", a large majority have a high fever followed by a dry coughYeah. Some patients develop into shortness of breath and other respiratory difficulties. There is a small percentage of patients who may have diarrhoea, but it is lower than that found in other outbreaks such as MERS-CoV.\nWe do not yet know much information or whether this applies to different populations in China. We have found that there are only mortality and serious cases in China. So far, none of the cases in Europe, the USA and Canada are serious and no one has died. SARS-CoV had a 10% mortality rate, which is very significant. So far, the new coronavirus is either 3 or 4%.\nMost of the coronavirus strains circulate between animals and never infect humans. I wonder what happened here.\nWhat is normal in nature has happened: there was a virus that managed to find a key to connecting to a human recipient. If there are situations of close proximity to animals, probably diseased animals, this will allow the inhalation of a large viral load from the animal to the human and conditions for the virus to replicate. As it is a completely new virus for humans, it has the ability to trigger diseases.\nThe virulence associated with diversity between animal species makes the virus, at least at the beginning, more difficult to transmit between humans. As it adapts, it transmits more, but it loses some characteristics that differentiate it from the virus that had [initially] infected humans. Generally, the process of adapting a virus that passes from the animal world to humans goes this way. But there is always unpredictability and its evolution can only be documented in the end. At the moment, we are dealing with a situation of unpredictability in the evolution of the new coronavirus.\nWhat are the reasons for this outbreak in China?\nChina has a huge size and represents a huge population share with different population groupYeah. Food habits include the ingestion of many different animals and markets where live animals can be sold and purchased. All this provides for situations of greater proximity and risk of exposure that do not occur in other countries.\nHow is transmission between humans taking place?\nIt is now confirmed that there is effective transmission between humans and that in some cases this happened before people showed symptoms.\nWhat cells does it affect?\nThe cells in the respiratory system. The main binding element to enter the cells is probably a receptor called ACE2, which is a more prevalent receptor in the lower respiratory tract. This may explain the largest number of cases of pneumonias and serious forms that may occur (but with less ease of transmission). But we don't know if there'll be another receiver. If there is to be easier transmission, more complaints on the upper airways and less serious cases, there has to be another type of receiver, or else all this happens in people with a higher proportion of ACE2 on the upper airways.\nIs this virus really more infectious than SARS-CoV?\nAt the moment, I'm not sure we have the knowledge to say that. We do not yet know the actual number of infected people or the whole scale of the problem in China. With regard to the number of cases in China, there are a few significant cases in Europe, the USA or Canada. If it were too infectious, what happened to SARS-CoV in these countries would be predictable, when there was a huge outbreak in Canada.\nAt what stage can it be more contagious?\nIt's probably somewhere between the tenth and 12th day. More or less, this will take place two to four days after complaints have been lodged.\nAre there people who may be more capable of contagion?\nIn SARS-CoV, there were people who had the particularity of being able to transmit the virus with the highest viral amount: it was the super-disseminatorYeah. This is not yet documented in the new coronavirus, but it may explain that some people may have had more ability to infect others and in pre-symptomatic periods. This may have been the case in Germany: a superdisseminater [of Chinese nationality] had a meeting on day 21 [with the person who infected] and began to have symptoms on day 23. The infected people in Germany began to complain on day 27 and 28. In principle, it would be asymptomatic or perhaps it had a very slight form of symptoms that it did not value. All this needs to be analyzed. I think it is important that we are looking at what is happening in China, but the situation in Germany will be important in terms of knowledge, and European cases will be fundamental in order to supplement the information available and that comes from China.\nChina has been praised for the rapid sequencing of the genome and for the transparency of data. You learn from SARS-CoV?\nMany times, praise is related to what happened precisely in the past with SARS, where there has been censorship and information blocking. China has even learned one simple thing: no isolated country has the capacity to deal with an outbreak on this scale. We are much more capable of responding, analysing and understanding when we work in a network and with transparency.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has been reluctant to declare a global public health emergency. Why?\nThe WHO is very well evaluating what is happening in order to make the most appropriate decision in terms of benefit to control the outbreak and minimise the damage that such measures may have. Declaring a global emergency has very big implications in terms of travel restrictions or trade restrictions. The WHO must ponder according to the knowledge and gravity of the situation, and it has done well: these decisions must be taken in the most measured and rational way possible without alarm or indifferenceYeah.\nBut is it inevitable?\nWhat will happen is unpredictable due to the evolution of the virus and the behavior of the people. There are different levels of risk. The risk of a country with direct and closer flights to China is different from that of a country that does not have them.\nWhat is the risk in Portugal?\nIt's not null and void. We live in a global world, and there may be a case. We must be prepared to detect it early and minimise the risk of transmission in the community.\nAre we ready?\nAt this stage, we are. In theory, we're always prepared. In practice, we won't know until we have an affair.\nWhat do you think of China's measures, like the quarantines?\nChina is showing a great intention in trying to control the outbreak. At the moment, what has been done by the Chinese authorities has been effective in the least case transmission out of China.\nWhat about the repatriation of the Portuguese in Wuhan and the non-compulsory isolation?\nWhen the Portuguese arrive and according to the knowledge at the time, the necessary measures will be adapted. What may now seem inadequate to us may be appropriate or inappropriate with what we know at the time. I assume that many of these patients will want to be in isolation to avoid infecting their nearest patients. In Portugal, it is the Directorate-General for Health that coordinates this process and has so far coordinated well. I'd also proven that in the influenza A pandemic and the Legionella outbreak. If there were any doubt about the importance of a strong National Health Service, these outbreaks would absolutely dispel it.\nWhat further measures should be taken?\nThe most important measures will be the development of specific drugs and a vaccine. Some patients with HIV infection, lopinavir and ritonavir, as well as remdesivir, are experienced in specific drugs. Others will probably even have to be trieYeah. There are doubts about the importance and interest of certain types of medicinal products, particularly corticosteroids, because they have an exaggerated response from the immune system and it is even known that influenza can be harmful. To treat these patients, we need information quickly.\nSome lines of vaccine research also resumed work done for SARS-CoV. But a vaccine has yet to be tested in terms of effectiveness and safety. The most useful would be a vaccine for a common part of these viruses in order to avoid these outbreaks in the future.\nHow are patients being treated?\nWith organ support therapy, which we use in many other diseases. What we do is we maintain homeostasis of the patient, often through drugs or devices that ensure the function of the organ, in order to give the body time to recover. For example, when the lung is no longer capable of gaseous exchange, we ensure these exchanges through the ventilator. In doing so, we give the lung time to repair itself in order to progressively assume its physiology. If there's a specific drug, we'll have a much easier life.\nIs this how possible patients will be treated in Portugal?\nAt present, what is available in Portugal are intensive care units with organ support therapy and isolation to avoid the risk of transmission either for visits or family members.\nHow can science prepare us for these outbreaks?\nIt is thought that between two to three microorganisms a year emerge or reemerge with the ability to cause disease in humans. We now have means of diagnosis, monitoring and surveillance that allow us to more frequently detect these episodes and monitor them on a global scale. In the case of Legionella, where the first cases appeared in 1975, the bacterium was only identified almost a year later. Now we've had the ability to detect the virus and sequenc e it in weeksYeah. Anything that can be done to improve diagnostic, monitoring and action methods will enable us to detect more of these situations.\nHow can this virus be stopped?\nThe risk of infections with early emerging or reemergent microorganisms is perpetual. This will be a permanent risk to humanity. Now we have a greater capacity to characterize [the viruses]. Every now and then, microorganisms have the ability to cause disease by a mechanism of novelty, emergency or reemergence. We must get used to it and realise that this can happen without alarm or indifference, but with action and knowledge.\nCan we get to a pandemic?\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAnything is possible.\nHow can we prepare?\nMaintain surveillance networks and learn from previous episodes in order to create more knowledge and new tools",

        "news_content_translate_en": "1/GIVE NO QUARTER  \n Few will regret the end of the first 2020 quarter. Fears of a U.S.-Iran war gave way to the coronavirus pandemic which JPMorgan reckons will have pushed the world economy into a 12% contraction over January to March. The quarter saw the most brutal global equity collapse since the Great Depression, exacerbated by a 60% oil price slump.  \n April may not bring much relief, with coronavirus still spreading rapidly and keeping large parts of the global economy shuttered. Banks have rushed to slash Q2 forecasts too, so expect more turbulence on financial markets.  \n The cavalry has arrived though. G20 governments have promised a $5 trillion revival effort, major central banks have slashed rates and restarted asset purchases. Markets have bounced big and may actually end Q1 on a high. What we need now is to see infection rates peaking and that will show whether April falls, or if it's indeed time for spring.  \n  \n (Graphic: World stocks vs. COVID-19 confirmed cases, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4023/3979/msci.png)  \n  \n 2/PANDEMIC PAYROLLS:  \n Through years of stubbornly low economic growth and inflation, the brightest spot was the U.S. labour market, with unemployment reaching half-century lows. Coronavirus may have ended that boom.  \n With infections surging, cities in lockdown, businesses downing shutters and most travel on ice, staff layoffs are likely to mushroom. That showed up in the number of Americans filing unemployment benefit claims which hit a record of more than 3 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though some estimates were as high as 4 million.  \n Now the wait is on for Friday's non-farm payrolls figures that will offer a snapshot of the jobs picture over March. The government's unprecedented $2 trillion fiscal expansion package includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount to fund direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to U.S. families.  \n Economists expect the payroll data to show a loss of 293,000 jobs - the largest monthly drop since July 2009. A significant overshoot of that and the $2 trillion stimulus approved by Congress could suddenly start to look inadequate.  \n  \n (Graphic: Pandemic payrolls, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3945/3901/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 3/CHINA'S PYRRHIC VICTORY  \n The world's factory is re-opening, but the market is closed and the shoppers are gone.  \n China's social isolation policies appear to have contained the coronavirus at home, allowing work and travel to resume. But major economic damage may be yet to come. With infections climbing exponentially in the United States, Europe and the other markets China exports to, and with supply chains in disarray, China is getting neither the imported components it needs nor demand for its products.  \n Already Chinese factories' Jan-Feb profits have hit their lowest in a decade and upcoming manufacturing surveys will very likely reveal more pain. And just like everywhere else, job losses are mounting up, regardless of how many cheap loans are being offered to businesses. Expectations are now for the economy to contract this quarter but many economists reckon 2020 growth will be around 2% - a third of the \"around 6%\" authorities target.  \n  \n (Graphic: China's Industrial profits shrinking, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/9258/9170/Pasted%20Image.jpg)  \n  \n 4/COME TOGETHER, RIGHT NOW  \n The European Central Bank has done its bit to tackle the virus damage, having massively expanded asset purchases, agreed to more flexibility on the share of bonds it buys from each country and buffered borrowing costs for weaker euro zone states such as Italy. Now it's up to European Union leaders to come together.  \n So far there is no united front: they've failed to agree on the scale of support for economies ravaged by the outbreak. The ECB's aggressive action gives them some breathing space but, as of now, politicians are wrangling over setting up a credit line worth some 2% of annual output from the euro area bailout fund.  \n Many European governments urge the issuance of a joint debt instrument to face a crisis which Goldman Sachs economists estimate may shrink the euro economy by 9% this year. But Germany and some others oppose that. At stake, says France's Emmanuel Macron, is the survival of the European project. The crisis, for sure, is far from over.  \n  \n (Graphic: 10-year bond yield spreads over Germany, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/4030/3986/DE2703.png)  \n  \n 5/FRONTIERS ON THE EDGE  \n It's been a tough time for riskier assets in recent weeks, including emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies. But few have felt the pain as much as frontier markets, a subset of smaller and often riskier emerging economies.  \n Many of those frontier economies are in Africa, and are suffering from a toxic combination of tumbling oil and commodity prices, the prospect of the global economy tumbling into recession and weakening currencies which will make servicing external debt ever-more expensive.  \n Oil-producing countries like Angola, Ghana, Gabon and Nigeria have seen their dollar-denominated debt drop sharply, with yields of some issues shooting above 20%, indicating soaring borrowing costs. Many countries on the continent lack the financial firepower or foreign currency reserves needed to combat the coronavirus and prop up their economies, with healthcare systems already under strain.  \n The World Bank and International Monetary Fund on Wednesday urged official bilateral creditors to provide immediate debt relief to the world's poorest countries as they grapple with the human and economic consequences of the pandemic.  \n Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies pledged on Thursday to inject over $5 trillion into the global economy to limit job and income losses from the coronavirus and \"do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic\", expressing concern about Africa in particular. Many hope that the acknowledgement of the need to bolster global financial safety nets and national health systems will translate into action.  \n  \n (Graphic: Africa's soaring borrowing costs, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3971/3927/Africa's%20soaring%20borrowing%20costs.jpg) REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK — As the number of people infected with the coronavirus surpasses 450,000 worldwide, and more than 1 billion are locked in their homes, scientists are wrestling with one of the most pressing questions of the pandemic: Do people who survive the infection become immune to the virus? \n The answer is a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns. That’s important for several reasons. \n People who are confirmed to be immune could venture from their homes and help shore up the workforce until a vaccine becomes available, for example. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for the severely ill. \n Growing immunity in the community also is the way the epidemic ends: With fewer and fewer people to infect, the coronavirus will lose its toehold and even the most vulnerable citizens become more insulated from the threat. \n Immunity may also bring an early treatment. Antibodies gathered from the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called Covid-19. \n On Tuesday (March 24), the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. A day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York would become the first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from Covid-19 to treat those who are seriously ill. \n “It’s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York’s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,” Mr Cuomo said. \n The body’s first line of defence against an infectious virus is an antibody called immunoglobulin M, whose job is to stay vigilant in the body and alert the rest of the immune system to intruders like viruses and bacteria. \n Days into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a second type, called immunoglobulin G, exquisitely designed to recognise and neutralize a specific virus. \n The refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the potency of the final antibodies can vary. Some people make powerful neutralising antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder response. \n The antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses — polio or measles, for example — bestow a lifetime of immunity. But antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for just one to three years — and that may be true of their new cousin as well. \n A study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that once infected, the monkeys produce neutralising antibodies and resist further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people infected with the virus, will remain immune. \n Most people who became infected during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic — that virus is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called Sars-CoV-2 — had long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said Dr Vineet D. Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. \n Those who recovered from Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), another coronavirus, saw much shorter-term protection, Dr Menachery said. People who have been infected with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two years, he added: “Beyond that, we can’t predict.” \n Still, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people become reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be much milder than the first, said Dr Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \n Even after the body stops producing neutralising antibodies, a subset of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted. \n “You probably would make a good immune response before you even become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the disease,” Dr Krammer said. \n A crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the virus until a vaccine is available. \n Dr Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients and health care workers. \n The researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100 people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses known to cause the common cold. \n If those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus, too, Dr Koopmans said, it might explain why some people — children, for example — have only mild symptoms. They may have antibodies to related coronaviruses that are at last somewhat effective against the new one. \n The quickest way to assess immunity is a blood test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test. \n Antibody tests are used in Singapore, China and a handful of other countries. But they are just coming to market in much of the West. \n Last week, Dr Krammer and his colleagues developed one such antibody test that could be scaled up in “days to weeks”, he said. \n The team validated the test in blood plasma taken from three patients with Covid-19. The researchers are seeking speedy approval from the FDA. \n Dozens of other labs are also at work on a dizzying list of tests, although they, too, are mostly based on slim data that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. \n “No matter who makes them, as long as they’re reliable, that’s a super nice tool,” Dr Krammer said. Because this is a new coronavirus, the test should deliver “basically, a yes or no answer, like an HIV test — you can figure out who was exposed and who wasn’t”. \n On Wednesday, officials of Public Health England said they had purchased millions of newly developed antibody tests and were evaluating them for patients to use at home. Citizens who discovered they had been exposed and now had some immunity to the coronavirus might be able to return to normal lives, the officials said. \n That would be particularly useful for health care workers. Those who know they have at least some immunity could be placed on the front lines of emergency care, sparing colleagues who have not been exposed. \n “If this really goes on for months at a time, for 18 months as some people have projected, having health care workers who are immune to the virus will be really, really helpful,” said Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. \n But tests like these may not be of much use for diagnosis of coronavirus infection as it gets underway, because of the time it takes for the body to begin producing antibodies. \n Dr Krammer’s test picks up an antibody response as early as three days after symptoms emerge. Given that people may not show symptoms for as long as 14 days after infection, however, that is too late for the test to be useful as a diagnostic tool. \n Finding people with powerful antibody responses might help point the way to new treatments, however. Essentially, antibodies extracted from the blood of recovered patients are injected into those who are ill. \n Several teams have already been working on such an effort, following early reports from China of success. A Beijing-based company called AnyGo Technology has provided 50,000 tests to the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and to hospitals in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, according to its founder, Dr Le Sun. \n Dr Shangen Zheng, a doctor with the Chinese military, said his team had treated more than 10 patients so far, and data from many more patients treated with plasma in Hubei province is being assessed. \n This approach is actually “something very old-fashioned”, Dr Krammer said. It was used to save American soldiers infected with the hemorrhagic Hantaan virus during the Korean War, and to treat people in Argentina infected with the hemorrhagic Junin virus. \n Before the method can be put into wide use, however, scientists must work out safety issues, such as ensuring that the plasma taken from recovered patients is free of other viruses and toxins. \n Pharmaceutical companies like Takeda and Regeneron are hoping to sidestep some of those questions by developing antibodies against the coronavirus in the laboratory. \n Ultimately, it is only with these tests that scientists will be able to say when enough of the population has been infected and has become immune — and when the virus has begun to run out of hosts.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "纽约-随着全球感染冠状病毒的人数超过45万人，超过10亿人被锁在家中，科学家们正在努力解决这一流行病最紧迫的问题之一：在感染后存活的人是否对病毒免疫？\n答案是肯定的，但有一些重大的未知数。这很重要，有几个原因。\n例如，被证实免疫的人可以从家里冒险出来，帮助支撑劳动力，直到疫苗问世。特别是，已知免疫的医护人员可以继续护理重病患者。\n社区中不断增长的免疫力也是这种流行病的终结方式：随着感染者越来越少，冠状病毒将失去其立足点，甚至最脆弱的公民也会变得更加远离威胁。\n免疫也可能带来早期治疗。从康复者体内收集的抗体可用于帮助那些与冠状病毒（Covid-19）引起的疾病作斗争的人。\n周二（3月24日），美国食品药品监督管理局批准使用康复患者血浆治疗一些重症患者。一天前，纽约州州长安德鲁库莫宣布，纽约州将成为第一个开始检测从Covid-19恢复的人血清的州，以治疗那些身患重病的人。\n库莫表示：“这是一项针对病情严重者的试验，但纽约州卫生部一直在与纽约一些最好的医疗机构合作，我们认为这显示出了希望。”。\n人体抵御感染性病毒的第一道防线是一种名为免疫球蛋白M的抗体，其职责是保持体内警惕，并提醒免疫系统的其他部分注意病毒和细菌等入侵者.\n感染几天后，免疫系统将这种抗体提炼成第二种类型，称为免疫球蛋白G，设计精巧，可识别和中和特定病毒。\n精制过程可能需要长达一周的时间；最终抗体的制备过程和效力都可能不同。有些人对感染产生强大的中和抗体，而另一些人则产生较温和的反应。\n对某些病毒（如小儿麻痹症或麻疹）的感染产生的抗体，可产生终生免疫。但是，导致普通感冒的冠状病毒抗体只持续了一到三年——他们的新表亲也可能是这样。\n一项对感染新冠状病毒的猕猴的研究表明，一旦感染，猕猴产生中和抗体并抵抗进一步的感染。但目前尚不清楚这些猴子或感染病毒的人还能免疫多久。\n德克萨斯大学加尔维斯顿分校的病毒学家维内特·德梅纳赫里博士说，大多数在非典（严重急性呼吸系统综合征）流行期间被感染的人——这种病毒是新型冠状病毒（Sars-CoV-2）的近亲——具有8至10年的长期免疫力。\n梅纳赫里博士说，那些从另一种冠状病毒中东呼吸综合征（Mers）中康复的人看到的是短期的保护。他补充说，感染新冠状病毒的人可能拥有至少一到两年的免疫力：“除此之外，我们无法预测。”\n不过，纽约西奈山伊坎医学院微生物学家弗洛里安·克莱默博士说，即使抗体保护持续时间很短，人们再次受到感染，第二轮与冠状病毒的较量可能会比第一轮温和得多。\n他指出，即使人体停止产生中和抗体，免疫记忆细胞的一个子集也能有效地重新激活一种反应.\n克拉默博士说：“在你再次出现症状之前，你可能会有一个很好的免疫反应，可能真的会减缓疾病的进程。”。\n一个关键的问题是，只有轻微症状的儿童和成人是否仍能产生足够强的反应，在获得疫苗之前对病毒保持免疫。\n鹿特丹伊拉斯谟大学（Erasmus University）的病毒学家马里恩•库普曼斯（Marion Koopmans）博士和她的团队已经对15名感染患者和医护人员进行了抗体反应筛查。\n研究人员还使用了大约100名已知感染了四种常见感冒冠状病毒之一的人的血样。\n库普曼斯博士说，如果这些样本也显示出对新冠状病毒的某种免疫反应，这或许可以解释为什么有些人——例如儿童——只有轻微症状。他们可能对相关的冠状病毒有抗体，这些抗体最终对新的冠状病毒有一定的效果。\n评估免疫力的最快方法是血液测试，在康复者的血液中寻找保护性抗体。但首先你得做个测试。\n抗体检测在新加坡、中国和其他一些国家也有应用。但它们刚刚在西方大部分地区上市。\n他说，上周，克莱默博士和他的同事开发了一种这样的抗体测试方法，可以在“几天到几周”内扩大规模。\n研究小组对三名Covid-19患者的血浆进行了验证。研究人员正在寻求FDA的迅速批准。\n其他数十个实验室也在进行一系列令人眼花缭乱的测试，尽管它们也大多是基于其他科学家尚未审查过的微弱数据。\n克莱默博士说：“不管是谁制造的，只要它们可靠，这是一个非常好的工具。”。因为这是一种新的冠状病毒，测试应该提供“基本上，一个是或否的答案，就像艾滋病毒测试-你可以找出谁暴露了谁没有”.\n星期三，英国公共卫生部官员说，他们已经购买了数以百万计的新开发的抗体测试，并正在对其进行评估，供病人在家使用。官员们说，发现自己已经暴露在外，现在对冠状病毒有了一定免疫力的市民或许能够恢复正常生活。\n这对医疗工作者尤其有用。那些知道自己至少有一些免疫力的人可以被安排在紧急护理的第一线，不让那些没有被暴露的同事受到伤害。\n纽约哥伦比亚大学（Columbia University）的病毒学家安吉拉·拉斯穆森博士（Dr Angela Rasmussen）说：“如果这种情况一次持续几个月，就像一些人预测的那样持续18个月，那么拥有对病毒免疫的医护人员将真的非常有帮助。”。\n但在冠状病毒感染的诊断过程中，像这样的测试可能没有多大用处，因为人体需要很长时间才能开始产生抗体。\n克莱默博士的测试在症状出现后三天就发现了抗体反应。然而，考虑到人们在感染后14天内可能不会出现症状，这对于作为诊断工具的检测来说已经太迟了。\n然而，找到抗体反应强烈的人可能有助于为新的治疗指明方向。基本上，从康复病人血液中提取的抗体被注射到病人体内。\n在中国早期的成功报道之后，已经有几个团队在进行这样的努力。据其创始人孙乐博士介绍，一家总部位于北京的公司AnyGo Technology已经为中国疾病预防控制中心以及武汉、北京和上海的医院提供了5万项检测。\n中国军队的医生郑尚根博士说，到目前为止，他的团队已经治疗了10多个病人，来自湖北省更多接受血浆治疗的病人的数据正在进行评估.\n克莱默博士说，这种方法实际上是“非常过时的”。它被用来拯救在朝鲜战争期间感染出血性汉坦病毒的美国士兵，以及治疗阿根廷感染出血性朱宁病毒的人。\n然而，在该方法能够广泛应用之前，科学家必须解决安全问题，例如确保从康复患者身上提取的血浆不含其他病毒和毒素。\n像武田和瑞金隆这样的制药公司希望通过在实验室开发抗冠状病毒的抗体来回避其中的一些问题。\n最终，只有通过这些测试，科学家们才能确定何时有足够的人群被感染并获得免疫，以及何时病毒已经开始从宿主中消失。纽约时报",

        "news_content_translate_en": "CARACAS - On March 13, Melquiades Avila, an indigenous leader and journalist in the remote Venezuelan state of Delta Amacuro, asked on his popular Facebook account: \"Will our hospital be ready for coronavirus?\"  \n Earlier that week, as Venezuela confirmed its first infections by the novel coronavirus, President Nicolas Maduro's health ministry on its website had listed Delta Amacuro's Luis Razetti Hospital as one of 46 medical centres \"prepared\" to receive COVID-19 patients.  \n Avila enumerated various reasons, all confirmed by Reuters in interviews with physicians at the hospital, why the claim was false: The facility has no blood pressure monitors, syringes, or reagents to diagnose coronavirus infections.  \n \"What a joke,\" Avila wrote.  \n A day later, Lizeta Hernandez, governor of Delta Amacuro and a member of the ruling Socialist party, called on local radio for Avila's arrest, accusing him of \"inciting hatred\" and denouncing him as \"criminal.\" She ordered the state Army deployment to detain Avila \"so that I can give him a masterclass in the meaning of public duty.\"  \n In a voice message to Reuters, the governor this week said she only wanted to \"orient\" Avila and ensure he was being \"serious and responsible\" as a journalist. She declined to answer questions about the hospital, its readiness or previous clashes with Avila, who for years has criticized health care in the state.  \n Raquel Ruiz, the hospital director, denied the facility is unprepared. State authorities, she added, are readying a nearby building to treat coronavirus patients.  \n The threat against Avila, who is now in hiding but spoke with Reuters by telephone, is one of at least seven recent episodes in which Venezuelan authorities have sought to arrest critics of the government's preparedness for the coronavirus, according to interviews with three accused individuals and lawyers of four others.  \n In addition to Avila, police have arrested an opposition lawmaker who tweeted – correctly, according to health workers from the facility – that another hospital on the \"prepared\" list has no running water. Police also arrested a retired medical technician who in a video said a hospital in Monagas state was unprepared.  \n Officials from Venezuela's health, justice and information ministries didn't respond to requests for comment about the detentions, conditions at the hospitals or police involvement in the coronavirus response.  \n Even in normal circumstances, dissent can subject citizens to arrest, prison sentences or worse in Venezuela, where aggressive security policies have prompted Western democracies to sanction the government for human rights abuses. Now, government opponents say the coronavirus offers a new opportunity for Maduro to crack down.  \n In China, where the current outbreak began, government efforts to quash early warnings about the virus may have helped it spread, public health experts have said. China denies any such cover-ups happened.  \n Maduro's critics fear the same may happen in Venezuela, where poverty, hunger and a shortage of basic medical supplies complicated health care even before the pandemic. \"The government is trying to hide the truth,\" says Humberto Prado, who heads a human rights commission for opposition legislators. \"If you talk, they'll arrest and silence you.\"  \n  \n \"NARNIA WORLD\"  \n As of late Tuesday, Venezuela has confirmed 91 COVID-19 cases and no deaths.  \n More than 20 doctors and public health specialists told Reuters they fear the toll could mount quickly despite a show of force that the government says should contain the outbreak. Some of its measures are not unlike the enforced lockdowns imposed by some U.S. states and Western European nations.  \n But the forces carrying out the tasks in Venezuela have long been associated with corruption and extralegal violence. The National Police's feared Special Action Force, accused by citizens and government critics of extrajudicial killings and torture, patrols streets.  \n Intelligence agents now guard sites ranging from supermarkets to the Caracas medical institute tasked with coronavirus testing. At some roadblocks, police and soldiers have shaken down medical workers before letting them get to or from work, according to 12 doctors and nurses interviewed by Reuters.  \n One physician said she paid the equivalent of a week's salary at a checkpoint in the central city of Maracay. \"The officers weren't going to let me pass,\" she said.  \n Police officials in Maracay didn't respond to a request by Reuters to discuss the incident. Regional military leaders, who also staff checkpoints, referred Reuters to the defence ministry in Caracas. Officials at the defence ministry didn't return phone calls or emails requesting comment.  \n Some police, acting on tips from neighbourhood informants, are accompanying government medics to poor neighbourhoods and forcing individuals with suspected coughs or other illnesses to get examinations, people familiar with the operations said. The administration this week said security forces had visited over 18,000 homes.  \n Meanwhile, the government is keeping private physicians from conducting diagnoses, senior doctors told Reuters, centralizing all testing at the National Hygiene Institute, a Caracas facility that passes results directly to the health ministry.  \n Earlier this month, the ministry stopped coronavirus testing at Caracas' private El Avila Clinic, two medical workers familiar with the order said. On March 13, one of these people said, government workers went to the clinic and confiscated testing materials.  \n Vicente Marzullo, the clinic's director, didn't respond to efforts by Reuters to discuss the government's measures there.  \n Avila, the 54-year-old journalist in Delta Amacuro, has angered government officials before. A member of the native Warao tribe, Avila has chronicled growing health challenges for indigenous peoples during Venezuela's economic collapse.  \n In 2018, he broadcast on local radio a Warao woman saying relatives were dying because of a lack of medicines. Hernandez, the governor, stormed into his office afterward and accused him of spreading lies, Avila said.  \n Four physicians at the hospital on Maduro's coronavirus list told Reuters that Avila's warnings are accurate. The doctors, who asked not to be identified, said the hospital has none of the materials Avila mentioned and that, crucially, it has no ventilators, which have been vital in other countries to help COVID-19 patients breathe.  \n \"Mr. Avila's comments weren't lies,\" one senior doctor said. \"The government lives in a Narnia world,\" alluding to the classic fantasy epics of C.S. Lewis.  \n  \n \"A DANGEROUS PERSON\"  \n Health-care workers in nine additional states told Reuters that other hospitals on the list are also deficient.  \n The Leopoldo Manrique Terrero Hospital, in the Coche district of Caracas, isn't even open to patients. It hasn't functioned as a clinical facility for at least three years, two maintenance workers there said. Reuters was unable to identify a director for the hospital or a working telephone number for administrative offices.  \n In northeastern Monagas state, medical personnel have been so concerned about a lack of preparedness for COVID-19 that they filmed a protest outside the Manuel Nunez Tovar Hospital, another facility on the list.  \n Darwin Moreno, the hospital's director, in a brief telephone conversation this week said he could discuss the incident later in the day. He didn't return follow-up phone calls or messages.  \n In the video, filmed March 13 and seen by Reuters, Julio Molinos, a retired technician and medical union leader, urged the health ministry to be transparent. The video, shared widely through chat groups, reached authorities.  \n On March 15, officers from the Special Action Force, or FAES, arrested Molinos, according to two lawyers defending him. FAES administrators didn't respond to a Reuters request for comment on the arrest.  \n Last week, a judge placed Molinos, 72, under house arrest on charges of conspiracy and inciting hatred and panic. Jose Sosa, one of his lawyers, denied the charges and called Molinos a \"political prisoner.\"  \n In the southeastern state of Bolivar, Tony Geara, an opposition lawmaker, in a March 14 Twitter thread wrote that \"there isn't even water\" at the local Ruiz y Paez Hospital. Three workers there told Reuters the facility hasn't had running water for the past five years and relies on trucks to deliver it.  \n Reuters was unable to reach hospital directors for comment.  \n Hours after Geara's tweets, agents from the SEBIN intelligence agency stopped the lawmaker at a roadblock, according to a report by the agency reviewed by Reuters. He was arrested and remains in police custody.  \n At a court hearing last week, prosecutors charged Geara, 58, with possession of explosives and trafficking weapons. The SEBIN report contains a photo of an agent pointing to an automatic rifle on the road where Geara was arrested. Agents said the rifle was in Geara's vehicle, according to the report.  \n SEBIN officials didn't respond to a Reuters request for comment. Simon Andarcia, Geara's lawyer, said the lawmaker denied the charges and accused agents of planting the weapon.  \n Three colleagues from Geara's Popular Will party said SEBIN operatives had been tracking him recently, photographing him at political events.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — On a typical humid night, Ms Justine Victoria would be weaving in and out of crowds of tourists around the Merlion Park, serving her customers with something cold and refreshing. \n The 27-year-old manager of J-Cone Jipangyi, an ice cream cafe located near the iconic tourist symbol that gives the park its name, told TODAY of the many nationalities that would stand by the railings facing Marina Bay Sands, waiting for the nightly light show to begin. \n But the light shows have stopped, and the once busy promenade is now virtually empty — save for a handful of Singaporeans taking an after-dinner stroll. \n Since February, tourists who recently visited mainland China have been barred from entering the city, in a bid to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 disease. This temporary travel ban was extended to all other tourists on Sunday (March 22). \n Many businesses that rely on tourism to turn a profit told TODAY that they have seen a dramatic drop in patronage. \n Some are adopting a wait-and-see approach to determine how they will ride out the slump, while others have cut the wages of their senior staff. \n Ms Victoria, who is from the Philippines, said that she has never seen business this quiet in the three years she has worked at the cafe. \n She had not served a single table in the five hours prior to speaking with TODAY at about 9pm on March 17. \n Ms Victoria is now worried about her job security, and noted that her compatriots at the Singapore River Cruise were recently let go because of the decline in tourist arrivals. \n In response to queries from TODAY, the Singapore River Cruise confirmed that they had to let go of a few of their Filipino employees, though it did not state the exact number. \n Mr See Toh Yew Leong, the firm’s general manager, said other measures included reducing the number of hours which boat captains work. \n He said the company is also taking the opportunity to send their staff for skills upgrading. \n One of its boat captains, a 33-year-old Singaporean man who declined to be named, said he was glad he still has a job. Still, he is worried about how he will support his two young children as his typical 12-hour days have been reduced to about six hours a day. \n “We definitely rely on tourists. Singaporeans may have taken this ride before and aren’t likely to return again,” he said. \n MIXED APPROACH BY SINGAPORE ATTRACTIONS \n At the river’s end at Marina Bay Sands (MBS), several tenants faced a similar plight. \n Fashion retailer Philipp Plein said locals account for only about 30 per cent of its clientele, and business has dropped by at least 20 per cent since Chinese New Year. \n The retailer’s vice president of operations and marketing, Mr Adrian Lim, said Chinese tourists form for the bulk of their overseas customers. \n “Now the strategy will have to change. We will have to focus a little more on the local market,” said Mr Lim. \n  \n Shoppers were scarce at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands on March 24, 2020. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/ TODAY \n In a statement to TODAY, an MBS spokesperson said the company is “actively assisting (the) retailers during the ongoing Covid-19 situation”. \n The spokesperson said that various measures, including rental rebates, rent payment instalment plans, shorter trading hours and additional marketing support, have been “rolled out progressively in a targeted and tiered manner”. The assistance is dependent on sales, with priority given to distributors and local retailers. \n “We are working hand in hand with retailers to boost foot traffic to the mall and roll out a full suite of tactical marketing measures and shopping incentives catering to a wide range of demographic groups across our different retail categories,” said the spokesperson. \n While the mall was generally quiet on the several occasions TODAY visited, employees at the adjoining casino said they have been kept busy with mostly Singaporean patrons. \n Aside from the recently implemented safe distancing measures within the casino, a 62-year-old croupier, who declined to be named, said it has been “business as usual”. \n Still, he said his colleagues are anxious. Another croupier, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lau, 40, was among those who was worried about his job security.   \n At the nearby Gardens by the Bay in the afternoon on March 24, TODAY saw few, if any, visitors strolling along the bridges of the popular Supertree Observatory. \n When asked how they were dealing with managing their operating costs, a spokesperson for Gardens by the Bay said: “Given the rapidly evolving circumstances, we are carefully considering the next steps forward that balance social responsibility with our national role as a public garden.” \n  \n There were far fewer visitors than usual at Gardens by the Bay on March 24, 2020. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n Meanwhile, the management team at Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS), which oversees operations at Singapore Zoo, the Night Safari and the River Safari, took a pay cut of up to 15 per cent in early February as one means of reducing operating costs. \n “Disruption to international tourism (during the Covid-19 outbreak) is expected to be a protracted one and our corporate focus is to keep jobs,” said Dr Cheng Wen-Haur, deputy chief executive officer and chief life sciences officer for WRS. \n Dr Cheng said critical functions that oversee animal care are continuing with full resources. \n “But with the sharp decline in park attendance, we have scaled down our food and beverage, retail and ticketing operations,” he said. \n Dr Cheng said visitor numbers have fallen by 60 to 70 per cent over the last two months across WRS’ parks. China, he said, is among WRS’ top markets and makes up 15 per cent of all overseas guests at the parks. \n “In the meantime, we are leveraging the government’s stimulus package for staff training as well as providing boarding and accommodation for our Malaysian colleagues who chose to stay on in Singapore,” he added.  \n At Resort World Sentosa (RWS), visitors were sparse when TODAY visited in the afternoon on March 23. A large section of the underground carpark was empty, with its lights switched off. Some taxi drivers said business has been painfully slow. \n  \n Tourist footfall had visibly decreased around the casino at Resorts World Sentosa on March 24, 2020. Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n TODAY understands that RWS adopts an energy-efficient policy that reduces electricity usage throughout the resort when footfall is low. \n Mr Robert Yong, a manager of Hard Rock Cafe at RWS, said that so far, the only crowd he has seen recently was when the joint held a St Patrick’s Day promotion. \n The promotion, which ended on March 22, gave diners a free beer with every burger purchase. It was “very well received”, said Mr Yong. \n Still, with the exception of the recent March school holidays, he said business has been bad. \n “RWS has extended their promotions to this weekend, but look at the place now. There’s nobody around,” said Mr Yong. \n  \n Universal Studios at Resorts World Sentosa was fairly deserted on March 24, 2020. Photo: Yong Jun Yuan/TODAY \n RWS had not responded by 9pm on March 24 to questions about how the resort was dealing with the health crisis. \n However, according to a Singapore Exchange filing on March 17 by Genting Singapore which operates RWS, the group “is keeping a close watch on the development of the Covid-19 outbreak” and has implemented a reduction in executives’ pay and directors’ fees, as well as adopted certain cost control measures. \n These measures include: \n A 15 per cent reduction in non-executive directors’ fees for the first quarter of this year \n A 18 per cent reduction in the base salary for executive directors \n A 9 to 18 per cent reduction in the base salary for all managerial staff \n Encouraging employees to take no-pay leave and/or annual leave \n EXCEPTIONAL TIMES \n CIMB economist Song Seng Wun said the world is facing “exceptional times”, and Covid-19 will not only negatively impact the entire hospitality chain but also badly affect Singapore’s “tiny open economy”. \n “Covid-19 is pretty bad compared to Sars… It’s a healthcare crisis that might spill over into a financial crisis, and people all over the globe are affected,” he added.  \n Ms Shirley Tee, senior manager at Nanyang Polytechnic’s School of Business Management, said that businesses with high fixed costs, and are not scalable in their operations and business model, will find it tough to survive. \n “We believe that the hardest hit will be the SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) in the tourism industry which might not have the cashflow to tide them through this trying time,” she said. \n Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat will deliver a ministerial statement on March 26 on the Government’s additional support measures for workers, businesses and households in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. \n Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said on March 23 this is the first time that the Government is introducing a supplementary budget “so soon after the main budget, reflecting how fast the situation has deteriorated over the past weeks”. \n During the Budget statement on Feb 18, Mr Heng had unveiled a S$4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package that contained a range of measures to cushion the blow of the virus on local businesses and workers. \n Expecting retrenchments and bankruptcies to pick up if firms are left to fend for themselves, OCBC economist Selena Ling said: “It is not the job of the Government to help all companies survive, but this is an event shock that is coming fast and furious and quickly enveloping the global economy.” \n Ms Tee noted that the tourism industry should \"start exploring means to move towards a lean operation business model to mitigate the impact caused by Covid-19”. Ms Ling agreed, adding: “Even if the pandemic stabilises, it may still take a bit of time for tourism to regain the trust of people.” \n  \n Social distancing was no problem at the Skypark at Marina Bay Sands on March 24, 2020, with few visitors in attendance.

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday opened the door to a radical shift in the U.S. government's relationship to private industry as the coronavirus outbreak upends the nation's economy, saying he would back the government taking stakes in certain companies.  \n Asked if he supported the federal government moving to take an equity stake in some companies, Trump said: \"I do. I really do.\"  \n Trump, speaking at a news conference at the White House, added: \"We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry.\"  \n The White House did not immediately respond when asked if purchasing shares in battered companies was really under consideration. The U.S. government rarely invests in public companies except in the case of bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs.  \n The COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has sickened more than 11,000 people in the United States and killed more than 180, upending American life as it shutters schools, restaurants and businesses across the country.  \n Bailout requests related to the spread of health crisis, in the form of direct grants, loans, loan guarantees and tax relief, have topped $2 trillion. Companies generally do not welcome government ownership for fear they would lose control of their business, however.  \n  \n PRECEDENT  \n Taking stakes in companies is not without precedent in times of crisis.  \n The Bush and Obama administrations loaned the auto industry, including General Motors and Chrysler, which is now controlled by Italy’s Fiat, $80 billion to avoid the collapse of the industry that they felt would result in the loss of millions of U.S. jobs.  \n The U.S. government spent about $50 billion to bail out GM alone. As a result of the company’s 2009 bankruptcy, the government’s investment was converted to a 61 percent equity stake in the Detroit-based automaker, plus preferred shares and a loan. The government no longer has a stake in the company.  \n Just last month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider taking a \"controlling stake\" in Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson to counter China-based Huawei’s dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology.  \n The Trump administration accuses Huawei of being able to spy on customers and has led a global campaign to convince allies to keep the blacklisted company out of their 5G networks.  \n Even if the idea of ownership stakes is ultimately discarded, sweeping measures to mitigate the economic fallout from coronavirus seem inevitable.  \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday urged Congress to pass a $1 trillion economic relief measure by early next week, adding the government was focused on being able to provide liquidity to companies.  \n Asked if a trillion dollar stimulus is enough, Trump said: \"We will know about that later. We'll see what happens. It depends how long, so much depend on what's going on in this room, in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its track the virus, it's plenty.

        "news_content_translate_en": "On Monday (March 16), leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) announced a slew of measures to address the Covid-19 pandemic. The G7’s emphasis was distinctively on coordination and cooperation, with the measures covering information sharing, global economic relief, and public health. \n This can be seen as a lift for the multilateral system, amid the rise of divisive unilateralism among those who do not trust the global governance architecture. But the success of the G7’s actions will depend on how much the world trusts its capacity to handle the crisis. \n Indeed, if there is one word that encapsulates the governance challenge as Covid-19 wreaks havoc globally, it would be the word “trust”. \n Covid-19 has disrupted every aspect of life in affected countries, raised fears, and sparked uncertainties. Yet how people respond reduces to a crucial factor: Trust — or lack thereof — in their neighbours, their healthcare or welfare systems, and their authorities. \n When panic-buying or store runs broke out around the world, a familiar pattern played out over and over: People, facing uncertainty and fear, sought safety in stockpiling. \n Economists who study bank runs are familiar with this pattern: It illustrates an underlying logic of self-preservation amid uncertainty — and a lack of trust in the system to prevail. \n Yet individually-rational actions can lead to systemically-irrational outcomes, or in laymen’s terms: Panic. \n Making sure that a system is fit to meet people’s needs in a crisis — and then persuading them of such — must therefore be one of the major aspects of tackling the Covid-19 outbreak. \n DOMESTIC TRUST \n Leaders need stocks of legitimacy to be trusted in a crisis when so many unknowns abound, and they build these stocks outside of the crisis period. \n Approval of United States President Donald Trump’s handling of the crisis follows partisan political lines. \n According to aggregate surveys by statistical website fivethirtyeight.com, between 10 and 16 per cent of Democrats trusted his handling of the crisis while 75 to 87 per cent of Republicans approved of it. \n Because Mr Trump domestically has only played to his base, non-Republicans simply did not trust him and a litany of his missteps were carefully documented, which will make it harder for him to carry out interventions that are needed. \n A leader who senses he lacks trust may also be overly concerned with optics rather than overcoming the situation. \n Experts also need stocks of legitimacy in order to be heeded. Unfortunately, this is not as obvious as it should be. \n Britain’s Brexit process had poisoned the well (the British public infamously had had enough of experts, according to British cabinet minister Michael Gove) and far too much of the population were eager to dismiss expert advice, especially when that advice would be disruptive to everyday life while the virus still appeared distant.  \n Put together, there has been a trust deficit that has hampered the effective addressing of the crisis. \n The turmoil on global stock markets suggests most firms and investors have no trust in the management of the outbreak in major industrialised economies and are pricing in for a hard recession. \n INTERNATIONAL TRUST \n International cooperation also requires trust — between countries and with international organisations. When the crisis in Wuhan unfolded in January, the US offered to send expert assistance but was rebuffed. One wonders if the reverse will hold true should the crisis escalate in the US and China offers its help. \n Countries have always devised foreign policies that support their domestic interests and public opinion but doing so is a delicate matter when it comes to close neighbours whose reactions also have domestic impact. \n When one country trusts that the other is handling a problem effectively, things are fine. \n But when that trust does not hold because of insufficient information, it may be forced to take preventive measures, even at economic cost to itself, if only to assuage domestic pressure. \n In the early days of the outbreak in Wuhan, several countries risked Chinese ire as they announced travel bans from China. Yet today, it is China that is now following this logic to place travel restrictions on other countries. \n Attempts to cover up cases, the slow rollout of testing (and thus lack of information), or ineffectual responses make it difficult for neighbours to trust that others have a handle on the situation. Lower trust — and therefore raised defences — will be inevitable until they come to grips with the situation. \n MULTILATERAL TRUST \n Multilateral cooperation had been brought to its lowest ebb just prior to the outbreak of the crisis. \n International organisations such as the World Trade Organisation are teetering on the verge of collapse, with its dispute settlement mechanism broken. \n The US-China trade war, which had only just begun to show signs of abating, had led many countries to hedge against both superpowers. \n Britain chose to go with Huawei in its 5G infrastructure against the US’ wishes, while erstwhile Chinese partners were reviewing infrastructure projects on the backs of debt and sustainability fears. A lack of trust in the multilateral system preceded the Covid-19 outbreak. \n On Covid-19, the World Health Organization was initially criticised in Asia for not declaring an emergency earlier in January, sparking a petition with half a million signatures. It did eventually declare an emergency on Jan 31, followed by a pandemic on March 11. \n However, the emergency declaration on Jan 31 seemed to be ignored by those outside Asia, and many countries are now paying the price for this. Yet one must ask why the WHO’s warning went unheeded: Did it have enough legitimacy and trust to be taken seriously immediately? \n REBUILDING FRACTURED TRUST \n Whatever the case, the pandemic is now upon all of us. National interests around the globe have converged over Covid-19 and will require multilateral cooperation to effectively address it, so the G7’s coming together is welcome, though only a first step. \n Countries large and small, rich and poor, all have the same interest: To quash this disease as quickly as possible. It is also fundamentally a public health issue that can, like pandemics before, be defeated without politicisation. \n We are now seeing demonstrable success in Singapore, China, and South Korea that have effectively nullified the domestic threat of the virus — they now appear most impacted by importing it from countries where the virus is still uncontrolled. They have managed systems that are effective and trusted to contain their outbreaks. \n While many countries still need to put domestic control measures in place urgently, this is also a rare opportunity to strengthen a troubled multilateral system and should not be wasted. \n  ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Dr Joel Ng is a research fellow with the Centre for Multilateralism Studies, S.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "周一（3月16日），七国集团（G7）领导人宣布了一系列应对Covid-19大流行病的措施，七国集团特别强调协调与合作，措施包括信息共享、全球经济救济和公共卫生。\n在那些不信任全球治理架构的国家中，单边主义的分裂正在抬头，这可以被视为多边体系的一个提振，但七国集团行动的成功将取决于世界对其处理危机的能力的信任程度。\n事实上，如果有一个词概括了Covid-19在全球造成巨大破坏时所面临的治理挑战，那就是“信任”这个词。\nCovid-19已经扰乱了受影响国家生活的方方面面，引起了人们的担忧，并引发了不确定性。然而，人们的反应减少了一个关键因素：信任——或者缺乏——他们的邻居，他们的医疗或福利系统，以及他们的权威。\n当恐慌性购买或商店挤兑在世界各地爆发时，一种熟悉的模式反复上演：人们面对不确定性和恐惧，寻求安全的库存。\n研究银行挤兑的经济学家们对这种模式很熟悉：它说明了在不确定的情况下自我保护的基本逻辑——以及对银行体系缺乏信任的情况。\n然而，个人的理性行为可能导致系统性的非理性结果，或者通俗地说：恐慌。\n因此，确保一个系统能够在危机中满足人们的需求，然后说服他们这样做，必须是应对Covid-19疫情的主要方面之一。\n国内信托\n当如此多的未知因素充斥时，领导人需要在危机中信任合法性股票，他们在危机期之外建立这些股票。\n美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）对危机处理的批准遵循党派政治路线。\n根据统计网站Fivethirty8的综合调.com网站上，10%到16%的民主党人相信他对危机的处理方式，而75%到87%的共和党人则表示赞同。\n因为特朗普在国内只发挥了自己的基础，非共和党人根本不信任他，而且他一系列的失误都被仔细记录在案，这将使他更难进行必要的干预。\n一个感觉自己缺乏信任的领导者也可能过分关注光学，而不是克服这种情况。\n专家们也需要有合法性的股票才能被关注，不幸的是，这并不像应该的那么明显。\n英国的脱欧进程毒害了这口井（根据英国内阁大臣迈克尔戈夫（Michael Gove）的说法，臭名昭著的英国公众已经有足够的专家了），而且太多的民众急于拒绝专家的建议，特别是当这种建议会对日常生活造成破坏，而病毒似乎仍然遥不可及的时候\n总而言之，目前存在的信任赤字阻碍了危机的有效解决。\n全球股市的动荡表明，大多数公司和投资者对主要工业化经济体爆发疫情的管理缺乏信心，并正在为一场严重衰退做好准备。\n国际信托\n国际合作还需要国家之间和国际组织之间的信任。今年1月武汉危机爆发时，美国曾表示愿意派遣专家协助，但遭到拒绝。人们不禁要问，如果美国危机升级，而中国提供帮助，这种情况是否会逆转。\n各国总是制定支持本国利益和公众舆论的外交政策，但对于反应也有国内影响的近邻来说，这样做是一个微妙的问题。\n当一个国家相信另一个国家正在有效地处理一个问题时，情况就好.\n但当这种信任由于信息不足而无法维系时，它可能被迫采取预防措施，即使是以自身的经济成本为代价，如果只是为了缓解国内压力的话。\n在武汉疫情爆发的早期，一些国家在宣布禁止从中国旅行时冒着中国愤怒的风险。然而今天，正是中国遵循这一逻辑，对其他国家实施旅行限制。\n试图掩盖案件、测试的缓慢展开（因此缺乏信息）或无效的回应，使得邻居们很难相信其他人有能力处理这种情况。在他们处理好这种局面之前，信任度降低——因此防御能力提高——将是不可避免的。\n多边信托\n就在危机爆发之前，多边合作已陷入低谷。\n世界贸易组织（wto）等国际组织正摇摇欲坠，濒临崩溃，其争端解决机制已被打破。\n美中贸易战刚刚开始显现缓和迹象，导致许多国家对这两个超级大国采取对冲措施。\n英国违背美国的意愿，选择与华为合作开发5G基础设施，而过去的中国合作伙伴则在债务和可持续性担忧的支持下审查基础设施项目。在Covid-19爆发之前，人们对多边体系缺乏信任。\n在Covid-19上，世界卫生组织（who）一月份早些时候在亚洲因没有宣布紧急状态而受到批评，引发了50万人签名的请愿书。它最终在1月31日宣布进入紧急状态，随后在3月11日爆发了一场大流行病。\n然而，1月31日的紧急声明似乎被亚洲以外的国家忽视了，许多国家正在为此付出代. 然而，人们必须问，为什么世界卫生组织的警告没有得到重视：它是否具有足够的合法性和信任，可以立即受到重视？\n重建断开的信任\n不管是什么情况，现在我们大家都面临着流行病。全球各国的利益已经在Covid-19上趋同，需要多边合作才能有效解决这一问题，因此七国集团走到一起是值得欢迎的，尽管这只是第一步。\n大小国家，贫富国家，都有同样的利益：尽快消灭这种疾病。从根本上讲，这也是一个公共卫生问题，可以像以前的流行病一样，在没有政治化的情况下被击败。\n我们现在在新加坡、中国和韩国看到了明显的成功，这些国家已经有效地消除了国内的病毒威胁——它们现在似乎受到了从那些病毒仍然无法控制的国家进口病毒的最大影响。他们管理的系统是有效和可信的，可以控制疫情。\n虽然许多国家仍需紧急落实国内控制措施，但这也是加强陷入困境的多边体系的难得机会，不应浪费。\n关于作者：\n吴俊杰博士是南洋理工大学拉贾拉特南国际研究学院多边主义研究中心研究员。这首先出现在RSIS评论中",

Expeditions were suspended in 2015 after a major earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 that year, killing some 9,000 people.  \n Eighteen people were killed at the Everest base camp when an avalanche triggered by the quake roared down a slope.  \n \"This is disappointing news for both our expedition leaders and our clients who have trained for months for this year’s climb,\" Lukas Furtenbach, of the California-based guiding company Furtenbach Adventure, said.  \n Adrian Ballinger of the Alpenglow Expeditions company said he understood the decision.  \n “While cancelling a climb is never an outcome we want, this time, it’s the responsible thing to do,” Ballinger said in a statement.  \n “A COVID-19 outbreak at base camp would be dangerous and potentially devastating,” he said.  \n Nepal would also stop issuing visas on arrival until April 30, an official said.  \n (This story corrects term COVID in penultimate paragraph.)

In the beginning other countries feared us, now we fear them [for bringing in the virus].\" \n He elaborated further in a reply to the Post later on Sunday that in his view, the epidemic would not end until a cheap and effective antiviral or vaccine became available or the majority of the population had contracted the virus and got natural immunity. \n Since late February, Covid-19 infections have jumped in South Korea, Italy and Iran, which are now the three countries with the highest number of cases outside China. On Sunday, it was reported that Italy would quarantine the entire Lombardy region with a population of some 10 million, after recording its biggest surge in daily cases, at 1,247, since the outbreak in the country began on Feb 21. \n As of Sunday evening, Hong Kong had 114 confirmed cases and three related deaths. \n Mr Yuen also urged people to avoid travelling at least until the end of the year. He pointed to two infections in Hong Kong that were linked to a recent tour group to India. Another woman in her 80s from the same group was also diagnosed with Covid-19 after returning to Vancouver, Canada. \n \"When the epidemic is serious, avoid travelling to other places unless necessary,\" Mr Yuen said. \n He added that while the global spread of the virus had shifted the focus away from tightening border measures between Hong Kong and mainland China, it was too early to tell if the situation on the mainland would be \"under control by April\", as suggested by some experts there. \n Mr Yuen also said the virus, like most strains, had been mutating, but assured that for now there was no evidence to suggest it had become more deadly or easily transmitted. \n The key to fighting epidemics, Mr Yuen reiterated, started with personal hygiene. \n \"If everyone washes his or her hand, wears a mask all the time and maintains social distancing, the risk of infection will be lowered. It's a matter of compliance,\" Mr Yuen said. \n \"We cannot guard against the virus forever, but the longer we delay its spread, the higher the chances of getting a vaccine in time.\" \n In a separate interview also published on Sunday by mainland Chinese online media Caixin, Mr Yuen said his team and other scientists were developing a vaccine. He revealed that tests on mice showed no side effects, and successfully produced antibodies, but further procedures were required. \n \"I believe it will be one year or 11/2 years until clinical applications,\" he was quoted as saying.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — To ensure that Singapore residents continue to observe good public and personal hygiene even beyond the Covid-19 outbreak, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) on Friday (March 6) announced a new SG Clean Taskforce.  \n The taskforce will introduce mandatory cleaning standards from 2021, at places such as preschools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres. It will also encourage the public to adopt personal hygiene practices among other measures.  \n It will build on the work from the SG Clean campaign announced last month, which introduced a cleanliness indicator that has been rolled out at hawker centres and coffee shops nationwide. \n Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said at a press conference on Friday that raised hygiene standards will have to be our “new norms”, and that decontamination of the environment is “a common and shared responsibility”.  \n \"This is the best way forward because this is how we can carry on with our lives while making some adjustments... What we know now is that from our research… is that the environment contamination is an important factor in the transmission of the virus, but we also found that it is easily decontaminated,” he said.  \n The announcement of the new taskforce comes a day after Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that Singapore “must expect to see significantly higher numbers\" of new Covid-19 cases in time to come.  \n Speaking in Parliament during the Ministry of Health's (MOH) Committee of Supply debate, Mr Gan said that as the number of cases outside mainland China continues to grow at an “alarming rate”, that Singapore has to adopt a Whole-of-Government approach and mobilise the resources of all the relevant agencies to mount a swift and effective response. \n MANDATORY CLEANING STANDARDS \n Amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act will be made later this year to introduce mandatory cleaning standards. This will include, for example, details on the frequency at which high-contact areas such as public toilets are cleaned and disinfected.  \n In addition, greater accountability will be placed on-premise managers for the cleanliness of their premises. They will be required to submit and implement an environmental sanitation programme and ensure that cleanliness issues on their premises are resolved.  \n They will also need to appoint a trained “designated person” to assist them to develop and enforce the environmental sanitation programme.  \n The National Environment Agency will also work with sectoral leads to “progressively implement” the new requirements from 2021, starting with higher-risk premises such as preschools, schools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres.  \n “The Government will put standards in place and take enforcement action when it is not met,” Mr Zulkifli added.  \n ADJUSTING SOCIAL NORMS  The SG Clean Taskforce will also introduce measures to adjust social norms, by encouraging the use of serving spoons when sharing food and keeping tables clean, among other behaviours. \n It will also be encouraging the “7 habits of good public hygiene”, which includes washing hands and the daily taking of temperature to reduce the risks of spreading diseases.  \n Minister of National Development Lawrence Wong speaking at the press conference said that while improving public hygiene is the “easiest to tackle”, it is personal hygiene and social norms that are “a bit more difficult”.  \n “That is why we need everyone to step up… The good news is that we do see habits already changing.”  \n The SG Clean Taskforce, which was announced on Friday, builds on the SG Clean campaign launched on Feb 16.  \n One component of the campaign is a cleanliness indicator called the “SG Clean quality mark” which is awarded to premises such as hawker stalls and coffee shops that “commit to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists”.  \n To date, 1,907 hawker and market stalls, and 345 coffee shop stalls, as well as 13 hawker centres and 49 coffee shops have been awarded the SG Clean quality mark. \n Said Mr Wong: “Increasingly, social efforts become an important line of our defence, what we do within Singapore.” \n “That is why this SG Clean campaign is vital to Singapore… They seem simple but they really seem to have an effective way of slowing down the virus.”  \n In a Facebook post on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also wrote about the importance of hygiene and cleanliness. \n \"More and more people are getting infected all over the world. Singapore has restricted travellers from badly hit countries, but we can’t close our borders completely. So we must expect more cases and clusters to pop up in Singapore,\" he wrote.  \n He said while Singapore has been quite successful in identifying patients, tracing contacts and stamping out clusters, we also need to slow the spread of the virus and that means raising hygiene standards. \n \"Better hygiene must be our first line of defence,\" he wrote.  \n   \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON/TOKY0 - As the new coronavirus spreads in South Korea, Europe and the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move to try to prevent a global recession with the virus taking a heavy toll on air travel, tourism and other industries.  \n Despite the Fed's attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, U.S. stock indexes were down more than 3%, safe-haven gold rose 3% and analysts and investors are questioning if the rate cut will be enough in the long run if the virus continues to spread.  \n In Iran, doctors and nurses lack supplies and 77 people have died, the highest number outside China. The United Arab Emirates announced it was closing all schools for four weeks.  \n The death toll in Italy, Europe's worst-affected country, jumped to 79 on Tuesday and Italian officials are considering expanding the area under quarantine. France reported its fourth coronavirus death and Iceland, Indonesia, Ukraine and Argentina reported their first coronavirus cases, taking the global total to around 80 countries.  \n About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, but the novel coronavirus can be contained, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.  \n \"To summarise, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained,\" World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.  \n Health officials have said the death rate may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease.  \n The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.  \n There are almost 91,000 cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China.  \n China's death toll was 2,943, with more than 125 fatalities elsewhere.  \n In a unanimous decision, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. U.S. President Donald Trump said a half point cut was not enough.  \n Finance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth.  \n  \n AGGRESSIVE CONTAINMENT  \n China - where new coronavirus cases have been falling sharply and the 129 cases in the last 24 hours was the lowest number reported since Jan. 20 - is increasingly concerned about the virus being brought back into the country by citizens returning from new hotspots elsewhere.  \n Travellers entering Beijing from South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy would have to be quarantined for 14 days, a city official said. Shanghai has introduced a similar order.  \n The worst outbreak outside China is in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in declared war on the virus, ordering additional hospital beds and more masks as cases rose by 600 to nearly 5,000, with 34 deaths.  \n WHO officials also expressed concerns about the situation in Iran, saying doctors lacked respirators and ventilators needed for patients with severe case of the respiratory illness.  \n WHO emergency programme head Michael Ryan said the need in Iran was \"more acute\" than for other countries.  \n While the case numbers in Iran appear to be bad, he said, \"things tend to look worse before getting better.\"  \n The International Olympic Committee on Tuesday said the summer games in Tokyo set to begin on July 24 were still expected to happen despite Japan having nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths.  \n In the United States, there are now 108 people in 12 states with the coronavirus and six deaths in the Seattle area.  \n New York state reported its second case, a man in his 50s who works in Manhattan and has been hospitalized.  \n The public transportation agency in New York, the most densely populated major U.S. city of more than 8 million, said on Twitter it was deploying \"enhanced sanitising procedures\" for stations, train cars, buses and certain vehicles.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html) REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Having booked a 13-day road trip across South Korea for April at the start of December last year, Mr Ng Cher Pheng and his family were still raring to go up until recently, even though Covid-19 cases were on the rise in China. \n It was only when cases of the viral infection in South Korea began to spike dramatically that the 65-year-old retiree, along with his wife and daughter, decided to cancel their trip. \n The problem he now faces? Securing a refund for his Korean Air flight tickets, having paid S$2,200 for three return tickets to Seoul. He had called and emailed the airline last Wednesday (Feb 27) to inquire about the possibility of a refund, but has not yet received any replies. \n “The airlines should see the situation. We are flying to their country and it's not so safe,” Mr Ng told TODAY last Friday. “They should pay us back… even if it’s just 50 per cent… but if it’s been two weeks and they haven't got back to us, what can we do?” \n Korean Air’s website does not make it clear whether Mr Ng and his family would be entitled to a refund. \n In a reply to queries from TODAY, a spokesperson said the airline has taken note of Mr Ng's case. \n \"The average number of inquiries at our reservation call center have increased dramatically due to the Covid-19 issue,\" she said. \"Please be assured we are doing our best to reduce the waiting time for our customers, as well as handling inquiries in order of receipt. We are also updating the latest change/refund guidelines on our website as quickly as possible.\" \n The airline will continue to monitor the situation and adjust its policies accordingly to ensure the safety and health of passengers and to minimise customers' inconvenience, she added.  \n Reported cases of Covid-19 in South Korea have shot up from a mere 31 cases on Feb 18 to 4,212 as of March 2. \n Some airlines flying between Singapore and China or South Korea have offered their customers full refunds for cancelled flights, and for those customers from countries with travel restrictions whose plans have been affected. \n But many customers are still not able to get their hands on these refunds, given the high volume of calls the airlines have been getting in recent weeks amid the Covid-19 outbreak that has been spreading worldwide. \n PUT ON HOLD FOR THREE HOURS \n A customer of budget carrier Scoot, who wants to be known only as Benedict, said that his flight from Tianjin, China to Singapore at the start of February was cancelled abruptly, and he had to make hasty arrangements to return home, which involved booking several transfer flights that amounted to S$1,600. \n The 29-year-old who works in the finance industry said that he tried calling Scoot to ask for a refund on the S$400 return fare, but had to call about 10 times — being put on hold for as long as three hours on one attempt — from Feb 2 to Feb 26 before he finally got confirmation that the refund would be sent to his bank in five days. \n However, not all customers caught up in the outbreak have been able to secure refunds and they have had to settle for date changes instead. \n Mr Jack Wee, a student at a tertiary education institute, said that he had booked a flight with Scoot to Seoul on March 7 with his girlfriend and wanted to cancel the holiday due to the outbreak there, but managed to contact the customer service hotline only two weeks after he began calling on Feb 17. \n “I tried to call three times a day and waited up to 30 minutes per call,” the 23-year-old said. \n It was only last Friday morning that he managed to get through to Scoot, which told him that he could not cancel his booking, but could only reschedule it to a later date. Though the fee to make the change was waived, Mr Wee still had to pay the fare difference of more than S$400 for both tickets, on top of the S$600 he already paid for them. \n “It kind of made me feel trapped — either I spend another S$400 or I just go ahead (with the trip) and pray that I don’t catch the virus.” \n Replying to queries from TODAY, Scoot said that it “sincerely apologises for the inconvenience caused, and would like to assure passengers that all committed refunds will be processed within 30 business days”. \n It added that there has been a delay in the process of refunding due to the “high volume of bookings that need to be refunded, beyond the initial batch of mainland China flights that were cancelled”. \n Instead of calling its phone line, Scoot urged customers to reach out to the company via Facebook messenger or through its online feedback form. \n Its website stated that customers travelling from Feb 25 to April 30 on flights to or from South Korea — excluding those whose flights originate from Taiwan — can either re-route to another destination, rebook the flight, or refund the value of the flight via a Scoot travel voucher. \n Among other measures, Scoot has also been providing refunds for ticket holders to mainland China routes where operations have been suspended since Feb 8. \n OTHER AIRLINES AND THEIR POLICIES \n Scoot is not the only airline company with frustrated customers. \n The Facebook pages of other Singapore-based airlines such as Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Jetstar, as well as international airlines that fly into Singapore, have been inundated with comments from their customers, with many confused about refund policies or frustrated that the firms have been unresponsive. \n Like Mr Wee, some of these Facebook users claimed that they had spent days trying to contact the airlines to no avail. \n In response to queries from TODAY, SIA said that it is “closely monitoring the evolving situation”, and that customers should check its website for the latest waiver policy. \n As of Monday, SIA said on its website that for those travelling to South Korea, it would waive all change fees for customers with travel dates between Feb 25 and April 30, for tickets issued on or before Feb 25. For those with travel plans to mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, customers may have their cancellation and change fees waived for travel dates from Jan 24 to April 30, for tickets issued on or before Feb 8. \n At Jetstar, its website states that customers travelling to mainland China, as well as Hong Kong, may request a full refund or waiver of change fee should their flight have been cancelled or rescheduled. \n Both SIA and Jetstar acknowledged on their websites that their respective customer service hotlines were facing a high volume of calls and sought the understanding of their customers for the delays. \n Chinese airline companies China Eastern Airlines and Air China have also announced on their Facebook pages that within certain departure dates, they would be refunding customers who face travel restrictions into China. \n MANY MARKETS AFFECTED \n Analysts interviewed by TODAY said that the airline industry is struggling to cope with the sudden flood of cancellations because this is a “once in many years situation”. \n Aviation analyst Brendan Sobie of Sobie Aviation said that airline companies will find it “hard to plan for this kind of scenario, because they are trying to cut costs and capacity, but at the same time they don’t know how long (the outbreak) would last”. \n While there are incidents such as volcano eruptions that affect individual markets, the worldwide effect of the outbreak makes this situation especially difficult for airline companies due to the many markets involved, he added. \n “Customers want a faster response, but companies cannot (hire) staff (to handle customer service) just for this once-in-many-years situation.”  \n CORRECTION: In an earlier version of this report, we got aviation analyst Brendan Sobie's designation wrong.

Thirty-one people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals. \n The bulk of the confirmed cases were Chinese visitors or Thais who worked in the tourism sector. \n The 35-year-old man who died was a consultant for a duty-free store frequented by tourists, near Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport. \n Retail giant King Power, which sub-contracts the company that owned the store, said in a statement Sunday the branch where the man worked has been temporarily closed since Feb 6. \n Thailand's tourism sector — heavily reliant on Chinese tourists — has been hit hard by the virus, which originated from a city in central China.

Customers understand brands, many of them multinationals, that need products to put them on the market. And the cause of this panic is the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has paralyzed much of China and is now hitting northern Italy hard.\nCesar Araujo is also chairman of the board of directors at Calvelex, a company in the sector that has a large part of its production dedicated to brands directed to the luxury market. Calvelex suspended part of the production last week, as usual at the time, underlines the administrator, but seeking to catch breath and save raw materials- some were already short- for a period of more orders.\n\"For example, silk comes from Asia and China. As much as I want to, I will not find a supplier who can supply it,\"he says. And the decrease in orders is also a problem: \"In this sector, for some customers the Chinese market is the first and for others it is the second. With these curfew measures, people do not consume either. It is possible that production may have to be stopped because some factories depend on these supplies.\"\nThe President of ANIVEC advances to the Express that there are talks with the Ministries of Labour and Economics, as well as with the State Secretariat of Internationalisation (which depends on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to find ways to find solutions and \"anticipate problems in the supply chain\".\nCaesar Araujo points to the fact that several airlines have ceased to fly to China and that port inspections are lengthy as two more factors of difficulty in regularizing the situatioYeah. And be warned: the stocks of raw materials of the companies in the sector at best last six weeks, so production is already at stake for the coming weeks.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak hit two nerve regions not only for this sector, but also for clothing and footwear. \"China produces more than 20% of the tradable goods in the world, something like this has a global impact. Italy is also a major producer of raw materials and brands\", underlined\nMicam, Mipele and Lineapelle: The three shoe fairs that took place last week in Milan, Italy are called, and where there were around 400 Portuguese, representing more than 100 companies in the sector, confirmed to the Expresso Paulo Goncalves, communications director of APICCAPS, the Portuguese Association of Industrial Footwear, Components, Skin Articles and their Sucleons.\nIn luggage, the association has given instructions to its associates on the coronavirus, according to what the World Health Organisation and the Directorate-General for Health recommend to travellers these days, and none of them have given up on participation, notes the person responsible. Almost everyone will have returned to Portugal by Friday, before the escalation in Italy, where there have already been seven deaths. At Malpensa Airport, there was a temperature check on who arrived and further instructions were given, but there was still no widespread concern on Monday.\nThese are not common measures, but they have not caused much disturbance to visitors of the events. The difference was within the fairs, where there was less \"20% of travellers\" and much less Asians. \"I would venture to say that there was none there,\" says Paul Goncalves. Therefore, despite everything taking place in a \"normal\" climate, there is some apprehension in the Portuguese footwear industry: \"For a sector that exports 98% of production to virtually everyone, this is always a sign of some concerYeah. We anticipate results that cannot be good\".\n\"At the moment we have no dramatic situation. Of course we are apprehensive when things do not go the way we want and there are possible breakdowns, we are not unconscious and the textile needs several components to continue working. There are signs coming from China that things will be resolved, we hope so\", declares to Mario Jorge Machado, the President of Portugal's Textile and Clothing Association (ATP).\nThe leader of ATP first stresses that the situation in Italy is \"very recent\" and that it arises in the context of Carnival holidays, where much of the textile factories in Portugal are at a standstill. \"We must now wait a little longer and se e if there is a need for some sort of measure to prevent some kind of problem with northern Italy, which, from the point of view of the whole of Europe, is a very important point of trade,\" he said.\nMario Jorge Machado is already able to be more specific about possible problems due to the situation in China, where the new coronavirus was initially detected. In this case, the fear is that there is a shortage of raw materials and components, namely synthetic yarn, some labels, plastic accessories, zippers, a situation that has not yet occurred among ATP members.\n\"The information we have is that production in China is being resumed only with local staff, some of them are about thirty percent from their capacity. Let's hope he's normalizing,\"he adds.\nIf Portuguese textiles manage to keep their normal operation, Mario Jorge Machado even anticipates that some orders for units in China can be made in Portugal\n\"I have felt in recent days, particularly in MODtissimo [the textile salon held this Wednesday and Thursday at Port Airport], that buyers of several Portuguese brands have made more orders to avoid being exposed to more geo-health and geopolitical issueYeah. As the popular saying goes, they don't want to put all their eggs in the same basket,\"he says.\nAs regards footwear, the problems with raw materials do not torment industrialists so much. China is not a \"first-line supplier\" of the industry, except \"some accessories and buckles\", explains Paul Goncalvlves of APICCAPS. On the other hand, footwear works in Portugal as a'cluster'in which there are several companies for various types of components, ensuring continuity of production.\nAs for the markets concerned, they are also not of the first order: the footwear industry exports around 40 million euros to Italy and a little less to China and Hong Kong (30 million). To understand the proportion, exports to France reach the 400 million euros and to the US at the 100 million euro.\nIn terms of international fairs, the Asian market is usually dealt with only by APICCAPS from April onwards. \"We have some actions in Tokyo planned, we will have to see how the next few weeks go. For now everything is more or less in accordance with normality, but objectively no one can make predictions.",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Last Wednesday (Feb 19), Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat told Bloomberg TV in an interview that the Government has no plans to ease property cooling measures. \n “It is not on our radar at this point because we need to make sure that we stabilise the economy and we address long term structural issues,” he said.   \n This is understandable given that the Covid-19 outbreak has led to a percentage point downgrade in the official forecast of Singapore’s economic growth this year. \n At the same time, the outbreak will also have an adverse impact on the private residential market, with spillover effects on the entire real estate value chain and the longer-term stability of the property market.  \n Why is this so? \n Let’s take a look at where the market stands today as well as cooling measures such as the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD). \n Currently, developers now must build and sell all their units in a project within five years to get a remission of the ABSD on the land purchase price. \n Otherwise they will have to pay the 25 per cent ABSD, with interest. \n ABSD was 10 per cent when it was introduced in Dec 2011, before it was raised to 15 per cent in July 2013 and the current 25 per cent in July 2018. \n In 2020, developers are going to launch some 10,402 units from 48 projects, based on Cushman & Wakefield Research’s estimate. Of these, 4,765 units or 46 per cent will come from the luxury segment or the Core Central Region (CCR) segment. \n Traditionally, about 28 per cent of the buyers of CCR homes are permanent residents and foreigners from China, which has been hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Singapore has since banned travellers who have visited mainland China recently, and the majority of that includes Chinese passport holders who could be the potential buyers of these luxury units. In 2019, non-PR China buyers bought a total of 359 units, of which 141 units were in the CCR. \n At a broader level, demand for private residential units might slow to a trickle soon, judging from the market reactions in our neighbouring countries affected by Covid-19. \n As an indication of how far sales could fall, China home sales plunged by 90 per cent in the first week of February compared to the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data on 36 cities compiled by China Merchants Securities Co.  \n Before the virus outbreak, the Singapore market was already expecting a more challenging sales environment in the coming months due to resistance to high prices and launch fatigue especially for smaller developments. The mood is now more bearish due to the virus outbreak. \n The temporary shortage of labour will also have an impact on the property market. \n Construction companies have expressed concerns about failing to meet deadlines due to workers from China not being able to return to Singapore and quarantine orders placed on affected workers in the industry. \n The authorities have urged developers not to penalise contractors and subcontractors for the unexpected delays. \n Beyond a temporary labour shortage, construction companies face a bigger and complex challenge arising from the global supply chain disruption caused by the lock-down in many China cities, with factories remaining shut or operating with reduced capacity. \n In Singapore, construction material and finished products are not expected to arrive in time for assembly or use. As manufacturers in China and the entire world are so interdependent, it is hard to predict how soon manufacturing would resume and at what capacity. \n What has made the situation more dire for Singapore construction firms is the mandatory adoption of the pre-fabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (PPVC) method at many Government Land Sales sites. \n Modern construction technology such as PPVC requires all components to be assembled off-site before they are delivered to the project site under construction. These include door, glass panels, tiles, sanitary ware etc. It does not allow construction to proceed if there is just one missing item. \n Although the current supply chain disruption would likely impact all stages of construction, the impact on PPVC construction would be more pronounced. \n The construction delay and the ripple effect beyond the short to medium term could have serious repercussions on the already fragile residential market. \n In about two to three years’ time, the Singapore residential market could deal with a supply overhang arising from the enbloc boom between 2017 and 2018. \n At the same time, all developers are bound by a five-year ABSD remission deadline that is fast approaching amid slower sales. \n On the supply front, there are 49,173 uncompleted private residential units (excluding executive condominiums) with planning approval. \n Of this, 30,162 remain unsold. There are also an additional 4,575 private residential units that do not have planning approval yet. \n Based on the 9,912 units sold in 2019, it should take developers roughly about five years to clear the existing stock and narrowly escape the ABSD penalty, assuming sales momentum in 2019 can be maintained this year. \n Looking at how things are now, it is unlikely that developers will be able to sell their projects at the same pace as previously anticipated.  \n In short, they could be hit with a double whammy – construction delays and potentially missing the ABSD deadline due to unforeseen circumstances which are no fault of theirs. \n Developers could slash prices drastically to try to move units but this could have a destabilising effect on the market as a whole. \n It is still fairly early days and how long the outbreak will last and how exactly it will affect the broader economy and the property market is still unclear.  \n But if the outbreak worsens, there is a case to be made for the authorities to extend the current ABSD deadline. \n The point is not only to provide much needed relief for developers, but to cushion the impact on the property sector. \n As it is, the current ABSD rule is too blunt a tool, as it does not differentiate the larger projects of hundreds or even thousands of units, from the smaller ones. \n As the economy is expected to head south, the larger projects have a much higher chance of missing the deadline, as they typically require a much longer time to sell out all the units especially during challenging times like now. \n An extension of the ABSD deadline would help developers to stagger new home sales and manage risks better arising from supply overhang. \n It would go a long way to help the market, long after the virus blows over, to avert a worst-case scenario that housing units are dumped in the open market in a disorderly manner, hurting both consumers and the economy. \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHOR: \n Christine Li is head of research for Singapore and Southeast Asia at global property consultancy Cushman & Wakefield. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Although it is still far too early to say the worst is over, the Covid-19 outbreak appears to have tapered off in Singapore in the past week, several experts said on Friday (Feb 21), four weeks after the coronavirus was first confirmed here. \n However, there is a growing concern that further cases of the infection could arrive from countries outside China and disrupt this recent positive streak, four infectious health diseases experts said in giving their take on the broad Covid-19 picture to date. \n Since the peak of confirmed cases a week ago, when nine cases were confirmed here in one day, Feb 14, experts noted that the number of new cases detected has fallen steadily, although there is no way to be certain that another surge will not happen. \n On both Thursday and Friday only one new confirmed case of Covid-19 in Singapore was reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH). \n On Wednesday, three cases were reported, including a 57-year-old woman who had initially been admitted to hospital for dengue fever. It was later confirmed she had both Covid-19 and dengue. \n No new clusters of local transmission have been detected for several days and most of the latest cases can all be traced back to earlier ones. A large number of patients confirmed with the disease have been discharged from the hospitals where they had been isolated. \n “The hysteria will quieten down in the next month unless something unexpected happens,\" Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) research policy and co-operation department in Geneva told TODAY. \n \"But, as I have said, the virus will most likely remain in the population. In my view? Normalise everything and learn to live with the virus,” he added. \n Recent reports from China, where the disease Covid-19 originated, have suggested that new transmission of the virus that causes it, Sars-CoV-2, has also fallen dramatically over the last few days. \n Referring to this trend, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said that Chinese data “appears to show a decline in new cases’’ but noted that any apparent trend “must be interpreted very cautiously”. \n Using data made available by the Singapore MOH, TODAY looked at how the pace of the Covid-19 outbreak has changed over the past four weeks since Case 1, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore on Jan 20 and was confirmed with the disease on Jan 23. \n DOWNWARD TREND IN THE NUMBER OF CASES IN PAST WEEK \n  \n Looking at the daily number of confirmed cases, the Covid-19 situation appears to have slowed in the past week, with a sharp drop in the number of cases from the record of nine on Feb 14 to one confirmed case on Friday. \n Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said it looks like the number of cases found on Feb 13 and 14, mostly arising from the Grace Assembly of God cluster, appears to be the peak of the outbreak in Singapore. \n \"The number of cases is coming down,” said Dr Leong. \n He noted that Singapore has been doing hundreds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per day — the test used to detect Covid-19 — and these cases must be seen in that context. \n “This means that we are truly looking for a needle in the haystack, which means the number of cases is truly low. There are very few, if not no cases of active transmission in Singapore,” he said. \n Agreeing with Dr Leong, Dr Pangestu said that the supposed peak outbreak here on Feb 14 is consistent with earlier scientific models that predicted that the number of new infections of the Covid-19 virus would peak in mid to late February. Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan, the eminent 83-year-old epidemiologist who had discovered the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, had given the same prediction as well. \n One study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted a February peak based on the basic reproductive number of Covid-19, which is the expected number of cases directly generated by one patient. For Covid-19, this number averages between 1.5 and 4.5. \n Biostatistician Alex Cook, who is the vice dean of research at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it is “certainly a good thing that the number of cases has been going down”. \n “(This falling trend) reflects the cases to identify and be isolated, and the efforts of MOH to conduct contact tracing, and healthcare workers to minimise infection in hospitals,” said Associate Professor Cook, who is the domain leader for biostatistics and modelling at the school. \n His colleague, Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, the school’s programme leader of infectious diseases and the co-director of global health, added that the fall in the number of confirmed cases in the past week indicates that Singapore’s efforts have been successful in limiting the spread of Covid-19. \n “It is likely that current massive contact tracing — initiated right at the start of the outbreak in Singapore — has led to the majority of cases being uncovered. Current quarantine and social distancing measures have also worked to reduce transmission in Singapore,” said Assoc Prof Hsu. \n FEWER NEW PRIMARY CASES DETECTED IN RECENT WEEKS \n  \n A key indicator is the number of primary cases found on a given day — patients who have had no known link to previous cases and could have contracted the virus through local transmission. \n Singapore upgraded its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level to Orange on Feb 7 when it discovered another three such primary cases, including Case 32, a Victoria Junior College teacher who had no recent travel history to China and no known link to the earlier cases. \n While finding these primary cases helps the authorities discover new ones through contact-tracing, they also highlight that there are more unknowns about how the Covid-19 situation is spreading in the community, said experts. \n But in the past week, no new cluster and fewer primary cases have appeared. The exceptions are the recently discovered Case 82, a 57-year-old Singaporean who had contracted both dengue and Covid-19, and Case 85, a 35-year-old Chinese national who did not travel to China recently. \n As these cases were confirmed only recently, a link could be established later when more detailed contact tracing has taken place. \n Commenting on this trend of fewer primary cases in the past week, Prof Pangestu said he hoped this would help to calm the public. \n While it could also mean that potential primary cases are still hidden from view, it is unlikely as the Singapore Government has been “very vigilant” in contact tracing. The trend shows that infected people have been effectively detected, isolated and treated. \n “It’s the nature of these epidemics — they start explosively and then run out of steam as public health measures kick in and the virus runs out of susceptible hosts.” \n Dr Leong noted that with Singapore expanding its case definitions to screen all patients with pneumonia for Covid-19, it is unlikely that cases would fall under the radar. \n But Singapore’s strengths in contact tracing will still be limited by the ability for patients to recall where they have been and with whom they have interacted, which could account for those cases with no known links, he said. \n “Lousy recollection means lousy contact tracing, which leads to lousy curtailment. We need to think out of the box,” said Dr Leong, suggesting that there should be a mobile phone application that is able to help build Singapore’s capability in contact tracing in future. \n LARGE PORTION OF EARLIER CASES DISCHARGED \n  \n Experts also noted that a majority of the cases detected in the first two weeks of the outbreak have been discharged, a trend that is similar to the experience in other countries. This high rate of discharges is also a sign that the Covid-19 situation is improving in Singapore. \n As of Friday, 47 out of the 86 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospital. The number of cases in critical condition — five currently — has also come down. \n The number of discharged cases does not include Covid-19 patients who do not suffer from any symptoms throughout their infection but are still hospitalised. \n Assoc Prof Hsu noted that in this regard, data published out of China and other countries has been similar. \n “Covid-19 infections are mild for more than 80 per cent of patients, which means these patients would not have needed hospitalisation based on medical needs alone. The patients were kept isolated in hospital to minimise the risk that they would spread the virus to others in the community,” he said. \n While there is no known vaccine for the disease yet, in Singapore and elsewhere, Covid-19 patients are treated with a mix of antiviral drugs normally used for HIV cases, such as ritonavir and lopinavir. These have been promising, Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, MOH’s chief health scientist said previously. \n Besides Singapore becoming more adept at treating Covid-19, there is also the chance that the virus could be turning milder which would explain why the newer cases are not so severe, said Dr Leong. \n Of the cases in China, Covid-19 has a mortality rate of around 2.3 per cent. By comparison, Sars had a mortality rate of 9.6 per cent during the 2003 outbreak, while Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) has a fatality rate of 35 per cent. \n The mortality rate of Covid-19 outside China — based on a small number of deaths — is lower still, at around 0.2 per cent, which is similar to swine flu and slightly above the seasonal flu. \n Prof Pangestu added: “The implication of this? It simply proves that most cases of Covid-19 are not severe and people should not be unduly concerned. It’s just like the flu and Zika.” \n MAJORITY OF CASES WITH NO LINK TO CHINA \n  \n However, a concerning statistic has emerged in recent weeks: Cases that cannot be traced back to mainland China have now exceeded those with a known link to China, said experts. \n Dr Leong said while it is no cause for alarm, the fact that a majority of cases have no link to China shows how close Singapore came to losing the ability to contain the viral spread from China. \n He said strong contact tracing helped to rein in the numbers, otherwise the unknown cases would continue to mount. \n “The first round of infection comes from China. The second round comes from locals who were infected with contact with the Chinese. That is expected in any ongoing epidemic. It is crucial to keep the lid on the second group and we seem to have done it,” said Dr Leong. \n But the experts suggested that something more surreptitious could be at play given the mounting travel restrictions against China. There is a growing concern that undetected cases of Covid-19 may be entering Singapore from other countries. \n Said Dr Leong: “Within China, the numbers are coming down and it is good that viral spread in the source (country) is being controlled. But the more important question is those who have left China and seeded to countries with less resources — can they take the heat?” \n Covid-19 cases outside China are growing at an accelerating rate. The number of new cases detected outside China climbed at a steady rate since Feb 7, and crossed the threshold of 100 new daily cases for the first time on Feb 17 and has remained high ever since. \n While the number of imported cases of Covid-19 in Singapore has been negligible after Singapore put in place border control measures, Assoc Prof Cook predicts that this could climb again, with increasing numbers of imports from other countries seeding more clusters in Singapore. \n “In normal times there is a lot of travel to and from Singapore and places like Japan and Thailand, both of which have quite large numbers of confirmed cases,” he said. \n Given Singapore’s close proximity and connections to Malaysia and Indonesia, Assoc Prof Cook said he is also concerned about the risk of future importation from these two nations. Indonesia has zero detected cases of Covid-19, though a Harvard study had questioned whether this was due to its lack of detection rather than the incidence of the virus. \n “With more cases being observed beyond China it looks far too early to celebrate,” said Assoc Prof Cook. \n   \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "新加坡——尽管说最坏的情况已经过去还为时过早，但几位专家周五（2月21日）表示，在冠状病毒首次在新加坡被证实4周后，Covid-19在新加坡的爆发似乎在过去一周逐渐减弱。\n然而，四位传染病专家在介绍迄今为止广泛的Covid-19照片时说，人们越来越担心，更多的感染病例可能来自中国以外的国家，并破坏最近的这种积极势头。\n自一周前确诊病例高峰出现以来，2月14日一天内这里确诊9例，专家指出，新发现病例数量稳步下降，但无法确定不会再次出现激增。\n周四和周五，新加坡卫生部（MOH）仅报告了一例Covid-19新确诊病例。\n星期三，报告了三个病例，其中包括一名57岁的妇女，她最初因登革热入院。后来证实她同时患有Covid-19和登革热。\n几天来没有发现新的本地传输集群，最新的大多数病例都可以追溯到早期病例。大量确诊患有此病的病人已从隔离的医院出院。\n李光耀公共政策学院（Lee Kuan-Yew School of Public Policy）访问学者、世界卫生组织（世卫组织）日内瓦研究政策与合作部前主任蒂基·艾尔卡·潘盖斯托教授今天表示：“除非发生意外，否则歇斯底里症将在下个月平息下来。”。\n“但是，正如我所说，这种病毒很可能仍然存在于人群中。在我看来？使一切正常化，学会与病毒共存，”他补充说.\nCovid-19病毒的发源地中国最近的报告显示，导致它的新病毒Sars-CoV-2在过去几天也急剧下降。\n在谈到这一趋势时，世卫组织总干事特德罗·阿德南姆·盖布雷耶苏曾表示，中国的数据“似乎显示新病例有所下降”，但他指出，任何明显的趋势“都必须非常谨慎地加以解释”。\n利用新加坡卫生部提供的数据，今天研究了自1号病例（66岁武汉居民，于1月20日抵达新加坡，并于1月23日确诊患有该病）以来，Covid-19疫情爆发的速度在过去四周内发生了怎样的变化。\n上周病例数下降趋势\n从每日确诊病例数来看，Covid-19的情况在过去一周似乎有所放缓，病例数从2月14日的9例锐减至周五的1例确诊病例。\n伊丽莎白山医院传染病专家梁浩南博士说，2月13日和14日发现的病例数量，似乎是新加坡爆发疫情的高峰期，这些病例大多来自上帝集团的恩典大会。\n“病例数量正在下降，”梁医生说。\n他指出，新加坡每天都要进行数百次聚合酶链反应（PCR）检测，这种检测方法用于检测Covid-19，这些病例必须在这种情况下才能看到。\n“这意味着我们正在大海捞针，这意味着案件数量确实很低。在新加坡，即使没有主动传播的病例，也很少。”。\n潘杰图博士同意梁振英博士的观点，他说，2月14日在这里出现的爆发高峰与先前的科学模型相一致，后者预测Covid-19病毒的新感染人数将在2月中下旬达到高峰. 83岁的著名流行病学家、发现Sars病毒的中国科学家钟南山也给出了同样的预测。\n伦敦卫生和热带医学院的一项研究根据Covid-19的基本生殖数量预测了2月份的高峰，这是一名患者直接产生的预期病例数。对于Covid-19，这个数字平均在1.5到4.5之间。\n生物统计学家亚历克斯·库克（Alex Cook）是Saw-Swee-Hock公共卫生学院的副院长，他说“病例数量下降无疑是件好事”。\n“这一下降趋势反映了需要识别和隔离的病例，以及卫生部进行接触追踪的努力，以及医护人员减少医院感染的努力，”库克副教授说，他是该校生物统计学和建模领域的负责人。\n他的同事、该校传染病项目负责人、全球卫生联合主任徐立扬副教授补充说，过去一周确诊病例数量的下降表明，新加坡在限制Covid-19的传播方面取得了成功。\n“目前的大规模接触追踪很可能是在新加坡疫情爆发之初就开始的，导致大多数病例被发现。目前的隔离和社会隔离措施也有助于减少在新加坡的传播。\n近几周新发现的原发病例较少\n一个关键的指标是在一天内发现的原发性病例的数量，这些病例与以前的病例没有已知的联系，并且可能通过本地传播感染了病毒.\n新加坡在2月7日将疾病爆发反应系统状态（Dorscon）警报级别提升至橙色，发现了另外三个这样的主要病例，其中包括病例32，一名维多利亚初级学院教师，他最近没有到中国旅行的历史，也与之前的病例没有已知联系。\n专家说，虽然发现这些主要病例有助于当局通过接触者追踪发现新病例，但他们也强调，关于Covid-19的情况如何在社区蔓延，还有更多的未知因素。\n但在过去的一周里，没有新的病例群出现，原发病例减少。例外情况是最近发现的病例82，一名57岁的新加坡人感染了登革热和Covid-19，病例85，一名35岁的中国公民，最近没有到中国旅行。\n由于这些病例只是最近才得到确认，因此在以后进行更详细的接触追踪时可以建立联系。\n在评论过去一周初审案件减少的趋势时，潘基斯托教授说，他希望这将有助于平息公众情绪。\n虽然这也可能意味着潜在的原发病例仍被隐藏在视线之外，但由于新加坡政府在接触追踪方面一直“非常警惕”，因此可能性不大。这一趋势表明，已对感染者进行了有效的检测、隔离和治疗。\n“这是这些流行病的本质——随着公共卫生措施的启动，病毒从易感宿主身上消失，它们开始爆炸，然后失去动力。”\n梁振英博士指出，随着新加坡扩大病例定义，对所有肺炎患者进行Covid-19筛查，病例不太可能落入关注范围。\n但他说，新加坡在接触追踪方面的优势仍将受到患者回忆曾经去过的地方和与谁互动的能力的限制，这可能会解释那些没有已知联系的病例。\n“糟糕的回忆意味着糟糕的接触追踪，导致糟糕的缩减. 我们需要跳出框框思考，”梁振英博士说，他建议未来应该有一个手机应用程序，能够帮助新加坡建立联系追踪的能力。\n大部分早期病例已出院\n专家们还指出，在疫情爆发前两周发现的病例中，大多数已经出院，这一趋势与其他国家的经验类似。这种高放电率也是新加坡Covid-19状况正在改善的一个迹象。\n截至上周五，86例患者中有47例已完全痊愈出院。目前情况危急的病例有5例也有所下降。\n出院病例数不包括Covid-19名患者，他们在感染过程中没有任何症状，但仍在住院治疗。\n许教授指出，在这方面，中国和其他国家公布的数据是相似的。\n“对80%以上的患者来说，Covid-19感染是轻微的，这意味着这些患者不需要仅仅根据医疗需要住院治疗。这些病人在医院被隔离，以尽量减少他们将病毒传播给社区其他人的风险。”。\n虽然在新加坡和其他地方还没有这种疾病的已知疫苗，但Covid-19患者接受的是通常用于艾滋病毒病例的抗病毒药物的混合治疗，如利托那韦和洛匹那韦。卫生部首席卫生科学家谭卓川教授此前表示，这些都是有希望的。\n除了新加坡越来越擅长治疗Covid-19外，该病毒也有可能变得更温和，这可以解释为什么新的病例没有那么严重，Leong博士说。\n在中国的病例中，Covid-19的死亡率约为2.3%。相比之下，Sars的死亡率为92003年爆发期间为0.6%，而中东呼吸综合征（Mers）的死亡率为35%。\n中国境外的Covid-19的死亡率——基于少量死亡人数——仍然较低，约为0.2%，与猪流感相似，略高于季节性流感。\n潘杰斯托教授补充道：“这意味着什么？它仅仅证明了Covid-19的大多数病例并不严重，人们不应该过分担心。就像流感和兹卡一样。”\n大多数与中国无关的案件\n不过，专家们表示，最近几周出现了一个令人担忧的统计数字：无法追溯到中国大陆的病例已经超过了与中国有已知联系的病例。\n梁振英博士说，虽然这不值得惊慌，但事实上，大多数病例与中国没有任何联系，这表明新加坡已经非常接近失去控制从中国传播的病毒的能力。\n他说，强烈的接触追踪有助于控制这些数字，否则未知案件将继续增加。\n“第一轮感染来自中国。第二轮来自与中国人接触的当地人。这在任何正在流行的疾病中都是意料之中的。对第二组保持警惕是至关重要的，我们似乎已经做到了。\n但专家们认为，考虑到针对中国的旅游限制越来越多，可能会有更为隐蔽的事情发生。越来越多的人担心未被发现的Covid-19病例可能从其他国家进入新加坡。\n梁振英博士说：“在中国，这一数字正在下降，很好，病毒在源头（国家）的传播得到控制。但更重要的问题是，那些离开中国，播种到资源较少的国家的人，他们能承受住压力吗？”\nCovid-19例境外病例呈加速增长趋势. 自2月7日以来，中国境外发现的新病例数量稳步攀升，并于2月17日首次突破每日新增100例的门槛，此后一直居高不下。\n虽然在新加坡实施边境管制措施后，Covid-19在新加坡的进口病例数量微不足道，但库克教授预测，随着越来越多的从其他国家进口的病例在新加坡催生更多的集群，这一数字可能会再次攀升。\n他说：“正常情况下，来往新加坡和日本、泰国等地的旅行很多，这两个地方都有相当多的确诊病例。”。\n考虑到新加坡与马来西亚和印度尼西亚的距离和联系，库克副教授表示，他也担心未来从这两个国家进口的风险。印度尼西亚未发现任何Covid-19病例，不过哈佛大学的一项研究质疑这是否是由于其缺乏检测，而不是病毒的发病率。\n库克副教授说：“随着越来越多的病例在中国以外被观察到，现在庆祝还为时过早。”。\n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "HUBEI — These days, Ms Chloe Chang, a Taiwanese woman stranded at the centre of China’s coronavirus outbreak, says she wakes up every half-hour during the night. Sometimes she breaks down in tears. \n She and her family are effectively trapped in her grandmother’s apartment building, where a man recently died from the virus. Workers in hazmat suits haunt the surrounding streets, and the neighbourhood has a strong police presence. \n There are shortages of food and other essentials throughout Yichang, the Hubei province city of more than 4 million where they have been in limbo for weeks. \n “No household can go out at this time,” said Ms Chang, a 26-year-old industrial artist. She said she feared that even a trip for groceries would increase her chances of contracting the virus. \n “My child has eaten nine meals of plain noodles in the past three days,” she said of her 2-year-old son. \n Ms Chang and her family thought they were on the verge of escaping Yichang earlier this month, but the bus taking them to the airport was abruptly turned around. \n All she can do now is wait — and hope. \n “The government of Taiwan surely will come to our rescue,” her husband, Mr Calvin Fan, who is from Beijing, has reassured her. But the chartered flight they have eagerly awaited to evacuate them has yet to materialise. \n “Neither side wants us,” Chang said. “We’ve given up. Now we are refugees.” \n Taiwan and China each say the other is the reason that she and other Taiwan citizens are unable to leave Hubei, a province under lockdown, where hundreds have died from the coronavirus and tens of thousands have been infected. \n Ms Chang and hundreds of other Taiwanese people in Hubei had hoped to go home via chartered jet. But last month, after the first plane carrying evacuees landed in Taiwan with an infected passenger onboard, a backlash ensued on the self-governing island, which China claims as part of its territory. \n Some said Taiwan would not be able to handle an outbreak if more infected people arrived. Others said Taiwan should not help to evacuate mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan residents. \n Decades of tensions between the two governments have come to a head over the outbreak, and people like Ms Chang and her husband — both of who arrived in China last month to celebrate the Chinese New Year holiday with family — have become pawns in a complicated and dangerous game of political chess. \n Ms Chang said she was told by Chinese officials that she could return to Taiwan on a second chartered flight, scheduled for Feb 5. That day, her family boarded a bus bound for the airport in Wuhan, the provincial capital, where the coronavirus first emerged. \n But just as the bus was about to leave, she said, a Chinese official hopped on and announced that the flight would not take off, saying: “Taiwan won’t let you go back.” \n “I was really devastated,” Ms Chang said. \n Taiwan had a different explanation. According to officials there, reports in Chinese state media that said a flight was scheduled to leave were untrue — the two sides had never discussed it. \n Both governments, and their proxies, have continued to point fingers while Ms Chang and her compatriots languish in Hubei. \n “Taiwan authorities have repeatedly delayed the schedule,” Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, said last week. “Let the Taiwan compatriots return home as soon as possible, and stop making up all manner of excuses and rationale to block them from returning.” \n Mr Chen Shih-Chung, Taiwan’s minister of health and welfare, said Friday that “China still uses all excuses to delay the evacuation, and refuses our plans and suggestions.” \n Fears of the virus — and, perhaps, anti-China sentiment — have led Taiwan to escalate preventive measures in recent days. \n On Wednesday, Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre announced that children who have mainland citizenship but a Taiwanese parent would not be allowed to enter Taiwan for the time being if they were arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. \n Confined to her grandmother’s home for so long, Ms Chang has turned to her art as an outlet for the helplessness and resentment she feels. \n In a satirical cartoon she recently sketched, she portrayed the administration of Ms Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s president, as deliberately delaying the evacuation. \n She depicted the Taiwanese in Hubei as pawns.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Almost three times more cases of the Covid-19 virus could have been found globally if the rest of the world possessed the same “gold standard” detection capability as Singapore, a study by Harvard University researchers has found. \n “We consider the detection of 18 cases by Feb 4, 2020 in Singapore to be a gold standard of near-perfect detection,” said the report’s authors, adding that they had used a model to estimate the probability of detection in other countries relative to Singapore. \n The world is detecting imported cases of Covid-19 at 38 per cent of Singapore’s ability to do so, said four epidemiologists from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in the study, that has not yet been peer-reviewed. \n “Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the Covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection,” said the researchers. \n The pre-print report, which was uploaded on online medical archive medRxiv, looked at aggregated data of imported cases as of Feb 4 from the World Health Organization (WHO), taking into account 191 territories around the world. \n Imported cases are those with known travel history from China. \n The researchers also compared the records with air travel data from various sources, including the International Air Travel Association, and the surveillance capacity of nations based on the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which last year ranked Singapore’s preparedness for major disease outbreaks below Malaysia and Thailand. \n Using a model to determine how well countries have detected imported cases, the researchers picked Singapore as a benchmark based on its demonstrated ability to pick up confirmed carriers of Sars-CoV-2, the technical name of the virus which causes the disease Covid-19. \n They also cited a previous study, also by a similar team of Harvard researchers, which found that among countries with substantial travel volume, Singapore had “the highest ratio of detected imported cases to daily travel volume”. \n The previous study named Singapore as a statistical anomaly which had 12 more reported import cases than what had been expected, based on daily travel volume. \n The same report uploaded online last Tuesday had suggested that Indonesia, which has not detected any cases of Covid-19 so far, might have missed cases. The report was called “insulting” by Indonesian Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto earlier this week. \n Harvard Professor Marc Lipsitch said in response to the criticism that the academics had meant to be “helpful” and had conducted the study to see if the total number of detected cases was representative of the actual incidence of Covid-19. \n In the latest study, the researchers, including Prof Lipsitch who was involved in both studies, said their model is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n The researchers said their model in the latest study is 95 per cent statistically reliable. \n High surveillance countries, such as Thailand, Australia and South Korea, came in at 40 per cent of the city-state’s ability to detect imported cases, the study concluded. Low surveillance ones, such as several African and Middle Eastern nations, achieve just 11 per cent of Singapore’s capacity. \n “Put another way, this implies that the true number of cases in travellers is at least 2.8 times the number that has been detected,” the study said. \n However, Singapore’s detection is “probably not 100 per cent efficient”, and the model was also able to estimate that there are around 1.8 undetected cases for every detected Covid-19 patient in the city-state. \n It noted the number of Singapore cases that have no known links to China or any recent travel history. “Singapore’s detection like that in other countries has relied largely on symptoms and travel history, so the number of asymptomatic or low-severity cases missed by such a strategy is unknown,” the authors said. \n What the study implies is that the true number of Covid-19 cases could be higher than previously thought, they added. \n The model proves that the number of undetected cases of coronavirus is correlated to air travel connectivity and is inverse to a country’s detection capacity — and that the risks of the virus going undetected could happen anywhere around the world. \n “(This could lead) to the potential risk of self-sustained transmission, which may be an early stage of a global pandemic,” the study said. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING — Under fire for its response to the coronavirus epidemic, China’s authoritarian government appears to be pushing a new account of events that presents President Xi Jinping as taking early action to fight the outbreak that has convulsed the country. \n But in doing so, authorities have acknowledged for the first time that Mr Xi was aware of the epidemic and involved in the response nearly two weeks before he first spoke publicly about it — and while officials at its epicentre in the city of Wuhan were still playing down its dangers. \n That new account risks drawing the president, China’s most powerful leader in decades, directly into questions about whether top officials did too little, too late. \n In an internal speech published Saturday, Mr Xi said he had “issued demands about the efforts to prevent and control” the coronavirus Jan 7, during a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest council of the Communist Party, whose sessions are typically cloaked in secrecy. \n In the speech, he also said he had authorised the unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan and other cities beginning Jan 23. \n “I have at every moment monitored the spread of the epidemic and progress in efforts to curtail it, constantly issuing oral orders and also instructions,” Mr Xi said of his more recent involvement. \n Mr Xi’s advisers may have hoped that publishing the speech, delivered Feb 3, would dispel speculation about his recent retreat from public view and reassure his people that he can be trusted to lead them out of the epidemic. The virus so far has officially infected more than 68,000 people and killed more than 1,650 worldwide, the vast majority in mainland China. \n “The overall tone of the speech appears to be defensive,” said Dr Minxin Pei, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. “He wants to change the narrative, which until this point has been very unfavourable to the top leadership.” \n Delivered at a meeting with top party officials, when the epidemic had already spiraled into a national crisis, the speech could expose Mr Xi to criticism that he didn’t treat the initial threat urgently enough and make it difficult for him to shift blame onto local officials for what many see as the government’s early mishandling of the epidemic. \n The remarks also raise questions about what top leaders knew at the time and what instructions they issued based on that knowledge. \n That Mr Xi convened a meeting of China’s highest political body in early January indicates that the coronavirus was already being seen as a matter of high-level concern — making his subsequent silence even more conspicuous, experts said. \n An official account of the Jan 7 Standing Committee meeting issued at the time by Xinhua, the state news agency, made no mention of a discussion of the coronavirus. \n “It seems like he’s trying to indicate that ‘We weren’t asleep at the wheel,’” said Dr Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “But it comes off like, ‘We knew this was a problem, but we weren’t sounding the alarm.’” \n In the speech this month, Mr Xi signaled his displeasure with lower-level bureaucrats for their “shortcomings” in implementing the party’s top-level directives. \n In early January, officials in Wuhan were giving open assurances that human-to-human transmission of the virus was unlikely. Some government experts agreed. \n “For now, it seems there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission,” Dr Xu Jianguo, a senior expert on communicable diseases at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview in early January with Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper. “This shows that the threat level from this virus is limited.” \n The new information places Mr Xi’s involvement in fighting the epidemic much earlier than was previously known. His earliest public comment on the epidemic came Jan 20, when he gave brief instructions that were published in state media. \n In the days after Mr Xi’s Jan 7 orders were issued, politicians in Wuhan met for the annual meeting of the city’s People’s Congress, its party-controlled legislature. Over that time, the Wuhan health commission’s daily bulletins on the outbreak said repeatedly that there were no new cases of infection, no firm evidence of human-to-human transmission and no infection of medical workers. \n But signs were growing that politicians and government experts underestimated the potency of the new coronavirus. On Jan 9, a 61-year-old man surnamed Zeng died — the earliest confirmed fatality from the virus. Already, some doctors in Wuhan hospitals were worried enough to warn friends and propose special wards for patients showing symptoms of infection. \n Even after Mr Xi made his first public remarks about the epidemic Jan 20, he mostly kept it at the bottom of his public agenda. On the day before the Chinese New Year holiday began in late January, he took the stage at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing and declared his success in guiding China through a difficult year — making no mention of the virus that was already spreading fear throughout the country. \n In the days after, he all but disappeared from public view, emerging only a handful of times to preside over Communist Party meetings and to meet foreign visitors, including the director-general of the World Health Organization and Cambodia’s autocratic leader, Mr Hun Sen. \n In the meantime, he directed China’s No. 2 leader, Mr Li Keqiang, to lead the group handling the emergency, effectively turning him into the public face of the response. \n For days, Mr Xi’s absence from public view fueled speculation that he was trying to shield his own reputation by taking a back seat in the fast-unfolding crisis. In the past week, he has returned to centre stage in an apparent effort to swat away such talk. \n This past week, Mr Xi went to a neighbourhood centre in Beijing, a hospital and a centre for disease control in what state media billed as a visit to the “front line” of China’s efforts to combat the epidemic. He has yet to visit Hubei, the province at the centre of the epidemic. \n A few days later, Mr Xi fired two top Communist Party officials in Hubei, a move intended to calm simmering public anger and contain the political fallout. \n By publishing the Feb 3 speech now, experts said, Mr Xi appears to be staking his reputation on the outcome of the epidemic fight. \n “What’s really interesting in the speech is, there’s a lot of the word ‘I’ in it,” said Dr Blanchette, of Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “This is clearly putting himself at the centre of Beijing’s response to this while also falling back on the old excuse of blaming cadres for long-standing pathologies of China’s political system.” \n The Feb 3 speech was published by Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, the Communist Party’s top doctrinal journal. It is rare for such an internal speech to be published in full so quickly. THE NEW YORK TIMES \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "北京-由于其对冠状病毒流行的反应，中国的专制政府似乎正在推动一项新的报道，表明习近平主席正在采取早期行动来抗击已经使这个国家震惊的疫情。\n但在这样做的过程中，当局首次承认，在习近平首次公开谈论这一疫情前近两周，他已经意识到这一疫情，并参与了应对行动——尽管其震中武汉市的官员仍在淡化这一疫情的危险性。\n这一新账户有可能让这位数十年来中国最有权势的领导人直接陷入高层官员是否做得太少、太晚的问题。\n在星期六发表的一次内部讲话中，习近平说，他在1月7日中共最高委员会政治局常委会议上“就预防和控制冠状病毒的工作提出了要求”，而政治局常委的会议通常都是保密的。\n他在讲话中还说，他已授权从1月23日开始对武汉和其他城市实施前所未有的封锁。\n习近平在谈到他最近的参与时说：“我时刻都在监测疫情的蔓延和遏制疫情的努力进展，不断发出口头命令和指示。”。\n习近平的顾问们可能希望，发表2月3日发表的讲话，能够打消外界对他最近退出公众视线的猜测，并让他的人民放心，他可以被信任带领他们走出疫情。迄今为止，该病毒已正式感染全球6.8万多人，造成1650多人死亡，其中绝大多数在中国大陆。\n加州克莱蒙特麦肯纳学院（Claremont McKenna College）政府学教授裴敏欣（Minxin Pei）博士说：“演讲的整体基调似乎是防御性的。”. “他想改变这种说法，在这之前，这种说法对最高领导层非常不利。”\n在与党的高级官员的会议上发表，当时疫情已经升级为全国性危机，讲话可能会让习近平受到批评，认为他对最初的威胁处理得不够紧急，并使他很难把责任推到地方官员身上，因为许多人认为政府对疫情的早期处理不当。\n这些言论还引发了一些问题，即最高领导人当时知道什么，他们根据这些知识发布了什么指示。\n专家们说，习近平在1月初召集了中国最高政治机构的一次会议，这表明冠状病毒已经被视为一个引起高度关注的问题，这使得他随后的沉默更加引人注目。\n国家通讯社新华社当时发表的1月7日常委会会议的官方报道没有提及对冠状病毒的讨论。\n战略与国际研究中心（Centre for Strategic and International Studies）的弗里曼（Freeman）中国研究主席朱德•布兰切特（Jude Blanchette）博士说：“他似乎在暗示‘我们没有在开车时睡着’。”。“但结果是，‘我们知道这是个问题，但我们没有发出警报。’”\n在本月的讲话中，习近平表达了他对下级官僚在执行党的最高指示方面的“缺点”的不满。\n今年1月初，武汉市官员公开保证，这种病毒不太可能在人与人之间传播。一些政府专家表示同意。\n“目前看来，还没有明确的人与人之间传播的证据，”中国疾病预防控制中心传染病高级专家Xu Jianguo博士在一月初接受香港报纸大公报的采访时说。“这表明来自该病毒的威胁级别是有限的.”\n新的信息显示，习近平参与抗击艾滋病的时间要比先前所知早得多。他最早对疫情发表公开评论是在1月20日，当时他发表了简短的指示，并在官方媒体上发表。\n在习近平1月7日的命令发布后的几天里，武汉的政界人士举行了武汉市人民代表大会年会，该市由党控制的立法机构。那段时间，武汉市卫生委员会每天发布的疫情通报反复表示，没有新的感染病例，没有确凿的人传人证据，也没有医务人员感染。\n但越来越多的迹象表明，政治家和政府专家低估了这种新型冠状病毒的威力。1月9日，一名61岁的曾姓男子死亡，这是最早确认的病毒致死病例。武汉一些医院的医生已经很担心了，他们警告朋友，并建议为出现感染症状的病人设立专门的病房。\n即使在1月20日习近平首次公开发表有关艾滋病的言论之后，他也基本上把它放在了公共议程的最底层。在1月下旬春节假期开始的前一天，他在北京人民大会堂登台，宣布成功地引导中国度过了艰难的一年——没有提到已经在全国传播恐惧的病毒。\n此后几天，他几乎从公众视野中消失，只出现了几次主持共产党会议和会见外国访客的机会，其中包括世界卫生组织总干事和柬埔寨独裁领导人洪森。\n与此同时，他指示中国第二大领导人李克强领导处理紧急情况的小组，有效地使他成为公众面对的反应.\n连日来，习近平缺席公众视线，引发外界猜测，他试图在迅速发展的危机中退居二线，以保护自己的声誉。在过去的一周里，他回到了舞台的中心，显然是为了阻止这样的谈话。\n在过去的一周里，习近平去了北京的一个社区中心、一家医院和一个疾病控制中心，官方媒体称这是访问中国抗击艾滋病的“前线”。他还没有访问湖北省，该省是疫情的中心。\n几天后，习近平在湖北解雇了两名中共高官，此举意在平息民愤，遏制政治影响。\n专家们说，习近平现在发表2月3日的讲话，似乎是把自己的声誉押在抗击疫情的成果上。\n战略与国际研究中心的布兰切特博士说：“演讲中真正有趣的是，有很多‘我’这个词。”。“这显然是把自己放在了北京回应这一问题的中心，同时也回到了指责中国政治体制长期病态的干部的老借口上。”\n2月3日的讲话由中共最高理论刊物《求是》发表。这样一篇内部讲话如此迅速地全文发表，实属罕见。纽约时报",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Customers who placed orders for parcels from China after the middle of January can expect delays due to the Covid-19 outbreak and extended Chinese New Year break in China, e-commerce companies told TODAY on Friday (Feb 14). \n TODAY spoke to 10 customers of e-commerce companies Ezbuy, Qoo10, Lazada and Shopee, who said that their orders had been delayed or cancelled as retailers in China had not dispatched their items, and had not given them reasons for the holdup. \n A Lazada spokesperson said that delays are expected for orders placed after Jan 20 due to the extended Chinese New Year holiday in China implemented because of the Covid-19 outbreak, and the wider implications of the outbreak. \n “We are expecting orders placed after Jan 20 to have processing and shipping delays,” the spokesperson told TODAY. \n “We have communicated this to affected customers and offered to facilitate cancellation for those who wished to,” the spokesperson said, but declined to comment on whether cancellation policies will be different during this period. \n Lazada is closely monitoring the situation and working with its partners to help sellers. \n “As the shopping experience for our consumers continues to be our top priority, we are exercising all efforts to better match the demand with supply by leveraging our technology and logistics capabilities within Lazada and the Alibaba economy,” the spokesperson added. \n Lazada is controlled by China's e-commerce giant Alibaba. \n An Ezbuy spokesperson said there had been some parcel delays caused by a pause in operations by manufacturers, suppliers, couriers and logistics firms. \n \"However, with more suppliers resuming their operations this week, including domestic couriers and international logistic companies, we have observed that things are gradually progressing and we remain hopeful about the situation,\" the spokesperson added. \n A Shopee spokesperson said that customers can expect delays due to the extended Chinese New Year period as sellers in China are trying to resume operations. \n “We are working closely with our sellers and delivery partners to ensure orders are fulfilled as quickly as possible,” the spokesperson said. \n “In the meantime, we will continue to closely monitor the Covid-19 situation, and we remain committed to protecting the well-being of our users during this time,” the spokesperson said. \n POSSIBLE REASONS FOR DELAYED ORDERS \n Assistant Professor Yuen Kum Fai at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) School of Civil and Environmental Engineering said that the delays of orders could be due to the cancellation of freight services, resulting in a shortage of the items. \n “I believe the delays are caused by both international and domestic shipping. However, restricted international flights might be a bigger contributor to delays,” he said. \n He added that increased health measures for drivers could have slowed down local transportation of goods in China. \n “The increase in administration, health screening and checks on drivers could further slow down the process,” he said. \n Professor Lawrence Loh at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School said that the delays could be due to a shortage of workers at manufacturing companies, warehouses and transport companies due to the outbreak. \n “Workers could not be going back to their companies due to health reasons as they may be quarantined,” he said. “Or they could be fearful to return.” \n He added that e-commerce sites can turn to exporters from other countries such as South Korea or India instead of China during this period. \n Mr Lucas Tok, a lecturer at the Singapore Polytechnic School of Business, said that e-commerce companies here could find it difficult to inform customers about the reasons for delayed orders as the companies might not know why either. \n “The situation in China is changing very quickly and there needs to be fast decisions made on the ground there regarding the businesses,” he said. “There might be a mismatch of information and not regular updates between China and companies here.” \n DELAYED OR CANCELLED ORDERS \n Customers of e-commerce sites said that their orders were cancelled as retailers in China did not dispatch their items and did not give reasons for it. \n Ms Kelly Poon, 39, who works in customer service, said that her Ezbuy parcel that she placed on Jan 19 has still not arrived as the retailer in China has not dispatched it. \n “I asked Ezbuy about it and there wasn't really a good reply,” she said. “I was just asked to wait, with no estimated timeline or prompt updates.” \n Undergraduate Joel Ng, 26, said that of the 10 orders of household items that he has placed on Aliexpress since Jan 25, only two were shipped out to Singapore, which occurred on Feb 9. \n “From past experience, they ship out within two to three days,” he said, adding that he cancelled some of them because he was tired of waiting and bought them locally instead. \n He has two orders that have yet to be shipped out by the seller in China. \n “I’m quite annoyed but never mind, a lot of them are impulse buys so they are not necessities,” he said. \n A Shopee retailer, happishop, wrote in an automated reply that it apologises for possible delays in deliveries. \n “We apologise that due to the global coronavirus outbreak and disruptions to our supply chain, we are still experiencing difficulties in fulfilling your order,” it wrote. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Ms Sheryl Teo, 26, and her fiance Mr Bryan Cheong, 28, are not letting the Covid-19 outbreak stand in the way of a Valentine’s Day tradition they have maintained for four years. \n Ms Teo, who works in corporate communications, and Mr Cheong, a digital marketing executive, will be heading down to Tanjong Beach Club in Sentosa on Friday (Feb 14) night just as they initially planned. \n “Ever since our first Valentine’s Day together four years ago, we’ve been going to Sentosa beach for dinner and drinks to celebrate, and we planned to keep this tradition,” said Ms Teo. \n When they heard that Singapore’s first confirmed Covid-19 case was related to Sentosa, the pair discussed breaking this tradition to stay home and watch Netflix, but chose to wait and see before making a decision. A 66-year-old man from Wuhan, China tested positive to Covid-19 last month after staying at Shangri-La’s Rasa Sentosa. \n A few weeks later, the couple felt confident in Singapore’s ability to keep Covid-19 in check, and chose to keep up their romantic tradition. \n “Our mindset is that, ironically, the places in Singapore right now with confirmed cases of the virus are actually the cleanest places, because so much effort has been spent to make sure that these places are now disinfected. So Sentosa is actually pretty ideal for us now,” Ms Teo said. \n Mr Cheong said: “Most Singaporeans my age that I know aren’t really bothered by the outbreak. We don’t wear facemasks when we head out, although we wash our hands more often.” \n Ms Teo added: “I guess going ahead with our Valentine’s Day plan is my way of actively choosing not to let the virus affect my life any further than it should.” \n In the same way, Mr Chua Kok Teng, 44, is undeterred by the Covid-19 outbreak from taking his wife out to dinner tonight. \n But instead of dining in a restaurant at Dempsey Hill or Tanjong Pagar like they usually do on Valentine’s Day, the couple will spend this year’s occasion supping on ma la hot pot at an open air eatery. \n “We have never had ma la together, so my wife chose a place near our home in Clementi,” said Mr Chua, who is an engineer in the oil and gas industry. The pair do not drive, and decided to eat close to where they live in order to avoid taking transport to town. \n Other couples whom TODAY spoke to also had the Covid-19 outbreak in the back of their minds when planning for their Valentine’s Day celebrations. \n For their first Valentine’s Day together, Ms Angie Ching, 22, a student at Singapore Institute of Management, and her boyfriend Mr Tan Jun Xiong, 23, will be taking a long bus ride instead of their originally-planned MRT trip to their dinner spot at Bendemeer, in a bid to minimise the number of people they come in close contact with. \n Ms Ching reasoned that a bus typically has fewer passengers than a train. \n The lovebirds also initially wanted to spend the entirety of Saturday together, but decided to just have lunch and a karaoke session that day instead. \n Ms Ching said she felt sad and upset when she first feared they would have to scrap their romantic evening, as the duo have barely had time to be alone with one another in the last month due to the Chinese New Year celebrations and Mr Tan working on weekdays. \n Now that they elected to continue with most of their plans since they believe the outbreak situation here is under control, Ms Ching said: “I feel excited but a little wary, because the virus is still here in Singapore, and we have to stay vigilant and extra careful.” \n Mr Tan, who is working as an accountant while waiting for his university term to start, told TODAY: “Life still goes on, as long as we take care of ourselves and take a little more precaution during this period of time, then there’s no need to make it seem as though the world has stopped.” \n “Also, it’s our first Valentine’s together, a day where couples celebrate their love for each other. Why would we want to miss this?” \n Another couple, Mr Gareth Yeo, 33, who works as an IT specialist, and his wife Ms Sharon Yu, 32, a nurse working in a general hospital ward, will be spending most of their Valentine’s Day at home, making popiah for lunch, catching an afternoon movie on the sofa and having a quiet dinner at a restaurant in Sembawang. \n However, the reason they chose to remain indoors was not out of fear they might catch Covid-19, but rather because they felt that Ms Yu needed some extra rest. \n After working almost non-stop for the past seven days as part of her shift schedule, Ms Yu said it was a coincidence that one of her off-days fell on Valentine’s Day, and it was the perfect opportunity for her to spend time with her husband. \n “When I’m on night shift, I don’t get to see him at all, because he comes home at 7.30pm and I leave at 7pm, and when I come back in the morning he is already off to work,” she said. \n Mr Yeo, who took a leave day on Friday to be with his wife, planned the whole day for them both. \n “It feels like she was gone for a very long time, and now she’s back. She’s been very focused on her work for the past few days, and she’s simply had no time for other activities besides sleep, work, and cooking some simple meals,” he said. \n “I think she deserves some time to unwind after having such hectic working days,” he added. \n One couple refused to let Covid-19 alter their Valentine’s Day arrangements at all. \n Mr Yuen, 60, and Mrs Yuen, 58, who wish to be known only by their surnames, said that while their Valentine’s Day plans were simple, they would still continue with them as planned. \n “I’m not overly concerned, we just have to make sure we take the necessary precautions. So we won’t have any changes in our plan,” said Mr Yuen, who works as group head of engagement and programs at the Centre for Fathering. \n The couple have been married for 31 years with three grown children, and will be going out on Saturday evening for vegan food, which they said they have been experimenting with recently. \n Mrs Yuen, who is a project manager, said: “We usually take time off and do dinner, but our objective is to connect with one another. We are not so concerned about the flowers and champagne.” \n “We believe that a relationship isn’t just about Valentine’s Day. If you make time for each other, every day can be Valentine’s Day,” she added. \n Mr Chua said: “Naturally I am very worried about the outbreak. But I guess ultimately if we stick to the basic rules for personal hygiene, there will be many couples who can just have their usual Valentine’s Day programme.” \n “At the end of the day, there’s never a 100 per cent guarantee that you will be safe, and you can only worry so much. I guess you just have to strike a balance.” \n   \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (REUTERS) - The existence of a substantial but unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that people could still be spreading Covid-19 without knowing they are sick. \n As the virus continues to wreak havoc across the world, China is close to declaring victory and is already easing travel restrictions. \n The border of Hubei province, epicentre of the virus, opened on Wednesday (March 25) after a two-month shutdown. \n But there are concerns that the end of the lockdown will release thousands of infectious people back into circulation. \n Asymptomatic cases present a huge challenge in the control of infectious diseases, making it harder to detect and stop transmission. \n In China, the number of known asymptomatic cases is classified, and it is not included in the official data, though the South China Morning Post, citing unpublished official documents, recently said it was more than 40,000. \n China had reported 81,218 coronavirus cases, and 3,281 deaths by the end of Tuesday. \n Asymptomatic cases are currently found through \"contact tracing\". China identifies people exposed to someone with a confirmed diagnosis, and if they test positive, they are quarantined whether or not they manifest symptoms. \n \"Asymptomatic patients have all been discovered during our contact tracing,\" said Dr Wu Zunyou of the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention at a briefing on Tuesday. \n \"So will they be able to create transmission? They won't.\" \n Still, the failure to include them in the official data has raised concerns about Beijing's commitment to transparency, and some experts say it could also create a misleading picture about how the epidemic spreads and whether or not it is under control. \n Despite recording zero new infections from last Wednesday to Sunday, the Covid-19 hot spot city of Wuhan disclosed last Friday that one newly diagnosed case was not included in the official data because the patient, a 62-year-old man surnamed Zhang, had shown no symptoms. \n Citing hospital sources, the news magazine Caixin also reported that a new case in Wuhan on Tuesday was a doctor who had been infected by an asymptomatic patient. \n China says asymptomatic patients will be added to the list of confirmed patients if they show symptoms at a later stage. \n But it remains unclear how many asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed and therefore unquarantined. \n Some experts warn that undetected, asymptomatic patients could create fresh transmission routes once lockdowns are eased. \n \"It is especially concerning given that many countries have yet to implement sufficient levels of widespread community testing,\" said Mr Adam Kamradt-Scott, a public health specialist at the University of Sydney. \n It is also unclear how much they might infect others. \n \"We know that that is possible, but we do not believe that that's a major driver of transmission,\" said Dr Maria Van Kerkhove of the World Health Organisation at a briefing early in March. \n New studies show that asymptomatic carriers could pose risks. One analysis of the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak showed that 33 of the 104 infected passengers remained asymptomatic even after an average of 10 days of observation at the Self-Defence Forces Central Hospital in Japan. \n While many appeared healthy throughout, a few other initially asymptomatic passengers quickly became seriously ill. \n Another study published on Monday, looking at cases in the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing, said 18 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. \n Another even found that people are more likely to transmit the disease when symptoms are at their mildest. \n The Yale School of Public Health said the existence of pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic patients meant that screening procedures at airports and other points of entry were insufficient to prevent the coronavirus passing from China to other countries. \n \"The real picture will only come to light when we have a serological test to find out who has been infected,\" said Dr Ian Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at Queensland University. \n ",

US President Donald Trump has pointedly and repeatedly called Covid-19 a \"Chinese virus\" - a term that stigmatises that nation, while a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official promoted conspiracy theories that the virus was brought to China by the US military. Neither, of course, is correct. Health experts have been quick to point out that pandemics have no nationality or ethnicity, and the use of terms which imply that viruses do have ethnic origins can, and indeed have led to discriminatory practices. \n But this is also more than a problem of discrimination. The pandemic is now threatening to derail a US-China relationship that was just starting to stabilise. Continued name-calling will hamper global coordination at a time when it is most in need. That the pandemic has become the latest irritant in their bilateral relationship is perhaps not surprising. The politics of the moment plays very much into the nativist, nationalist tendencies that is seeing a resurgence globally. Having watched the pandemic wreak havoc on the economic growth that he tied so closely to his own political fate, Mr Trump senses some advantages in portraying the crisis as a foreign threat. White House officials highlighted criticisms of China's handling of the virus in the outbreak's early days - saying the pandemic could have been avoided if Beijing had done the right thing at the start. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (AFP) - It was supposed to be a whirlwind tour of China for Ms Jiang Lanyi's boyfriend: classical gardens in Suzhou, modern art in Shanghai, ice-skating in central Beijing. \n Instead, the 24-year-old and her Ukrainian partner have spent more than two weeks holed up in her parents' house in north-east Liaoning province to avoid the coronavirus. \n Couples around China settled for a quiet Valentine's Day this year, with Covid-19 intruding as an unwelcome third-wheel in romantic celebrations. \n The new disease has infected nearly 64,000 people and killed more than 1,350 in China, triggering transport restrictions, restaurant shutdowns, and the closure of major tourist sites. \n Businesses around the country from florists to concert halls closed shop and axed events, leaving couples with no choice but to spend the night in. \n For Ms Jiang and her boyfriend, that meant a lot of mahjong. \n \"We play two to three hours every day,\" said Ms Jiang, who met her partner, a tech entrepreneur, while studying in London. \n \"Having started learning from zero, he's now very skilled,\" she added. \n In Beijing, Valentine's Day specials aimed at couples - from a My Heart Will Go On concert to a 1,688 yuan (S$335) lobster dinner for two - were cancelled. \n Valentine's Day this year \"won't be that different from daily life under quarantine,\" said Ms Tyra Li, who lives in Beijing with her boyfriend of nearly three years. \n Since Lunar New Year, aside from a trip to see family, the couple has only left the house to buy groceries - they don't even order food delivery for fear of infection, she said. \n People wearing protective masks walk in a shopping mall decorated for Valentine's Day in Beijing, China, on Feb 12, 2020. PHOTO: EPA-EFE\n  \n \"There definitely won't be any flowers,\" the 33-year-old told AFP. \"I don't dare to receive them and he doesn't dare to buy them.\" \n The risk of infection, which has left most lovers house-bound, has battered Valentine's Day sales for businesses hoping to cash in on love. \n Flower shop Xian Hua Ge in Beijing told AFP that sales plunged by up to 70 per cent from last year - partly because many have not returned to the city to work. \n Ms Lu Ting, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a Tuesday (Feb 11) report that the \"return rate\" of workers for China's four Tier-1 cities was only 19.4 per cent as of Feb 9, far below 66.7 per cent a year ago. \n A worker at Romanti Fresh Flowers said sales had dropped up to 50 per cent in part because customers were fearful of virus transmission via delivery staff, while another shop told AFP they had \"no stock\". \n China's wedding industry has also taken a hit, with the Chinese government urging couples to delay their nuptials earlier this month. \n Ms Zhu He, 25, who downsized her wedding due to virus fears last month, said she and her fiance had originally planned to pick up their marriage license on Valentine's Day. \n That's been delayed due to the epidemic, said Ms Zhu, who lives in southern Guangzhou city. \n \"We had planned to go together (with my parents),\" she told AFP. \"Now, they won't come even though we all live in Guangzhou.\" \n \"They both can't drive and I don't really trust public transport,\" said Ms Zhu, worried about the risk of infection. \n The coronavirus has also complicated romantic trysts, with many cities across China closing off neighbourhoods to outside visitors in a bid to contain the outbreak. \n Ms Miao Jing, a university student in northern Tianjin city, said her girlfriend had to sneak into her hotel through the car park for a three-hour rendezvous earlier this month. \n The trip was supposed to last three days, explained the 23-year-old, who took a five-hour train to northern Zhangjiakou city to see her partner. \n But on the second day, the district where Ms Miao was staying reported a confirmed case of the virus. \"She was really worried,\" Ms Miao told AFP. \"In the end, I only saw her on the first day.\" \n An empty shopping mall ahead of Valentine's Day in Beijing, China, on Feb 12, 2020. PHOTO: EPA-EFE \n For Ms Shaw Wan, 28, who works on short documentaries in Beijing, the epidemic has separated her and her boyfriend - who is in Taiwan - indefinitely. \n \"I don't really want him to return either - what if he gets infected on the way back?\" she told AFP. \n But there is some silver lining to the Covid-19 outbreak. \n Ms Li in Beijing said staying cooped up at home had meant more time with her boyfriend - in the past, their busy schedules meant they only saw each other after 10pm on weekdays. \n And for Ms Miao and her girlfriend, who are in a long-distance relationship, volunteering in epidemic relief work has brought them closer together. \n The two students help residents and communities in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, with remote tasks like calling to arrange car transport. \n \"There is a feeling of working together,\" she told AFP. \"Even if we cannot be together physically, in some sense we are.\" \n ",

It is closed on Jan 1, 2020. \n On Jan 9, the WHO says that the outbreak in Wuhan was caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, which is a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like Sars. \n To date, 59 people have been infected, of whom seven are in a serious condition, according to an official toll. \n The Chinese health authorities say a first person died of the virus on Jan 11. They revise downwards the number of sick people to 41. \n On Jan 13, the virus spreads beyond China's borders for the first time, with a case emerging in Thailand, according to the WHO. The victim is a Chinese woman diagnosed with mild pneumonia who was returning from a trip to Wuhan. \n On Jan 15, China's health commission says no human-to-human transmission of the virus behind the Wuhan outbreak has been confirmed so far, but the possibility \"cannot be excluded\". \n The next day, a first case of the virus is confirmed in Japan in someone who had stayed in Wuhan in early January. \n On Jan 17, a second person, a 69-year-old man, dies in Wuhan, according to the authorities. \n The same day, the CDC announces that it will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan at three airports: San Francisco, New York's JFK and Los Angeles. \n On Jan 20, a third death and more than 100 new cases are announced in China, sparking concerns ahead of the annual Chinese New Year holiday which begins on Jan 25 and sees hundreds of millions of Chinese people travel nationwide. \n The virus is present in Beijing in the north, Shanghai in the east and Shenzhen in the south. More than 200 cases have been recorded. The virus is also detected in South Korea in a Chinese person who arrived by plane from Wuhan. \n China's President Xi Jinping says that the virus must be \"resolutely contained\", in his first public comments on the outbreak. \n Human-to-human transmission is \"affirmative\", a top Chinese expert on infectious diseases Zhong Nanshan tells state broadcaster CCTV. \n ",

The first patients to fully recover in the region have already left hospital, according to official media. \n Over 1,100 people have died in China due to the coronavirus epidemic although most of the deaths and infections have been in the central Hubei province, whose capital, Wuhan, is the epicentre of the outbreak. \n But representatives of the Uighur diaspora warn there is real reason to fear a rapid spread of coronavirus in the controversial Chinese camps. \n The virus spreads from person to person through droplets disseminated by sneezing or coughing, and confining large groups of people together, possibly without adequate access to germ-killing soap and water, will increase the likelihood of an outbreak. \n China has rounded up an estimated one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic minorities in internment camps, NGOs and experts say, and little is known about the conditions inside them. \n Beijing insists the camps are \"vocational training centres\" necessary to combat terrorism. \n \"People are starting to panic. Our families are there, dealing with the camps and the virus, and we do not know if they have enough to eat or if they have masks,\" said Dilnur Reyhan, a French sociologist of Uighur origin. \n A petition posted on Change.org signed by over 3,000 people urges the closure of the camps to reduce the threat. \n There have also been social media hashtag campaigns such as #VirusThreatInThecamps and #WHO2Urumqi to urge the World Health Organisation (WHO) to send a delegation to the city of Xinjiang. \n \"We must not wait until news of hundreds of coronavirus-related deaths in the camps before we react,\" the petition says. \n \"As China continues to struggle to contain the virus in Wuhan, we can easily assume the virus will rapidly spread throughout the camps and affect millions if we don't raise the alarm now.\" \n Regional authorities in Xinjiang did not respond to a query from AFP about measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus in the camps. \n The World Uyghur Congress (WUC), one of several groups representing Uighurs outside China, said it was very concerned \"that if measures are not taken to further limit the spread of this virus, it could rapidly infect large numbers of people\" in Xinjiang. \n \"These people are in a vulnerable and weakened state due to the Chinese government's abuses and mistreatment,\" said its president Dolkun Isa. \n \"This has just further compounded the suffering of the Uighur people, as our friends and family are now in even greater danger.\" \n French immunologist Norbert Gualde said it was impossible to say precisely under what conditions the Uighurs and other detainees are living in Chinese camps. \n \"There are good reasons to think that their detention is synonymous with imposed proximity, stress and fear - all circumstances that favour the transmission of a virus between those obliged to remain incarcerated,\" he said. \n ",

In addition, thousands of Chinese currently work and live in the Cape Verde archipelagoYeah.\nThe emergency plan defines the need, by \"country's health safety\", to ensure \"effective responses\" during the various stages, which began with the \"preparation and status of permanent alert\", implementing the \"early detection capability of the virus\" and will proceed with \"immediate containment to avoid the risk of spreading\".",
