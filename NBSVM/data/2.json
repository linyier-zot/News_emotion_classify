We'll urge Hubei province and the city of Wuhan to take the strictest measures for prevention and control,\" Li Bin, vice-minister of the National Health Commission, said on Wednesday.\nSuch measures include intensifying supervision of open-air markets, minimising public activities, taking the strictest measures regarding people with fever and preventing the outbreak from further spreading, he said at a news conference organized by the State Council Information Office.\nThe Wuhan government required all people in public places such as hotels, restaurants, cinemas, parks, shopping centres and public transports to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus, according to an announcement on Wednesday night. The rule took effect immediately.\nOn Wednesday night, Hubei province with capital Wuhan reported 444 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the province alone.\nThe disease further spread across the country as health authorities in Shanxi, Fujian, Gui¬zhou and Hebei provinces, as well as the Ningxia Hui autonomous region, confirmed their first infection cases. Beijing has already reported some cases.\nHong Kong and Macau too have reported such cases.\n\"Human-to-human transmission of the disease has appeared, and the virus is likely to mutate. There are risks of the further spread of the disease,\" Li said, adding the ongoing traffic peak with the upcoming Spring Festival has increased the risk of its spreading, which requires a high state of alert.\n\nChina's National Health Commission had received reports of one confirmed case in Japan, one in South Korea and three in Thailand by Tuesday midnight, Li said.\nIn the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed on Tuesday the first case in the country in Seattle.\nGao Fu, head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said there is no evidence so far showing that a super-spreader, or a highly contagious virus, has emerged\n.\nHe added that, based on current evidence, the virus originated from wild animals sold at a seafood market in Wuhan.\nIn Hubei, the provincial government early on Wednesday announced that it had activated its emergency public health response mechanism to effectively prevent the spread of the virus.\nLocal authorities will strictly control the number of outbound activities such as conferences, tours and visits, and large gatherings are banned.\nMeasures will also be taken to prevent the spread of the virus through public transport, and prevent sources of it from entering schools, according to the announcement.\nWuhan authorities announced that all local tourism agencies, including their branches outside the city, will suspend business and will not organize tours until February 8.\nAll tours scheduled to start after January 30 will be cancelled.\nThe city government has also called for residents not to leave Wuhan and outsiders not to enter the city if there's no particular need, to reduce the risk of the virus spreading further.\n",

Although some of the masks were priced up, legislator Lin Yufeng observed that within two or three hours, the masks on the market had been taken out of stock. In order to prevent confusion, the government immediately announced that the masks should be given to residents as soon as possible today, and many casinos in mainland China were staffed yesterday At midnight, the government ordered casino staff to wear masks.\nThe Macao government announced that from tonight, Macao residents with ID cards and external labor cards can purchase 10 masks at a price of mop 8 in more than 50 pharmacies, and only once in 10 days. Li zhanrun, director of the Bureau of health, said that the government had ordered more than 20 million masks to arrive before the Spring Festival. It is expected that each resident can have more than 40 masks, which can cope with more than 40 days based on one per person per day.\nMask market breaking crisis in Hong Kong during Spring Festival\nIn Hong Kong, the government does not have a mask rationing plan. With two cases of \"highly suspected\" infection yesterday, the rush to buy them immediately followed. Liu Aiguo, vice president of the General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong and Kowloon pharmacies, said in a radio program this morning that although the pharmacies had already added masks earlier, most of the masks in drug rooms in Hong Kong have been \"out of stock\". His pharmacies sold more than 10000 masks yesterday. He added that the pharmacy will be closed in the coming spring and may not be able to replenish until the 10th of the year (February 3).\nIn the rush to buy, businesses have their own strategies. In addition to raising the price, some businesses have increased the price to launch a mask that was pointed out to have quality problems in Japan at the beginning of last year. Some buyers have pointed out on the Internet that the packaging Wuchang, but they found that the mask only had one layer when it was used, and it is still used without protection. Other netizens suspect that Chinese manufacturers, commissioned by Japanese businesses to make masks, dumped their products in Hong Kong that had been produced but not destroyed.\nIt's still hard to forbid price hikers to work overtime in China\nIn mainland China, price hikes of masks are common. Authorities in Beijing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai and Chengdu have successively issued notices asking drugstores and other sellers not to raise prices. The market supervision bureau said it would investigate and punish all kinds of illegal acts such as price bid up, hoarding and price fraud, and the violators would be given heavier punishment according to law\n。 Among them, Shanghai may impose a maximum fine of less than 3 million yuan; if the circumstances are serious, Shanghai may be ordered to suspend business for rectification or even to nail the brand.\nHowever, businesses in Shanghai still face the wind and violate the rules. According to the economic daily, a supermarket in Minhang District of the city was reported on the 21st, saying that the masks sold by the shop owners on the spot were not priced, but the prices marked on the Internet increased by 20% to 1.6 times. In addition, some businesses raised the price of anti epidemic products from 158 yuan to 398 yuan within three days. The authorities have put the business on file for investigation.\nPrice hikes are also common on multiple online shopping platforms. Take 30 9132 N95 masks with 3M brand as an example. There are Taobao stores that have raised their prices four times to 398 yuan (the same below), and 20 N95 masks with 160S brand have been raised ten times to 998 yuan. By yesterday, Taobao, Jingdong, pinduoduo, Suning e-commerce, hungry and other platforms have successively issued notices to prohibit platform businesses from raising prices when selling masks. Taobao also issued a statement on the official microblog, saying that there are sufficient supplies of masks on the platform at present and that it has provided special subsidies for masks to ensure that consumers can buy genuine masks at affordable prices.\nIn addition, there are also manufacturers of protective equipment to increase wages for employees to sell masks. Chinese media reported that the head of Zhende medical said that the factory had urgently called on employees who were taking Spring Festival leave to work overtime to produce masks and would give priority to CDC and medical institutions. In addition, hengming medicine, which supplies Taobao tmall and other online platforms, recalled employees on holiday to return to work in an emergency on the 21st, paying 3 to 5 times their salaries to workers, and fully reimbursed transportation, accommodation and other expenses to ensure the supply of masks.\n",

Chinese health authorities made a presentation by teleconference and have allowed a WHO team into the country who are due to report back to the panel.  \n A news conference was expected later in the day.  \n Here are some facts about WHO Emergency Committees:  \n  \n - Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Monday that the WHO had called an Emergency Committee to assess the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year.  \n  \n - Declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern - known as a \"PHEIC\" in WHO jargon - is rare.  \n  \n - The WHO panel's recommendations, after assessing any evidence of human-to-human transmission and other factors, would be put to Tedros, who would decide whether to declare an emergency.  \n  \n - Only five emergencies have been declared in the past decade: the H1 virus that caused an influenza pandemic (2009), West Africa's Ebola outbreak, polio (2014), Zika virus (2016), and the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (2019).  \n  \n - The WHO's criteria, laid out in the 2005 International Health Regulations, define a PHEIC as \"an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response\"\n.  \n  \n - Such situations are \"serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected\", carry cross-border implications and may require immediate international action, its rules say.  \n  \n - A declaration would lead to boosting public health measures, funding and resources to prevent and reduce international spread.  \n  \n - It could include recommendations on trade and travel, including airport screening of passengers, although the WHO generally aims to avoid disruptive trade restrictions.

The committee met on Wednesday but did not reach a consensus on the matter.\nThe coronavirus, identified as 2019-nCoV, was detected in December and already caused at least 17 deaths in 616, according to the Chinese authorities. There are already two cities in the country in isolation: Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, and Huanggang, about 70 kilometers away.\n\"The role of the WHO is to ensure that the global public health response to any new outbreak is rapid, robust and comprehensive, especially taking into account the geographical distribution of cases,\" says Jeremy Farrar, director of the non-governmental organisation (NGOs) Wellcome, dedicated to health research.\nIn statements to the Express from Davos, where he participates in the World Economic Forum, the NGO director stresses that \"this outbreak is extremely worrying\". \"Person to person transmission has been confirmed and, as expected, there are an increasing number of cases in China and other countries with infected healthcare workers,\" he added.\nThe virus is transmitted between animals and passed on to humans. However, the circumstances of the transmission from person to person are not yet fully substantiated. The first cases arose in Wuhan in central China and are believed to have originated in a market for seafood and meat from Huanan in that city.\nOutside mainland China, cases were confirmed in South Korea, the USA, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Thailand and Taiwan.\n\"A major concern is the variety of symptoms this virus is causing\nYeah. Some people are being affected and are infectious, although they have only very mild symptoms or possibly not showing any symptoms,\"Jeremy Farrar warned. It suggests, \"This may be masking the true number of infected and the extent of the transmission from person to person.\"\nIn recent days, the spectrum of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has returned, which has infected more than eight thousand people and killed nearly 800 in a pandemic that has spread across Asia between 2002 and 2003. Wellcome's director recalls, however, that \"the speed with which this virus has been identified is evidence of changes in public health in China since SARS and of strong global coordination through WHO\".\n\"The world is much better prepared to identify patients and adopt the necessary clinical and public health measures than during SARS. However, we still do not understand this virus or its clinical impact and public health. We also have no proven vaccines or treatments yet,\"says Jeremy Farrar. \"The CEPI (Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations), which Wellcome supports, is currently working with global partners to accelerate the search for a vaccine for this new virus\", it ensures.\nPending further deliberation by the WHO, which has declared an international public health emergency for the epidemics of H1N1 influenza, polio and Zika-Ebola viruses, Macao authorities have cancelled the Lunar New Year celebrations. The measure had already been adopted by the local authorities of Wuhan. The New Year, which starts this Saturday, is a very special date in the Chinese calendar and takes hundreds of millions of people travelling around the country.\nIn Portugal, the Director General for Health (DGS), thanks to nuns, reported this Wednesday that \"there are no suspicious cases\", so there is no alarm situation.\nAs a precaution, DGS is \"paying more attention\" to the seven cases exported from mainland China\nYeah.

        "news_content_translate_en": "There's a new virus in the world, and the question we all ask is the same: when I come near us? The nCoV (acronym for \"new coronavirus\") was born thousands of kilometers of Latin America, a region remote: no city of the continent is among those that receive more visits from the Chinese provinces affected by a detailed study. And yet, Google searches on \"coronavirus\" have soared in recent days.\nIn all cases, the alarm is for a suspected case. Media and audience are (are) to hunt for the Latin American patient zero of the nCoV. We have already had several discards: one in the Tamaulipas border, another in Cali, another in northern Argentina, several in Brazil under study right now. Chances are that this case comes, sooner or later. Everything moves so fast that it is possible that when you read these lines already have among the owners of the newspaper. But what do you mean exactly? What it will mean for the region that have imported a respiratory virus still poorly understood?\nOur brain perceives better define the risks if dramatically. We need a character (the disease) and a drastic change in the course of events (daily routine) to alert ourselves. But rare disease sometimes behaves under this Hollywood script, however much we try hard to put it into the story. Take, for example, the influenza epidemic (swine) born in Mexico in April 2009. From week to week, the attention of the country (and the world) was overturned on four characters: H1N1. A sense of urgency was quickly caught, as if moved by electrical impulses, reflected for example in relevant Google searches. But the evolution of the epidemic was substantially more gradual.\nWhat's more: slowly, the scientific teams were distilling the real impact addition of the virus, imposing parallel containment measures and necessary response. In the end, it was a contagious disease, yes, and amazingly dangerous for younger (when flu tends to affect especially those over 65). But I did not mean catastrophe in mortality our minds wanted to dramatize: according to an estimate by the Center for Disease Control in the US, H1N1 killed about the same people as seasonal flu, staying below other pandemics last.\nOur brain, however, remains committed to find dramas and is in the seemingly cold numbers. One of these figures, which has captured the attention of the audience on social networks on the nCoV, is known as R0: the average people who become infected from another already infected with a disease. We had just a few weeks when several epidemiologists epidemic drew their estimates. Some clung to the highest figures, once again sounding the alarm messages from the \"contagious coronavirus each affected by three people\" style. But the truth is that these estimates were considerably variables. They always are: even with well-known diseases, the value of the R0 varies greatly according to the study.\nIt's just normal; to the end and Cape, a disease can behave very differently depending on the social context in which it develops. Not be the same a viral outbreak in a place without hygienic conditions and high population density, which in a sparsely populated rural area. That is why even the most contagious diseases, such as measles, offer wide ranges greatly contagion. Also, do not forget that averages can be misleading: if it turns out that the value of contagion from the nCoV in China is 2, this figure is so compatible with the idea of ​​a thousand infected transmitting the virus to two people each, as the extreme scenario ten \"super-contagiadores\" affecting fifty people each one (because their work puts them in contact with many people, because there was still no insulation, or for other reasons) and other ninety-nine that contaminates less than one person per capita. While the first scenario would ensure an exponential spread in the second control of the virus it would be much easier once one identifies the conditions that favor the massive transmission. Between these two extremes there is a whole world of possibilities we do not know, and that will determine when and how will the nCoV Latin America.\nActually, what these numbers tell us is that uncertainty is an unavoidable aspect when we speak of epidemics. The drama is in fact a way to reduce it: if we have a clearly identifiable enemy, fear becomes certainty. But this same bias is what makes us belittle or ignore those risks to which we have become accustomed. Even when they are suffering a worrying rise.\nLet's talk, for example, the mentioned measles. In 2016 there were fewer than a hundred cases in the Americas. Two years later the figure had increased one hundred sixty: 16,000, recorded by WHO, mostly located in Brazil. Sao Paulo in 2019 recorded the first death from the disease in two decades. The lack of coverage of full and effective vaccination was the main cause.\nMalaria infected by mosquitoes in tropical areas, is otherwise return an adversary who never left the whole. But here the weight of the upturn corresponds to Venezuela, which captured more than half of the total cases in 2017.\nInterestingly, although both diseases have disproportionately drawn attention in the respective countries during the last half of 2019, both in Brazil and Venezuela look (measured by Google searches) turned quickly to the coronavirus in early 2020, confirming that nothing beats a good, new story of fear and uncertainty.\nThus, although follow our attention different logics, while certain diseases are greatly diminished or almost disappeared in the region (cholera is a good example of success), others remain with similar figures (tuberculosis: about 280,000 cases throughout the American continent year after year throughout the XXI century), as referenced above, even recover lost ground. When looking for causes, no simple answers. The mosquito-borne diseases are a good example. Several Venezuelan doctors on the ground have complained about the lack of fumigations led by the state that once served to decimate malaria. But spraying is not everything: as asked in its editorial of March 2016 the Journal of the National Institute of Health of Colombia, of the Zika (another virus infected bites) in Colombia and Brazil, do you really how cash is fumigated in places that do not meet sanitation (water, garbage collection) minimum? The director of the Institute for Health and Environment at the University of El Bosque, Victor Olano, pointing at a later issue of the same publication the need to ensure these minimum coverage in rural areas as a first line of fire against another disease still present on the continent : yellow fever.\nA similar reflection we can make in your day with nCoV: although it is likely that all the media attention focuses on the design of new drugs, measures basic control proliferation (early identification of cases with corresponding insulation) and maintenance healthy immune systems are the most effective strategies, but less spectacular. Similarly, the best way to prevent such epidemics flourish is to implement hygiene protocols in the treatment of animals by humans, something that the public authorities also have much to say and do.\nThe war against epidemics is not ultimately a matter of a single dramatic battle for the fate of mankind. It is neither the nCoV, as it was not the H1N1 (which, although diminished, still with us).\nThe moral is that, as the disseminator Swedish doctor Hans Rosling said, we must tame our thirst for drama and refocusing attention, effort, dedication to what can actually have a positive impact. In the case of infectious diseases, vaccines, protocols and sanitation infrastructure, research and response mechanisms exist internationally are our best allies. While the first two points are what will help us fight diseases already known, research and supra-state capabilities are particularly crucial when we are facing a new disease. Recognizing this, the World Health Organization agreed international regulatory framework of reference in 2005 to ensure commitment to common standards in the region and throughout the world. Every year, the WHO itself measures the degree of implementation of regulations in each country.\nAlthough there are obvious differences in the region it is considerable agreement. There are some worrying points in regard to preparation, and some countries are conspicuously behind the rest. It is also important to note that these WHO figures do not measure the quality or the actual state of health systems in the field. Something that, for example, Venezuela would score well below the rest given the damage to its facilities with the crisis of recent years. All these data indicate that, on paper, the continent has many of the tools of governance needed to face a new epidemic. Now, to know what their exact translation into reality can only hope.",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "世界上有一种新的病毒，我们大家要问的问题是同样的：它何时会靠近我们？NCOV（新冠状动脉）是在距拉丁美洲数千公里的偏远地区诞生的：根据一项详细研究，没有一个大陆城市是从受影响的中国省份接受访问最多的城市。然而，谷歌搜索的“冠状动脉”在过去几天里已经开始了。\n在所有的情况下，警报器是为一些可疑的案件。媒体和观众正在追捕来自NCV的零拉丁美洲病人。我们已经有了一些抛弃物：一个在塔毛利帕斯边界，一个在卡利，另一个在阿根廷北部，一些在巴西，目前正在研究。这件案子很可能迟早会来的一切都进展得太快了当我读到这些台词时我们可能已经在报纸头条上看到了那到底是什么意思？进口鲜为人知的呼吸系统病毒对该区域意味着什么？\n如果我们的大脑能以戏剧性的方式来定义风险我们需要一个角色（疾病）和事件过程中的巨大变化（日常生活），以提高我们的警惕。但这种病很少有人会按照这个剧本来行事，霍利伍德斯，尽管我们很努力地把它放进故事里。例如，2009年4月在墨西哥出生的甲型（猪）流感流行病。从一个星期到另一个星期，全国（和全世界）的注意力集中在四个字符上：H1N1。一种紧急的感觉很快就被感染了，例如，通过电子脉冲，反映在相关的谷歌搜索中。但是，这一流行病本身的发展速度要快得多。\n否\n更重要的是，科学小组一步一步地对病毒的实际附加影响进行了评估，同时采取了必要的遏制和应对措施。最后，这是一种传染病，是的，对年轻人来说是一种令人吃惊的危险（当流感通常主要影响到65岁以上的人时）。但这并不是我们所想描述的死亡灾难：根据美国疾病控制中心的估计，H1N1导致了与季节性流感大致相同的人的死亡，并使其低于过去的其他大流行病。\n然而，我们的大脑仍然致力于寻找这样的戏剧性的数字显然是冰冷的。这些数字中有一个引起了社会网络中有关国家儿童委员会的观众的注意，即所谓的R0，即感染另一种疾病的人的平均人数。几位流行病学家提出估计时，我们才感染了几个星期。有些人抓住了最高的数字，再次敲响警钟，发出这样的信息：“每一个冠状动脉感染者将传染三人”。但事实是，这些估计有很大的差异。它们始终是：即使有众所周知的疾病，根据研究结果，R0值也会发生巨大变化。\n这几乎是不正常的：归根结底，一种疾病的行为方式可能因其发展的社会背景而大不相同。在一个没有卫生条件和人口密度高的地区爆发的病毒与在一个人口稀少的农村地区爆发的病毒不一样。这就是为什么即使是最具传染性的疾病，例如麻疹，也会产生非常广泛的感染范围。\n否此外，让我们不要忘记，平均值可能是误导性的：如果发现全国艾滋病疫苗公司在中国的感染率是2，那么这个数字与1000人感染的想法是一致的，将病毒传播给两个人。比如十个“超级传染者”的极端情况，每一个都影响到另外五十个人（因为他们的工作使他们接触到许多人，因为他们还没有被隔离，或者因为其他原因），还有另外九十九个人均感染不到一人。虽然第一种情况将确保指数性传染，但在第二种情况下，一旦查明有利于大规模传染的条件，控制病毒就会简单得多。在这两个极端之间，有一个我们不知道的可能性的世界，它将决定NCV何时和如何到达拉丁美洲。\n事实上，这些数字告诉我们的是，当我们谈论流行病时，不确定性是不可避免的。事实上，这场悲剧是减少这场悲剧的一个办法：如果我们有一个明确的敌人，恐惧就会变成肯定。但是，正是这种偏见使我们低估或无视我们已经习惯的风险。即使他们的病情令人担忧\n比如说，在2016年，美洲大陆的麻疹病例不到100例。两年后，这一数字增加了一百六十倍，约16000人，由卫生组织计算，其中大部分在巴西。2019年圣保罗记录了20年来第一次死于这种疾病缺乏全面和有效的疫苗接种是主要原因。\n疟疾在某些热带地区通过蚊子传染，是一个从未完全消失的对手返回的又一个例子。但在这方面，委内瑞拉的负担是最沉重的，该国在2017年占所有病例的一半以上。\n否\n有趣的是，虽然在2019年下半年这两种疾病在各自国家引起了不成比例的关注，但在巴西和委内瑞拉，目光（谷歌搜索量）在2020年初迅速转向冠状动脉，证实没有什么能超越好的，新的恐惧史不确定性。\n因此，尽管我们的注意力在逻辑上各不相同，尽管该区域某些疾病严重减少或几乎消失（霍乱是一个成功的好例子），但其他疾病（结核病：整个美洲大陆在整个21世纪中每年约有28万例病例）仍然存在类似的数字。就像上面提到的，他们甚至恢复了失去的土地。在寻找原因时，没有简单的答案。蚊子传播的疾病就是一个很好的例子。委内瑞拉的一些实地医生抱怨说，没有政府主导的喷洒，而这种喷洒曾经是用来消灭疟疾的。但是熏蒸并不是万能的：正如哥伦比亚国家卫生研究所的杂志2016年3月所问的，在哥伦比亚和巴西的Zika（另一种被叮咬的病毒）中，在不符合卫生条件的地方（水渠）熏蒸是如何有效的，垃圾收集，最低限度？森林大学健康与环境研究所所长维克托·奥拉诺在同一出版物的后面一本中指出，必须确保农村地区的最低限度覆盖率，以此作为对付非洲大陆上另一种疾病——黄热病——的第一道防线。\n否\n我们最终也可以同国家制药公司进行类似的思考：虽然所有媒体的注意力都可能集中在新药物的设计上，基本的扩散控制措施（及早发现与之隔绝的病例）和保持健康的免疫系统是最有效但不太引人注目的战略。同样，防止这种流行病蔓延的最好办法是由人类在动物治疗方面执行卫生议定书，这也是公共当局可以说和做的事情。\n防治流行病的战争最终不是为人类的命运而进行的一场戏剧性战斗的问题。与H1N1（虽有所减少，但仍在我们中间）不同的是，对于NCOV也不会如此。\n教训是，正如瑞典的传播医生汉斯·罗斯林所说的那样，我们必须驯服我们对戏剧的渴望，重新集中注意力、努力和专注于能够产生积极影响的事情。就传染病而言，疫苗、卫生规程和基础设施、研究和国际反应机制的存在是我们最好的伙伴。虽然前两个要点将有助于我们防治已知的疾病，但在我们面对一种新的疾病时，国家的研究和能力特别重要。认识到这一点，世界卫生组织于2005年商定了一个国际管理参考框架，以确保对该区域和全世界的共同标准作出承诺。卫生组织本身每年都在衡量各国执行这些条例的程度。\n虽然该区域有明显的差异，但一致性相当大\n否在准备方面有一些令人关切的问题，有些国家明显落后于其他国家。此外，必须强调，卫生组织的这些数字不能衡量实地保健系统的质量和实际状况。例如，考虑到委内瑞拉设施在过去几年的危机中受到的破坏，委内瑞拉的排名远远低于其他国家。这些数据只表明，非洲大陆在纸面上有许多治理工具，可以用来对付新的流行病。然而，我们只能等待，以便知道它将如何准确地变为现实。\n",

A margin of the intentions of the doctor, who would certainly be good, it seems the voice indicated to report on this outbreak.\n\"In this case, several things come together, because Cavadas has great prestige and authority in his field and among the public, but at times like this we must be very careful with what they say, especially if you're not an expert and no accounts direct information, \"says Carolina Moreno, professor at the University of Valencia and expert in scientific and medical misinformation. \"It's an opinion, but people do not take it as an opinion more because it is a highly respected physician, and does not help strengthen confidence in the authorities, so necessary in these cases,\" he adds. Disinformation is not all malicious or deliberate.\nThe coordinator of the initiative #SaludSinBulos, Carlos Mateos, believes that in situations like the present, with 19 Spaniards returning from the area affected by the virus, no speculation should be disseminated. \"And if you speculate missing, other persons or institutions with expertise in the subject, which is reference in the field. If anyone should doubt the opacity of China, which is the perfect seed for disinformation, who are experts, workers field or WHO itself, \"he says.\nMateos has identified numerous hoaxes that are circulating through all kinds of channels since the outbreak of the crisis in the media. Especially those related images difficult to locate, but high impact. \"We must be cautious, wary of someone who appears with mask, for example, which can be anywhere or any year. However, spread very easily and very fast,\" laments Mateos, vice president of the Association of Researchers in eHealth.\nEspecially hoaxes have circulated and misinformation with an origin outside Spain, encouraging all kinds of conspiracies about the cause, the motives and the \"hidden truth\" about the outbreak. But with the repatriation of Spanish from Wuhan they appear many more Spanish invoice, according Mateos, giving the appearance of closeness to the hospital or returned. For example, on the platform of fact-checking Maldita.es have disproved a canard that ran through mobile which ensures that the \"Ministry of Health\" (in Spain is the Ministry of Health) has issued a \"notice of emergency\" in which reports that \"the outbreak of coronavirus this time is very serious and deadly\". all false. In his last appearance, Fernando Simon said that \"the epidemic is likely to begin to subside soon.\"\nIn addition to the press conferences is giving Simon the Ministry of Health has agreed with the platform Twitter to refer to its official account when users view on this matter. To avoid confusion, experts ask you deal only voices authorized or official accounts of agencies involved. Otherwise, noise can cause confusion and distrust the management of the epidemic.\nTwo days ago, the country secured in its editorial that \"we must therefore keep a vigilant watch, but without falling into alarmism that may aggravate the inherent damage to an epidemic of this nature.\" In the same way, The New York Times warned in an editorial that distrust of science and institutions can be a serious problem if the worsening outbreak: \"Another major problem is the lack of public trust: the measures of control only work if people follow them. And it's much less likely that people follow orders when they do not trust the authorities. \" And he remembers again the case of ebola: \"Trust can be as important as technology and financial resources to keep at bay the outbreak of coronavirus, as they learned workers in global health during outbreaks recent Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \".\nJavier@esmateria.com can write to us or follow STUFF on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or subscribe to our newsletter here.",

Ninety-three people are in isolation wards in various hospitals, according to the latest figures.\nKey players in the field have claimed that mass cancellations of hotel bookings and tour packages have already begun across the state.\nAfter the Kerala government declared the coronavirus outbreak as a 'state calamity', as the three positive cases were detected from Thrissur, Alapuzha and Kasaragod, tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran admitted that the sector had suffered a hit.\nThe sector had aggressively launched promotional advertisements in the domestic and international markets after the floods to revive the sector\n.\nHowever, all the efforts took a beating, with mass cancellations of hotel bookings after the outbreak of the infection in the state was reported.\nAccording to tourism department sources, during the 2019 calendar year it was projected that there would be an 18 per cent growth in the domestic and 8 per cent growth in foreign tourist arrivals.\nIn the first nine months of 2019 (January to September), domestic visitors to the southern state touched 16.48 per cent against 4.8 per cent in foreign tourist arrivals.\nThe peak season for foreign tourists is from November-February while for the domestic guests it is during April-May, August-September (Onam festival) and December-January.\nNoted travel and tourism entrepreneur E M Najeeb said tour programmes and packages are being cancelled widely from the state.\nDeclaration of the epidemic as a 'state calamity' by the government would adversely impact the economic situation in the state, he said.\n\"We completely appreciate the steps taken by the government to protect the infected persons, create awareness among the public and tackle the situation.\n“But, as far as tourism industry is concerned, such measures will scare the people. Not only tourism but all the business activities of the state will be affected,\" Najeeb, also senior vice president, Indian Association of Tour Operators, told PTI.\nWhile Najeeb said \"over-reaction\" would not augur well for the state, Jose Dominic, a key player in the hospitality industry, felt there are cancellations of hotel bookings but not as much as was being projected by the media.\nDominic said he personally felt that the state's reputation of having a robust healthcare system would help in such situations.\n\"We cannot say that there is no cancellation of hotel bookings. There are 15-20 per cent cancellations after the reporting of the coronavirus cases. But there are bookings also,\" he told PTI\n.\nThough people were worried about the development, the state generally has a reputation that the safest place to be in India, especially during the time of a health calamity, is Kerala, he said.\n\"We have a reputation that we will put travellers' health first before commercial interest,\" Dominic, CEO of Kochi-based CGH Earth, added.\nMeanwhile, a senior official of the state tourism department said the exact number of cancellations were not yet available, but he agreed that the repeated instances of flood and other epidemics were affecting the industry.\n\"As of now, the exact numbers are not available. But industry sources told us that many hotel bookings, including that of KTDC (Kerala Tourism Development Corporation) have been cancelled,\" he told PTI.\nThe help desks of Kerala Tourism at various centres were receiving several enquiries from people wanting to know the situation in the state, he said.\n\"As of now, the situation in Kerala is under control. There is no need to worry. But still people are worried and some have cancelled their bookings,\" the official said.\nHowever, Praveen Muraleedharan, who runs a couple of resorts in the state, said uncertainty was looming over the industry due to the virus scare.\n\"We are getting lots of cancellations. Many confirmed hotel bookings, events, conferences have got cancelled. The industry is extremely worried about the business. There is an uncertainty looming over the industry. We don't know from when we can start taking bookings,\" he said.\nMuraleedharan said the industry was also affected by the hartals or strikes even as the government had claimed that the protests will not affect the tourism sector.\n\"Earlier, hartals used to affect our industry. Even now, the situation is not different. Sabarimala protests, two consecutive floods and landslides in Wayanad, Nipah, anti-CAA protests and now this coronavirus.\n“All are directly affecting the tourism industry\n. Inflow of inbound tourist and the domestic tourism movement are affected,\" he said.\nAccording to T K Manzoor, managing director of the Bekal Resorts Development Corporation, despite the floods and Nipha, they had recorded a remarkable increase in tourist arrivals.

We should not suspend but expand the economic and trade cooperation between the two countries,\" Sun Weidong said.\nIn the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province, India has put restrictions on the movement of people to and from China, like many other countries, as part of precautionary measures to contain spread of the virus.\nThe death toll in China because of the virus has gone up to 490 while the number of confirmed cases has touched 24,300.\nThe WHO has declared a global health emergency after coronavirus cases were reported in several parts of the globe.\n\"We hope that the Indian citizens will not overreact or panic over the outbreak. It is better to remain rational and calm, and judge China's prevention and control efforts with objectivity and compassion,\" Sun Weidong said.\nSun Weidong said that China, a \"responsible\" country, is not only protecting the health of its people but also that of people around the world.\n\"We need your understanding and support for the cooperation between China and India in epidemic control to ensure normal personnel exchanges and trade between the two countries,\" Sun Weidong said\n.\n\"China is ready to continue to work with India, strengthen communication and coordination, and safeguard the health and safety of Indian citizens in China,\" Sun Weidong added.\nOn the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on China's economy, Sun said there was no need to be pessimistic about the country's economy as its fundamentals remain unchanged.\nSun Weidong said the Chinese government has ample resources and policy tools to cope with economic volatility and the long-term \"positive trend\" of the Chinese economy will not be impacted by the outbreak of the virus.\n\"China has rich experience in successfully dealing with SARS and the international financial crisis. This time will be no exception. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva recently expressed confidence that the Chinese government has sufficient policy space to stabilize economic growth,\" Sun Weidong said.\nSun Weidong also mentioned a telephone conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Wi and his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar last week on ways to deal with the situation arising out of the outbreak of the virus.\n\"In the telephone conversation, Wang said that to address transnational public health challenges in this era of globalisation, we need to stay objective and rational, and step up communication and coordination, and that all should play a constructive role,\" Sun Weidong said.\nSun Weidong added that Jaishankar had conveyed that it is important to evaluate the outbreak in an objective and rational manner and not take actions that may complicate the situation.\nOn Saturday, 324 Indians were brought back from Wuhan, while another batch of 323 Indians and seven Maldivians were evacuated from the Chinese city on Sunday.\nSun Weidong said that a declaration of public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak in China is not a vote of no-confidence on China\n.\n\"When the director general of WHO declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, it emphasised that it does not recommend any travel or trade restriction. This declaration is not because of what is happening in China, but to take care of other countries with relatively poor sanitary conditions. It is not a vote of no confidence in China,\" Sun Weidong said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(Reuters) - The spread of a new coronavirus in mainland China and to 27 countries and regions beyond is alarming health experts. Here is what we know - and do not know - about the virus:\nThe coronavirus family of viruses includes the common cold and more serious diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\nMany of those with the new virus who have died had pre-existing medical conditions or were elderly, those with weakened immune systems.\nCoronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough and breathing difficulties.\nStatistics from China indicate that about 2% of people infected with the new virus have died, suggesting it may be deadlier than seasonal flu but less deadly than SARS, which killed about 10% of infected individuals. The MERS outbreak in 2012 had a fatality rate of about 35%.\nScientists have labeled the new virus 2019-nCoV.\nThe virus can be transmitted via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes, and can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles.\nExperts have said it is more easily transmitted than the SARS virus. The incubation period is up to 14 days. People may be able to infect others before symptoms appear.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people frequently wash hands, cover mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing, and avoid close contact with those who are sick.\n“We recommend the use of masks for people who have symptoms ... because the virus transmits through droplets,” says medical expert Sylvie Briand.\nBut they do not guarantee protection against infection.\n“For people who don’t have symptoms, the mask in fact is not useful,” Briand says.\nThe American Centers for Disease Control’s advice is that face masks are not required for the general public.\nThere is no vaccine\n.\nChinese scientists were able to identify the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus and shared it publicly. Scientists in Australia have developed a lab-grown version of the virus, a step toward creating a vaccine.\nDrugmakers around the globe expect to begin testing experimental vaccines on humans in about three months.\nAbout 99% of the more than 20,000 cases have been reported in mainland China. Nearly 230 cases have been reported in about 27 other countries and regions, a Reuters tally based on official statements shows.\nAt least 490 people have died in China, most in and around the city of Wuhan, where the virus emerged late last year. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines, both following visits to Wuhan.\nSingapore confirmed four more coronavirus cases on Feb. 5 taking its tally to 28. Thailand has 25 cases.\nIt took the new coronavirus 48 days to infect the first1,000 people. It took SARS 130 days to infect 1,000 people. It took MERS 2.5 years to infect 1,000 people.\nThe Chinese government has virtually locked down the central province of Hubei, home to 60 million people, and its capital Wuhan.\nChina is facing mounting isolation as airlines suspend flights to its cities.\nThe United States and Australia have banned entry to foreign nationals who have recently traveled to China.\nMany countries have evacuated their citizens from Hubei and are putting them in quarantine or isolation upon return.\nThe WHO has not recommended travel or trade curbs with China.\nIt is believed to have originated in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. Health experts think it may have originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via another species.\nGenetics of the new virus here\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) said it will take down misinformation about China’s fast-spreading coronavirus, in a rare departure from its usual approach to dubious health content that is presenting a fresh challenge for social media companies.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has stoked a wave of anti-China sentiment around the globe. Hoaxes have spread widely online, promoted by conspiracy theorists and exacerbated by a dearth of information from the cordoned-off zone around China’s central city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began.\nNearly 12,000 people have been infected in China, according to local health authorities, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions.\nFacebook said in a blog post that it would remove content about the virus “with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,” saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to “physical harm.”\nThe move is unusually aggressive for the world’s biggest social network, which generally limits the distribution of content containing health misinformation to its 2.9 billion monthly users through restrictions on search results and advertising, but allows the original posts to stay up.\nIt also puts it at odds with other major U.S.-based social networks. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) YouTube, which has 2 billion monthly users and Twitter (TWTR.N) and Reddit, which have hundreds of millions of users, confirmed they do not consider inaccurate information about health to be a violation of their policies.\nThose companies, like Facebook in other cases, rely on techniques such as elevating medical information from authoritative public health sources and warning users about content that has been debunked.\nTikTok, owned by China’s Bytedance, and Pinterest Inc (PINS\n.N) do ban health misinformation and are actively removing false coronavirus content, they told Reuters.\nFact-checking initiative PolitiFact said misinformation about the virus online included hoaxes about its source, its spread, and how to treat it, as well as false conspiracies about its connection to biological warfare and the Chinese government.\nRumors about the coronavirus have also spread widely on Chinese social networks, which are usually quick to remove sensitive content but have in recent days allowed an unusual level of public criticism over the government’s handling of the crisis.\nInformation in China is tightly controlled, and Chinese laws dictate that rumor-mongers can face years in prison. In the early days of the outbreak, Chinese state media reported that police in Wuhan had detained eight people for spreading rumors about a “local outbreak of unidentifiable pneumonia.”\nSuspicion also lingers over accusations that Beijing initially covered up the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.\nA spokeswoman for Tencent Holdings Inc’s (0700.HK) Chinese messaging app WeChat, which has 1.15 billion monthly users, told Reuters the company was removing posts containing coronavirus-related misinformation.\nThe U.S. tech industry’s mostly hands-off approach has angered critics who say social media companies have failed to curb the spread of medical inaccuracies that pose major global health threats.\nIn particular, misinformation about vaccination has proliferated on social media in many countries in recent years, including during major vaccination campaigns to prevent polio in Pakistan and to immunize against yellow fever in South America.\nFacebook, under fierce scrutiny worldwide in recent years over its privacy and content practices, has previously removed vaccine misinformation in Samoa, where a measles outbreak killed dozens late last year\n.\nThe spread of illness there was so severe that the company classified anti-vaccination content a risk of physical harm, a spokeswoman told Reuters, calling the move an “extreme action.”\nThe coronavirus and Samoa decisions indicate Facebook is expanding its definition of “physical harm” to include misinformation contributing to the rapid spread of illness.\nThe company did not say whether it had acted in a similar way in other cases.\nIt removed misinformation about polio vaccines in Pakistan, but the imminent harm in that case involved risks of violence against the health workers carrying out the immunization campaigns, the spokeswoman said.\n",

However, the property management company of the community then issued a notice to clearly announce that four confirmed cases of coronavirus pneumonia have been found in the community and are under isolation treatment.\nIn January 25th, the official media reported, \"(Tianjin) public security organs found in their work that Xi Moumou made false statements about the number of new coronavirus infecting pneumonia in WeChat's friends circle during the period from 11 to 14 January 24, 2020. At 19:00 on January 24, Xi was arrested by the peace branch of the Public Security Bureau. Xi has confessed to the above illegal facts and is now under administrative detention in accordance with the law. \" There is no detail about what he fabricated.\nWhy the authorities are so nervous? Yang qianrun, a counselor in the circle of friends, has a good understanding of the state of mind of the authorities: \"even if you know the truth, even if you say the truth, please don't go around in disorder. You're not helping, you're not reminding people to pay attention to protection. Your information scares the people, causes the collapse of the national government, and it's up to you to turn the tide \" It's a bit of a sermon from Nazi propaganda minister Goebbels.\nThe reporter dare to speak\nZhang Eurasian, a reporter from Hubei Daily, felt that Wuhan had caused such a great loss to the whole country and wrote a blog call for \"an immediate change of commander for Wuhan\". The most ridiculous Hubei Daily sent an apology to the Wuhan municipal Party committee, and even shamelessly sent a letter to the Wuhan authorities, apologizing for \"adding obstruction and chaos\" to the leaders.\nOn January 24, Zhang Eurasian, a reporter from Hubei Daily, tweeted that Wuhan's \"top leaders\" must \"make a decisive change\". \"Like many people, I used to think that temporary change is not familiar with leadership and is not conducive to work, but according to the increasingly serious and expanding situation, the current people on the stage do not have such leadership and command power,\" he said \"For the sake of Wuhan, I hope to change the commander immediately!!!\"\nThe post was blocked, and the Hubei Daily of the Communist Party of China responded quickly. On that day, it immediately sent a letter to Wuhan Municipal Committee and government to apologize and review\n。 \"This morning, Zhang Eurasian, an employee of our group, made a wrong speech on his personal micro blog, adding disorder to the current prevention and control work, and blocking leaders at all levels,\" said in the letter about the explanation and apology of the group's employees for their wrong speech on their personal micro blog I'm sorry.\nHubei Daily also requires that \"all employees' personal microblogs, wechat and other self-Media and friend circles shall not publish or forward bad information or information not reported or verified by the media, but can only spread positive energy to form a chorus of people of one mind.\"\nIn January 24th, when reporters asked for the same day as commander in chief, Ma Guoqiang, commander of the Wuhan municipal Party committee and Secretary of the municipal new type of pneumonia prevention and control headquarters, stressed that \"we should integrate ideas and actions with general secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions and the Central Committee's decision making arrangements\" to ensure that the fever patients are treated in a timely manner. It's funny.\nI've been a senior official in Hubei for a long time\nObservers at home and abroad have realized that such a serious situation in Wuhan is caused by China's institutional problems, not by the neglect of government by one city or several low-level officials. Why did Wuhan delay such a long time, officials or dare not report, eliminate the problem on the spot, fear to make things big, hope that big things become smaller and smaller, because in need of positive energy, listening to good words, or above ambiguous attitude, this matter, why Xi Jinping did not speak for forty days later, it is doubtful that the central level must not escape this crisis. As a result, on these two days, we should go all out to fight against pneumonia in Wuhan in the last few days. After that, officials should boldly point their finger at the local authorities in Wuhan, such as the people's daily and the global times.\nThe people's daily and the global times criticized Wuhan authorities for \"not timely and accurate information disclosure\", referring to their \"boldness\", which caused panic. However, \"boldness\" is behind fluke, ignorance of the laws of infectious disease prevention and control, and ignorance of their own and others' health risks. \" A decent voice.\nHu Xijin, editor in chief of the global times, also mentioned in summing up the panic wave of the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan that the supervision function of the news media has been weakened by some functional departments that have nothing to do with propaganda but are very strong at all levels and places. There are so many multimedia people in Wuhan, but they have not issued their own warnings outside the health system\n。 The official tolerance of various voices on the Internet is also too low. Eight people who gave warnings on the Internet in Wuhan were interviewed by the public security at that time, which suppressed the whole public opinion to further discuss the risk of the new virus and continue to give warnings.\nSome analysts believe that the official system is always the same. If something goes wrong, the official media are busy washing the land for the leaders, exonerating them, transferring the responsibility, and catching a scapegoat. Wait and see how long Hubei officials can be.\nWang Xiaodong, governor of Hubei Province, said on Sunday that \"after the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia, the Central Committee of the party and the whole nation were worried. We felt very sad, very guilty and very self reproach.\" Some netizens commented, \"what did you do early? Eight people were arrested and a city was harmed. I'm afraid you are afraid of losing your official position, so you said it's very sad.\".\n",

The CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered at least 4 speeches in a week, which instructed the PLA to give full support to local prevention and control. Some sources pointed out to apple that after the closure of Wuhan City, all traffic stops, doctors go to and from work, and materials are delivered by volunteer teams initiated by the people's government. However, they received a message on Tuesday night asking the teams to withdraw. They cooperated with the central government to monopolize the power of distributing civilian medical materials, the PLA's medical teams drawing sea, land and air from the 24th to enter the city, as well as President Xi's latest instructions, It is expected that Wuhan will face great changes this morning.\nAccording to the previous report, among the nearly 6000 elite doctors and nurses from all provinces, there are many veterans who have fought against SARS. Most of the rescue teams are set up by the local health committee. The increased medical care came from Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, Shanxi, Jilin, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Hebei, Fujian, Yunnan, Jiangxi, three military medical universities and the National Health Commission, the State Administration of traditional Chinese medicine, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangdong Administration of traditional Chinese medicine, Beijing Administration of traditional Chinese medicine There are 18 provincial medical teams, 3 military hospital medical teams and 4 TCM medical teams.\nIn terms of materials, 32 tons of drugs and masks arrived in Wuhan by special plane of SF express as early as the 24th, the report said. The Ministry of Finance approved an emergency allocation of 1 billion yuan of epidemic prevention and control subsidy in Hubei Province according to the deployment of the State Council on the 23rd. On July 27, the Ministry of Finance allocated another 500 million yuan to Hubei Province.\nThe report refers to Hankou hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Western Hospital of universal love hospital, seventh hospital of Wuhan, Ninth Hospital of Wuhan, Wuchang Hospital of Wuhan and five hospitals of Wuhan. All the outpatient departments are designated by the municipal government as the centralized reception hospital for fever outpatient. According to the official confirmed cases in Hubei Province, 444 cases were reported on the 22nd, 549 cases on the 24th, 1052 cases on the 26th, and 2714 cases on the 28th. With more than 3 tons of materials, the increased medical care plus the medical care in Wuhan itself, as well as the medical supplies, should be sufficient. Yes, all the front-line doctors and nurses of the above hospitals sent out a call for help to the people last week, that is, after the arrival of a large number of manpower and materials, reflecting that the front-line doctors and nurses did not get reinforcements in the first time\n。\nIn addition, a large number of non-governmental materials have been intercepted and suspected of being confiscated, and the announcement of the Ministry of Civil Affairs has also revealed a mystery, the Apple Daily said. Sources pointed out that some logistics companies deceived them to include a batch of materials collected from the private sector into their warehouses on the basis of providing free storage; other private volunteers bought medical materials from overseas spontaneously, but also were intercepted by the customs, saying that the state would levy them, send them to Wuhan if they wanted to donate, and return them without donation. The Civil Affairs Bureau also issued a notice on the 26th that the central government should monopolize the right of distribution of materials, forbid charitable organizations and voluntary service organizations from other places to enter Hubei Province, organize volunteers, and assign designated organizations to collect and follow the pneumonia prevention and control headquarters in Hubei Province, Wuhan city and other places.\nThe Apple Daily said that President Xi made many speeches and spoke frankly about \"listening to the party's command\". Yesterday, he asked the PLA to give full support to local authorities in the prevention and control of the epidemic. It is expected that Wuhan will usher in great changes this morning.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new crown epidemic is a crisis that Xi Jinping's abnormal system can anticipate.\nThe columnist of the echo commentary reporter analyzed the institutional factors of the epidemic crisis, and concluded that whether Wuhan pneumonia or the previous Hongkong's Anti China war is a crisis that Xi Jinping can expect. The new coronavirus has blocked China's economy, killing hundreds of people and infecting thousands of others, the article wrote. But his other consequence is the damage to the credibility of China's technocratic system. The operation of the CPC lacks transparency, but it can still be trusted and obeyed by the Chinese people because it is efficient. In the economic sphere, it makes Chinese people rich in a generation's time, and it shows this efficiency in all other fields such as public health. This efficiency is the foundation of political power. In the face of the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, the Chinese government has been delayed for seven weeks. The author of this article points out that the main reason for denying the epidemic is the anti anomaly system established by Xi Jinping since taking office. Since 2012, Xi Jinping has accelerated the transformation of China's political economy, focusing on consumption and high technology. In the political field, it used the anti-corruption movement to control the party in its own hands, set up a system of personal rights that did not exist after Mao Zedong, and even wrote Xi's thoughts into the constitution. He abolished the term of office of the supreme leader and completely changed Deng Xiaoping's performance promotion system since 1978. Nowadays, the most important standard of official promotion is obedience. The pneumonia crisis in Wuhan shows that, at least in Wuhan, obedient officials control everything. The article quotes the writer Xu Kaizhen's point of view in an interview with the New York Times that the pressure of the anti-corruption movement makes the leaders of the bureaucracy, including those at the top, at a loss and only care about their positions. They can't take action without knowing the opinions of their superiors. The article wrote that Xi Jinping himself also admitted in February 3rd that the new crown epidemic situation is a major test of the ability to govern the country. But the author of this article points out that the crisis can be expected, the new crown epidemic is only one, but not the last major accident. Another major accident was in Hong Kong. If Xi Jinping's regime had not been more and more autocratic, there would not be a campaign of resistance on such a scale for young people in Hongkong. At the beginning of Hong Kong's sovereignty return, people also hoped that Deng Xiaoping style system would gradually open up. Hong Kong is gradually moving towards democracy. People in Hong Kong can retain their most important freedom\n。 But the new Mao Zedong changed the judicial system of Hong Kong, which shows that instead of Beijing moving closer to Hong Kong, it is the opposite. Young people in Hong Kong have been adamantly and courageously rejecting this prospect for seven months. The author predicts that China is still moving towards other accidents.\nJapan in the forefront of Wuhan pneumonia crisis\nIn fact, many cities in different provinces, large and small, have begun to take various measures to block the cities themselves, but not to make too much publicity. According to the report, at least 80 million people are estimated to be under observation in isolation across China, but the authorities avoid disclosing information.\nThe Princess Diamond, a luxury cruise ship, was stranded in Japan after several new cases of coronavirus infection were found. A reporter from the Figaro newspaper in Tokyo introduced the isolated life of 3700 tourists on the cruise ship, and pointed out that Japan was already in the front line of the epidemic crisis from various perspectives. Japan is the country with the largest number of infections outside China, with 45 cases as of Thursday night; Japan may also be the country with the most economic impact. On the one hand, Japan's economy mainly relies on exports to China, while China's economy has been in crisis; on the other hand, the impact of the epidemic on Japan's domestic market has also emerged. Every year during the Spring Festival, Japanese stores and restaurants are crowded with Chinese tourists. According to a document issued by BNP Paribas, from the SARS epidemic in 2003 to 2019, the number of Chinese tourists to Japan increased 21 times, accounting for one third of the total number of Japanese foreign tourists. What's worse, Japan has been preparing for the Tokyo Olympics in July for many years, hoping that the Olympics will become an opportunity to show the world success and prosperity. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said whether the Tokyo Olympics will be rescheduled.\nCDC: new coronavirus is unlikely to spread in the EU\nThe Figaro newspaper also published an article on the work of the European Center for Disease Control and prevention, headquartered in Stockholm. The center has no laboratory. Its main function is to collect information, coordinate the epidemic prevention and control efforts of member countries, and observe the spread and research of 56 infectious diseases in the world. Julien beaut é, a virus expert at the center, told the paper that because the center continues to track and observe the spread of various infectious diseases, they have long found unknown pneumonia in China. Chinese officials have only since confirmed the news. But he also said that most of the infectious diseases they followed were known viruses, and that the medical community understood the incubation period and the infection period\n。 But they don't know whether the new coronavirus is just human to human transmission, and whether there are still active animal infectious sources in China? Which factors may lead to increased mortality, asymptomatic infection can infect others, and so on. Now the only thing that is certain is that the epidemic is still spreading. Although the academic community still lacks a complete understanding of this, the center believes that the epidemic is unlikely to spread in the EU.\n",

Now the men have recovered and discharged, which is the first time in Japan to confirm such patients.\n24, the Ministry of health and labour announced that more than 40 year old male infected with the new coronavirus from Wuhan, Hubei, China, had symptoms of pneumonia. This is the second confirmed new virus infection in Japan.\nAfter that, Japan's Ministry of health, labor and welfare successively published such examples.\nSecond: the Japanese infected with the new coronavirus pneumonia and the asymptomatic viral carriers of coronavirus infected by Japanese charter flights or government planes. A total of 9.\nSo far, the Japanese government has chartered civil aircraft three times and dispatched government chartered aircraft to pick up the Japanese in Wuhan. At present, there are 565 Japanese returning home.\nOf the first group of people returning home, 3 were infected with the virus. 1 of them were diagnosed as pneumonia with the new coronavirus infection, and the other 2 were asymptomatic pathogen carriers. Another person was negative at the first test and then positive again.\nAmong the second group of returnees, 2 were asymptomatic pathogen carriers. Another January 31st examination was negative, pneumonia appeared in February 1st, and 4 days later, it was confirmed that it had contracted the new coronavirus pneumonia.\nAmong the third group of returnees, one was infected with coronavirus pneumonia; one was an asymptomatic pathogen carrier, and the asymptomatic pathogen carrier fell ill on February 3.\nThe third category is the driver and guide who receive Chinese tourists, a total of three.\nA bus driver in Nara was infected with a new coronavirus pneumonia. He delivered 2 passengers from Wuhan to the group on 8~11 and 12~16 January.\nIn 9 days, the driver carries about 60 tourists from Wuhan\n。 The female guide who took the same bus was also diagnosed with infection. The guide is a more than 40 year old non Japanese woman living in Osaka city. She and the driver two once received a tour group from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. A more than 20 year old female tour guide living in Chiba County, who was infected with a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, was infected with the Dalian tourism team from 17 to 22, while the driver was infected with the new type of coronavirus pneumonia in Nara.\nWhy does Japan become the country with the largest number of infected people outside the mainland of China?\nFirst of all, Japan has recently become the most popular overseas tourist destination for Chinese tourists. In 2019, the number of foreign tourists to Japan exceeded 9.5 million for the first time, accounting for the first time in the world.\nAccording to \"where have more than 5 million people left Wuhan?\" published on January 26 on the first financial website of Chinese media? The chart of top 20 international transportation capacity of Wuhan Tianhe Airport quoted in big data tells you that from December 30 to January 22, 9080 people arrived at Narita Airport from the airport; 6272 people arrived at Kansai International Airport, 2656 arrived at Nagoya Central Airport, 18008 in total, accounting for the first number of passengers from the Airport to all countries in the world.\nAccording to the website of the people's Government of Hubei Province published in Hubei Daily on January 8, 2018, 19000 foreigners live in Hubei According to the survey results, among the foreigners who come to Hubei for employment and entrepreneurship, 57% are from Asia. The top 10 countries are Japan, South Korea, the United States, India, France, Canada, Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines and Italy. 81% of foreigners gather in Wuhan, and most in Yichang and Xiangyang. \"\nThese factors, at the time of the outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, make Japan the country with the largest number of infected persons outside the mainland of China.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Dracula's companion, bloodsucking night warmers, and now also dangerous virus seekers, who are to blame for the Coronavirus outbreak in China. The image of the bats has received another crack when genetic analysis of the new pathogen with the provisional name 2019-nCoV revealed: It is 88 percent related to a virus that treats under horseshoe noses (The Lancet: Lu et al. 2020). Bats, flying dogs and their relatives are particularly popular in Germany. Many people have been campaigning for decades for the protection of the 25-species native to us, almost a third of which are considered endangered or threatened with extinction.\nIt is not until the current coronavirus epidemic that bats are held accountable when an animal-borne pathogen spreads among humans. Fleas are considered to be a popular reservoir for viruses, i.e. the viruses are dormant in them and waiting for their chance to spread across species boundaries. When the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) also caused the first outbreak of the Coronavirus (Mers-CoV) in the year 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula, it was dromedars that transmitted the new pathogen to humans. But bats must have infected the camels.\nThe Nipah virus, which affected pig farmers for the first time in Malaysia, can also be traced back to bats: the farmers were infected by their pigs, who had eaten fruit again, on which feces and urine were glued by flying dogs. It is precisely this interplay of different species as hosts of viruses that divides scientists into at least two camps: some stress that the viruses originated from bats. The others focus on the fact that it was camels and pigs that transmitted the diseases to humans.\nYeah. Ultimately, the causal question remains one of the interpretations: is the type of causator of an epidemic that originally harbored the virus? Or the one who passed it on to humans?\nMost viruses have hosts beyond species boundaries. They are constantly changing, exchanging heritage among themselves and learning new things: Thus, a pathogen that first only affects birds can, through mutations, acquire the ability to enter human cells, so an animal disease becomes a disease for humans. When that happens, scientists talk about zoonosis. The further mankind enters the habitat of animals, the higher the likelihood that new zoonoses will emerge. People blush forests, hunt and eat wild animals or seek adventure in the wilderness as tourists. Rather, they come into contact with infected animals and stick to them. Similarly, in a wildlife market in Wuhan, the epidemic with the new Coronavirus may have begun.\nWhen the inheritance of the new pathogen was sequenced a few weeks after the outbreak, it turned out to be 88 percent equal to the two Coronavirus species found for the first time in bats. It is clear that this pathogen originated from the bat,\"says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit, a virologist at the Bernhard Nocht Institute of Tropical Medicine.\n\"I don't want to deny that the virus could have come from a bat at any time,\" says renowned bat researcher Paul Racey of Aberdeen University in Scotland.\nYeah. But he is a representative of the second group of researchers, who seems to be much more relevant to a completely different question: What kind of animal has the new virus ultimately transmitted to humans?\nBats are an order of mammals that, in the classical nomenclature, divide into the subordinates of flying dogs (Megachiroptera) and bats (Microchiroptera).\nRecent genetic analyses have shown, however, that the hoof-nosed species originally attributed to bats are more closely related to flying dogs. This is why zoologists nowadays distinguish bats from a new subsection, the yinterochiroptera: in turn, they include flying dogs and horseshoe-nosed (Rhinolophoidea).\nBats are usually nocturnal and can be spatially oriented by ultrasound. Most bats are smaller than flying dogs and feed mostly on insects. Flying dogs are called that because their head looks like a dog's. They are found mainly in the tropics and subtropes, where they feed mainly on fruit or nectar. In contrast to bats, flying dogs tend to orient themselves optically rather than over echo waves. Huffin-like species owe their name to a small patch of skin between the upper lip and the forehead, which is shaped like a Hufeisen. They feed, like bats, mainly on insects.\nBats are suspected to be the natural host of various viruses that can also make people sick: Ebola, Nipah, Hendra and Marburg as well as the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). In addition, researchers found similarities between the new Coronavirus 2019-nCoV and two virus strains found in bats.\nYeah.\nFor Racey, there would be clear evidence that the pathogen has passed directly from a bat or a flying dog to humans only if researchers could prove to a bat that it eliminates 2019-nCoV directly, so it actually spreads the virus. There is no such proof so far. The fact that two strands of viruses are similar in their heritage is not enough for bat researchers to blame the bats with their more than 1.400-known species alone for a new outbreak. After the rodents, they formed the most species-rich order of mammals, and were often targeted because of their large spread.\nAccording to Racey, it may be good that the new Coronavirus has long since passed from one bat to another. This intermediary could then have passed the agent on to humans, for example at the wildlife and fish market in Wuhan. What kind of animal this could be is still unclear.\" We don't know which animals were on the market,\"Racey says. Also Virologist Schmidt-Chanasit does not rule out that there was an intermediate host, i.e. animal species between bats and humans. But it is clear to him: the bat is the origin of the new Coronavirus. And whoever is the unknown landlord is being researched intensively.\nBut that is precisely what zoologists criticise: that all zoonoses are always researched until the bat appears at the origin of the infection chain. This is because not all potential species carrying viruses would be investigated equally intensively, says Merlin Tuttle, bat shooters and zoologists from the USA. Bats are easy to catch, Tuttle knows from his own experience: you set a trap at the entrance of a cave and wait, until the animals fly in.\" It would be much harder to catch thirty cobras than thirty bats,\"says the researcher\nYeah. The virologist Schmidt-Chanasit understands the argument, but says that you can argue the whole thing in the other direction: \"If you catch more bats, you might find a virus that matches the new Coronavirus to 99 percent.\"\nWhether Nipah, Sars or Mers: Bats are considered to be the original hearth for many viruses that can infect humans (trends in microbiology: Brook & Dobson, 2015). Often they carry the pathogens in the body without getting sick themselves. Why this is so, there are different theories about it: many have something to do with bats consuming extremely much energy while flying, which could also affect their immune system. It could, for example, result in their bodyguards not fighting viruses with full force but tolerating them by various means. This would also explain why the animals themselves do not get sick but can pass on the pathogens (Emerging Infectious Diseases: O'Shea et al., 2014). However, the exact mechanism has not yet been clarified.\nIt is at least clear that bats and flying dogs are \"an incredibly rich group of mammals\", says Fabian Leendertz, who is researching pathogenic microorganisms at the Robert Koch Institute of Epidemiology. And the more species there are, the higher the likelihood that the animals will host a greater variety of microbes. There are also very large bat populations that are a perfect reservoir for viruses. Individual species of flying dogs or bats do not necessarily have to be more mature than other animals. However, their diversity may make them frequent carriers. Researchers from the EcoHealth Alliance, a private research facility in New York, investigated 754 mammalian species and found that, overall, bats harbour more zoonotic viruses than any other mammalian species investigated (Nature: Olival et al., 2017)\nYeah.\nInter-owner or co-owner: the spread of the viruses is not the fault of the bat anyway. For nature does not know the principle of guilt. Seeing them as the cause may be right on the principle of causality, but it is too short-sighted. Voigt says, instead of pointing the finger at animals at any new pathogen emerging among humans, people should rather rethink their own behaviour towards wild animals. Wildlife plays a major role in transmitting viruses from animals to humans. Many zoonotic outbreaks, however, are not even due to people hunting large wild animals like monkeys in the jungle, Leendertz says. Instead, they are targeting so-called cultural successors, for example rats, bats and flying dogs that are in the vicinity of human habitations. At the same time, it is difficult to condemn such hunting practices on a global scale: hunting is an ancient tradition in many regions and is regarded as an important source of food. One problem is also the markets where people buy and sell wild animals. There, dead and living animals are offered in the narrowest space, people rush through the small alleys, everything mixes and mixes: a perfect place for a virus to spread quickly.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory\nYeah. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection.\nYeah. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nFledermaus researchers such as Racey and Tuttle fear that branding the flying dogs and bats as viral vectors will further worsen the relationship between them and humans.\" If bats are considered to be the cause of Ebola and other viruses, no one will accept a bat in their own garden anymore,\"says Tuttle. Recently he was called by the owner of an apartment complex: a bat flew into one of the apartments, the inhabitants are now afraid to have infected the animal with a disease.\" The current media reports on the connection between the Coronavirus and bats have certainly fuelled the story,\"Tuttle says\nYeah. Although Hufeisennasen may have played a role in the case of the new Coronavirus: here in Europe it is very unlikely that people will infect bats with a dangerous virus, says Christian Voigt, who is researching bats at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research. In Europe, bats could only transmit rabies. But this risk is also rather small: according to the Robert Koch Institute, the last rabies-related rabies-related case in Europe 2002 occurred in Scotland.\nThroughout the discussion about animals as vectors of disease, it is often forgotten how important they are to agriculture and nature worldwide, and what role they play in different ecosystems worldwide. Some flying dogs, but also few bats, pollinate just like bees and other useful crops. As insect eaters, our native bat species keep the pests in check. But not a few are now threatened with extinction. In this situation, the batsmen from the USA and Europe fear that an image of virus-spreading could further harm the animals: not only because then perhaps fewer people will donate for the protection of these animals than for sweet pandas or seal babies. It is also because they fear that bats could be systematically fought like rats or pigeons in the city. With all the excitement surrounding the origin of the new Coronavirus, the world should not lose sight of the global dramatic species death.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The Coronavirus spreads again more rapidly after the increase of new diseases had decreased slightly two days in a row. Throughout China, 34.546 infections have been confirmed. According to the National Health Commission, this is 3.399 more than a day before. The number of deaths increased by 86 to 722.\n24.953 confirmed infections with the pathogen 2019-nCoV and 81 new fatalities are now reported from the central Chinese province of Hubei, where the virus originally broke out in the Wuhan metropolis.\nIn China, the first foreign casualties have also been confirmed. As the US Embassy in Beijing reported on Saturday, a 60-year-old US citizen infected with the virus arrived in Wuhan on the 6th. February for life. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. According to this, it was a man in his sixties who was suspected of being infected with the virus. The patient suffered from severe pneumonia.\nChinese state television reports that a second new hospital has been opened for coronary cases. The first doctors\nand nursing teams have already arrived, on Saturday the first\nPatients are admitted to the 1.500-bed clinic. I\nOn Monday, a new hospital was opened for the isolation of coronary patients. The construction of the 60.000 square meter large building with 30 intensive care stations had eight days.\nIt was built by 7.000 specialists from containers.\nOutside mainland China, there are more than two dozen cases over 270, of which 14 in Germany. Another case of infection, the 12th, has been detected in Bavaria. The Bavarian Ministry of Health informs us. This is the wife of a man who works for the car supplier Webasto and was tested positive for the virus last week\nYeah. The patient is now being medically monitored like her husband and treated in isolation in a Munich clinic, it was said. Further details were not provided by the Ministry.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. Am 21\nYeah. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite.\nYeah. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nIn France, according to the government, five British citizens have been diagnosed with coronary infection. They would have stayed in the same accommodation in the French Alps as another Brit who had arrived from Singapore and had been diagnosed shortly before, says Minister of Health Agnes Buzyn. Among the newly infected, there was also a child. The group had been admitted to a hospital in the region in good health.\nIn the meantime, the Federal Government is having other Germans and their relatives brought back from Wuhan. About twenty people are expected at Tegel Airport on Sunday, the Berlin Senate Health Administration announced. After their arrival, it was planned to accommodate the Germans cautiously for 14 days in isolation on the premises of the DRK clinics in Berlin-Copenhagen. The city was well prepared, said Health Senator Dilek Kalayci. An official physician will receive the people in the military part of Tegel Airport, after which they will be tested for the virus. Results are expected on Monday afternoon.\nBecause of the new lung disease, the German army had already brought back Germans and their relatives from the town of Wuhan, which was heavily affected by the Coronavirus, in early February. Around 120 passengers of the flight have been quarantined since their return to a barracks in the Palatinate Germersheim. Two passengers had detected the virus.\nIn Hong Kong, however, the quarantine measures began: since Friday, all mainland Chinese immigrants have been carefully quarantined. 161 People have been affected so far, almost all are Hong Kong people, said Prime Minister Carrie Lam\nYeah. 148 People would have to remain quarantined in their homes and apartments, eleven would be in hotels and two in extra camps. There will be controls and anyone who violates the quarantine order will have to expect a prison sentence of up to six months and a fine.\nMeanwhile, Chinese scientists suspect that the new virus could also be transmitted via faeces. Some patients in a hospital in Wuhan would have had diarrhoea and nausea before the onset of fever symptoms and difficulty breathing, according to a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The main route of transmission of the virus continues to be a drop infection via the cough of a patient.\nIn ten percent of 138 patients, the disease course started with diarrhoea and nausea, researchers write. They indicated that in the early cases of the first disease in Wuhan in December they focused mainly on respiratory symptoms. Symptoms associated with the digestive tract may have been overlooked.\nKnowledge of an infectious pathway through faeces is not entirely surprising to science, as the Sars virus also partially transmitted during the epidemic in the early 2000s. Sars is caused by coronary viruses as well as the novel disease.\nRead all about the new Coronavirus on our topic page.\n",

The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals\nYeah.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nAlthough the declaration of a health emergency is not a miracle weapon, medical lawyers write in an article published today (Jama: Phelan et al., 2020). It was a \"strong signal to the international community\". The WHO Director-General and many experts hope that countries with weaker health systems will also benefit if the corona virus arrives.\nIn addition, the emergency room is also an operation\nto the sovereignty of a state and thus always a policy. In the case of\nCoronavirus 2019-nCoV in China is even highly political. China has tried to make the world\nmassive containment measures to show that it is in control of the emergency\nMaike Voss said: \"Health protection is always a sign\nChina wanted to show the world that there was no\nNeed help.

On the other hand, the\nEmergency, some say, the important cooperation with the Chinese government\nto put at risk the data and laboratory samples with the\nWHO and other countries.

But the onset of the virus comes at a time when many people are cold in this country, and the symptoms of both diseases are similar. So when is a cough just a cough and when is a case for the house doctor or even the hospital? Philipp Leson of the German Society of General Medicine and Family Medicine (Degam) explains who is the right contact person in case of a suspicion and what happens if a patient or a patient actually finds the new virus.\nONLINE TIME: Cough, fever,\nThe first symptoms of the Coronavirus 2019-nCoV are respiratory problems.\nCold season not unusual.

That hasn't changed a bit. This is not the case, however.\nif you really have a reasonable suspicion. For example, because you just\nfrom the region around Wuhan in China have come to Germany and now this\nIf you notice any symptoms or have had contact with someone who\nhas been shown to be infected with this disease.\nTIME ONLINE: If I now\ncall the house doctor and say, this is what my complaints look like--\nautomatically asked if I had contact to China?\nLeson: This depends on the type\nand the way you put it. If you just take these symptoms\ncall in practice and ask for an appointment, the medical\nProfessionals on the phone probably don't ask for it\nYeah. Often missing yes\nalso the time to get into a real history conversation there. But\nif you call with the concrete hint \"I was in China and have now\nthe following symptoms\", then it may be good that this is discussed in more detail.\nONLINE TIME: Are there any guidelines\nfor general practitioners, how should they behave in such cases?\nLeson: No, a concrete\nThere is no guideline. There are of course those of the German\nSociety for General Medicine and Family Medicine\nGuidelines on different counselling and treatment facilities\nExample of coughing. There are also specific procedures. However, Degam is currently recommending that each patient with a fever should be informed of the countries in which he and his contact persons last stayed.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003 about 8.000 people died, more than 750.\nYeah. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death.

Is that a risk?\nfor other patients already in the waiting room?\nLeson: A risk to\nThere are always sick people in the waiting room of a doctor's office. Because there\nPatients who may be infectious can sit where they can get infected.\ncan. This applies to this virus just as it does to everyone else. Here, too, it is a question of asking how much I, as a patient, appreciate the danger,\nA doctor or an assistant can't know that. So, when I\nI know I was in China and I'll come back with these symptoms, then I should\nat the reception. But, yes, you can basically\nInfect a disease that a patient has, possibly in practice.\nONLINE TIME: In\nPaediatric practice is sometimes seen as a separate waiting room for children\nExample of wind spots or masts.

You have to be\nListen in and say, \"If I have a 39-fever now, I'd better stay home.\"\nTIME ONLINE: Should I not shake hands right now?\nLeson: Of course, pathogens can be transmitted when shaking hands. This applies not only now, but at all times. Here too, the principles of reasonable suspicion and self-sufficiency are basically once again valid. In addition, anyone can minimise the risks of infection, for example by thoroughly washing their hands.\nONLINE TIME: And should one go to the doctor at the moment in view of the new Coronavirus\nhas such symptoms?\nLeson: You just have to understand the risk constellations:\nIs there really a reasonable suspicion that I have this virus in me\nShoot?

The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nIn the United States, another person is also infected with the virus, which can lead to severe pneumonia. A woman from Chicago was taken to a hospital according to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The woman had reported to her doctor a few days after her return from a Chinese trip with complaints. A case in Seattle had previously been confirmed in the United States.\nThe new virus called 2019-nCoV was first discovered in December 2019 on a closed fish and poultry market in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The Coronavirus causes respiratory disease, which can lead to pneumonia. According to previous knowledge, the virus can also be transmitted from human to human.\nFearing a further spread of the virus, this Saturday, millions of Chinese are on their way to China's New Year's Eve, the Chinese government has ordered national measures for trains, planes and buses. As the national health authority indicated, measuring stations are being set up throughout public transport. Passengers suspected of being infected should be taken \"immediately\" to a medical facility.\nBefore that, entire cities had been isolated. The cities of Wuhan, Huanggang, Xiantao and Ezhou as well as the smaller Chibi and now also the cities of Xianning, Xiaogan, Enshi and Zhijiang are practically cut off from the outside world. Public transport was suspended\nYeah. Overall, thirteen Chinese cities are now effectively under quarantine, with more than 41 million inhabitants affected. The southern city of Haikou has ordered that all travellers from Hubei will be isolated in a hotel for fourteen days and examined medically.\nIn China, 41 people have died as a result of the disease. According to their own data, the Chinese health authorities have registered infected 1.287 and would investigate several thousand suspected cases. According to calculations by experts from Imperial College London, however, the number of infections is likely to be much higher; they are based on 4.000 infected people.\nOutside China, cases were also confirmed in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. A first case was also reported from Nepal on Friday. All those involved had been to Wuhan before.\nThe president of the Robert Koch Institute relativized the global threat of the new Coronavirus.\" Outside China so far there are no large chain infections,\"Lothar Wieler said in today's ZDF Journal on Friday evening. However, the microbiologist stressed that the severity of the disease caused by the virus could not yet be accurately assessed.\" We do not have complete information,\"said Wieler.\nFederal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) urged to be prudent.\" We take this very seriously, we are vigilant, but also with a cool head at the same time,\"said the CDU politician in the ARD day topics. You are in daily exchange with experts. I also think it is important that we sort this out in such a way that we can then also take the necessary rest.\"\nThe Foreign Office invites Chinese travellers to read the Ministry of Health's safety instructions carefully before starting their trip. It recommends, among other things, that journeys to the areas affected by the Coronavirus be postponed as far as possible.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — Like many others on the frontline during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic in 2003, the resources of a family clinic in Chua Chu Kang had been stretched thin. \n Personal protective equipment — N95 respirators, sterile gloves and full-body gowns — was scarce at a time when the world had never seen a virus like it, and people everywhere were desperately scrambling to stockpile emergency supplies for themselves.  \n Speaking to TODAY, Dr Tan Tze Lee, a general practitioner at the Edinburgh Clinic, recalled the difficulties that frontline healthcare workers faced when procuring equipment to protect themselves from the killer virus.  \n By the time Sars was contained in May 2003, it had infected 238 people and killed 33 in Singapore. Two in five of those infected had been healthcare workers. \n While Dr Tan’s clinic thankfully encountered no cases, it remained on high alert for Sars patients in the four months of the epidemic in Singapore, throughout which the medical staff had to don full protective gear. But everyone was not ready for the crisis, said Dr Tan, who is also president of the College of Family Physicians Singapore.  \n Many continued to work but were extremely concerned that they might bring the virus home and put their loved ones at risk, he added.  \n “The healthcare practitioners in Singapore were ill-prepared, which resulted in sombre outcomes. Since then, we have learnt our lesson and measures were instituted to prepare us for any future pandemic event.” \n “Here we are today, ready to fight the 2019-nCoV,” he said. \n The current outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus — or 2019-nCoV, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) temporary name for the virus — was first confirmed in Singapore on Jan 23. To date, all cases were imported, including a Singaporean who was in Wuhan, and there has been no evidence of community spread in the Republic\n.  \n The WHO has yet to declare the virus — which has spread to several countries — as a pandemic. Nevertheless, it was declared a global health emergency on Friday (Jan 31).  \n The first cases were reported in Wuhan in China’s Hubei province and believed to be linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sells live animals.  \n As of noon on Friday, there were 16 confirmed cases with the virus here, 35 cases were still waiting for their test results and 198 had already tested negative. There are no deaths in Singapore thus far. \n At the heart of the city-state’s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after Sars and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (or H1N1) pandemic in 2009.  \n  Medical workers conduct routine checks to guests before the start of an NKF show at a Mediacorp studio as a safety precaution against SARS in 2003. TODAY file photo \n “After Sars, we made a thorough review of the facilities we had – the infrastructure, hospitals, isolation wards, and the scientific testing and capabilities,” said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.  \n “I think we are much better prepared now.”  \n Currently, Singapore is at Dors condition (Dorscon) Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is Dorscon Orange, which would have applied in the case of Sars, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. \n While the plans are in place and some measures have kicked in, Singapore’s national strategy is still largely untested — since the Wuhan coronavirus is believed to be in its early stages in the Republic, medical experts and Sars veterans told TODAY\n.  \n However, there are ample signs that the lessons from Sars are being applied as Singapore shores up its defences, they said. They believe that unlike during Sars, Singapore is far more ready now. \n LESSONS LEARNT \n Singapore has had two brushes with pandemics in recent memory — Sars and H1N1. \n While Singapore was able to contain and recover from both, the varying nature of the viruses, as well as the changes in medical science, meant that dealing with each required different approaches. \n Doctors had limited options when treating Sars patients and could only administer supportive care, and there was nothing that could be done to prevent infection. In comparison, vaccines and treatment options were available when H1N1 claimed 18 lives in Singapore and infected more than 400,000 people, out of which about 1,300 had to be hospitalised. \n Sars first arrived in Singapore in late February 2003, and was detected in a woman with an atypical pneumonia on March 1, 2003 at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). At the time, no one knew how deadly and virulent it was and the first patient led to a cluster of 42 cases at the hospital.  \n A Ministry of Health (MOH) taskforce was set up on March 15, two weeks after the mysterious strain appeared in Singapore and three days after the WHO issued a global alert on the outbreak that began in Hong Kong. \n But the command and control structure then was “wholly inadequate” in a crisis situation that was both fluid and unprecedented, a study in the Austrian Journal of South-east Asian Studies concluded in 2012. \n  Church goers being screened for their body temperature by the thermal imaging system at New Creation Church before attending prayers in 2003. TODAY file photo \n   Authorities conducting temperature screening at Tuas checkpoint on Jan 24, 2020\n. Photos: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n The structure was led by the health authorities, when in hindsight, it required “more than a medical approach since resources had to be drawn from a number of government agencies that did not fall under the rubric of the MOH”, said authors Allen Lai and Tan Teck Boon, who were from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. \n They noted that it took five weeks after the first case was reported for the bureaucracy to adapt, though by then, the outbreak had already spread quickly out of TTSH.  \n On April 7, 2003, a national control structure was created in response to Sars, comprising a nine-member inter-ministerial committee led by then Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng to provide strategic and political directions during health crises. \n Helping to coordinate across silos were a core executive group of senior civil servants, and an operations committee spanning ministries. Their functions were later consolidated during the H1N1 crisis, which meant that this leaner bureaucracy was quicker to respond to emerging situations on the ground. \n With the Wuhan coronavirus, observers told TODAY that it was evident that the Government had reacted more quickly than in Sars and H1N1 when it came to establishing a multi-disciplinary decision-making body.  \n Professor Ooi Eng Eong, an infectious diseases expert and virologist at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, noted that a multi-ministry taskforce on the Wuhan coronavirus was formed on Jan 22, several hours before the first suspected case came to the attention of the authorities at 10pm the same day. The patient — a 66-year-old Chinese national tourist from Wuhan — tested positive the next day, becoming the first confirmed case in Singapore\n. \n “If you look at the response time, it is a fact that the ministerial committee formed before the case appeared, and we can see that a lot of systems are already in place, occurring across ministries and not as siloed as back then when Sars caught us all by surprise,” said Prof Ooi, who is also deputy director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. \n The taskforce was formed to direct the whole-of-government response to the outbreak, coordinate the public’s response and work with the international community. \n Jointly chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, the taskforce comprises a cross-section of Cabinet ministers spanning various portfolios. They are: \n Adviser: Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat \n Mr S Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information \n Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry \n Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources \n Mr Ng Chee Meng, Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress \n Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education \n Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Home Affairs \n Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development \n Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Transport, Communications and Information \n Dr Chia Shi-Lu, a Tanjong Pagar GRC Member of Parliament who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that this time, the chain of command is clearer. \n He noted that even before the taskforce was formed, the MOH had already begun tracking the outbreak in China at the start of the year. Temperature screening measures were put in place at Changi Airport from as early as Jan 3. \n But the high political signature of the panel had led some to question whether too many cooks were spoiling the broth, Dr Chia noted. “In fact, some have asked me: Are we overdoing it?” he said\n.  \n “I believe it is very important for everybody to come into the picture — you have to, because at this early stage, (the outbreak) affects so many different parts and you need leadership from them, and you cannot rely solely on MOH to coordinate everything,” he added. \n While information about the Wuhan virus is still emerging, Singapore is not in the same position as in the initial stages of the Sars outbreak in 2003, where it was — in the words of then Health Minister Lim Hng Kiang —“flying blind”.  \n During the Sars crisis, Singapore only had two means to detect those infected with the virus: Their clinical symptoms and their travel history. Detecting these were not easy at the time as temperature screeners were also a rare resource, unlike today. \n “We have to depend on people taking temperature, and we have to depend on people being truthful to us in their contact history,” said Mr Lim then, describing Sars as a tremendous challenge. \n Dr Tan Yia Swam, First Vice-President of the Singapore Medical Association (SMA), said that in the Sars crisis, “there were too many unknowns, and precautions came too late, and too slowly”. Sars was zoonotic in nature, with the disease starting in animals before spreading to humans.  \n As a result, policies and procedures regarding risk stratification, contact mapping, contact tracing, quarantine and others were developed on the fly as the epidemic erupted, she said. \n “Today, all of the above have been developed and tested before in exercises and they are now put into action. Of course, these plans, policies and procedures must be modified in line with the epidemiology of the disease, but we are not working from scratch, unlike the past experience with Sars,” she added.  \n  Tan Tock Seng Hospital's moderate risk area during the 2003 Sars period. TODAY file photo \n   Notices at Tan Tock Seng Hospital informing visitors and patients of the Wuhan coronavirus\n. Photos: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n Addressing the media on Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong said that in the taskforce’s national response to the virus, it is able to “marshal all available resources” to tackle the scourge. \n In terms of capacity, Singapore has already beefed up its healthcare and isolation capacity since 2003. This includes the 330-bed National Centre for Infectious Diseases that opened last year, and new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in 2010, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital in 2015, and Sengkang General Hospital in 2018, he said. \n During Sars, TTSH was known as “Sars Central”, the designated hospital to handle patients. This was borne out of a policy to restrict transmission of the virus to other hospitals, after a patient — who was unaware that he had been infected with the virus during his stay in TTSH — created a new viral cluster at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) when he went there for a surgical problem after his discharge from TTSH.  \n This policy changed in 2009 during the H1N1 outbreak, with the Health Ministry imposing a standardised infection control measure on all healthcare facilities, empowered by timely tweaks to the Infectious Diseases Act. More than 400 family clinics were made “H1N1-ready” and equipped with the Tamiflu vaccine to handle the outbreak. \n Similarly, all public hospitals are capable of handling the Wuhan virus today, and come equipped with isolation rooms, which were in short supply in 2003.  \n When it came to medical supplies, Dr Chia recalled how there was hardly a stockpile of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers then, such as N95 respirators. \n “Because an N95 mask needs to fit well for it to perform its function, having a properly fitted mask was (hard to come by) during Sars, and we had to find time to do the fitting too,” said Dr Chia, who was an orthopaedic surgeon at SGH at the height of the crisis.  \n “Today, most of us are already fitted with our own personal equipment, even as new staff\n. Everything is in place today,” he said. \n Visitors, staff and patients entering Gleneagles Hospital will have to undergo a screening at the entrance. Photo: Justin Ong/TODAY \n For the general public, the Government will be disbursing a pack of four surgical masks to each of the 1.37 million Singapore households in a one-off exercise between Feb 1 and Feb 9. This was also done in 2003 when all households received a free emergency kit, containing N95 masks and themometers. \n This time round, the mask distribution comes amid long queues at pharmacies around the island as people clamour to buy masks, and retailers say their stocks of surgical masks and N95 masks are running low or sold out. The Government had released 5 million masks from its stockpile over nine days to the retailers but they were all snapped up in hours.  \n Said Dr Chia: “The message is that there is enough for the whole of the population and in reserve too.” \n SMA’s Dr Tan said his association met with the College of Family Physicians Singapore over the Chinese New Year weekend to carry out “complex logistics arrangements” to ensure that there is a steady supply of surgical and N95 masks to replenish stocks for the frontline healthcare workers. \n “We are all monitoring the situation closely, and are ready to step up efforts when the need arises,” he said. \n Experts noted that contingency plans have been put in place too — student hostels are converted into quarantine facilities in anticipation of future cases, and the Outward Bound Singapore on Pulau Ubin has been marked as a possible quarantine site. \n  Nanyang Technological University's Graduate Hall 1, which is designated as a quarantine facility\n. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n TRICKY BALANCE IN THE FACE OF IMPONDERABLES \n On Monday, Mr Lawrence Wong also called on Singaporeans to be psychologically prepared that the Wuhan virus could be worse than Sars given the many “imponderables” and “uncertainties” regarding the infection, though he stressed that there is still no evidence of community spread of the disease in Singapore. \n Over the past week, however, the first reports of human-to-human transmissions outside of China have surfaced in Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and Germany. \n Mr Lawrence Wong said Singapore’s approach “is to anticipate and move as swiftly as we can”. “But every action we take really has to be based on evidence, data and international medical guidelines,” he added.  \n Unlike Sars, which impacted Singapore when little was known about it, there is now a greater understanding about the coronavirus, a family of viruses that include the Wuhan strain and Sars. \n But data gaps still exist, said Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and a former director of the WHO’s research policy and cooperation department in Geneva.  \n Prof Pangestu told TODAY that not much is known of the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus the severe and fatal ones, which currently makes it difficult to evaluate the Wuhan virus’ true epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response. \n There is also the worry that the virus could mutate into a more virulent and more highly transmissible strain. “This needs close monitoring and another data gap will be in how quickly this development can be evaluated,” he said. \n Despite these gaps, Singapore has “reacted much more swiftly and comprehensively” than in 2003, Prof Pangestu added. \n  With the evolving Wuhan coronavirus situation, people are taking precautions to prevent the spreading of germs by wearing masks\n. Photo: Najeer Yusof/TODAY \n A rule of thumb for any country’s approach in health crises, he said, is to base decisions on scientific evidence and rational analysis in the context of its own capacities.  \n “I think the Singapore approach is the correct one given the current information and evidence available — robust but not over-reactive and flexible enough to accommodate new developments,” said Prof Pangestu.  \n He noted that overreaction risks imposing an unjustifiable burden on the country, potentially impacting normal daily routines and the livelihoods of certain vulnerable segments of the population. Underreaction, on the other hand, would lead to a more extensive spread of the virus. \n “Calibrating the balance is tricky, but as I said, base your decisions on the existing scientific evidence,” said Prof Pangestu. \n Prof Ooi from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health added: “There is a risk and cost to overreaction and a cost to underreaction. Nobody knows what is the right answer and there is no hard science to it — this is a judgement call and there is no right or wrong.” \n Where there is a dearth of knowledge on imported pandemic cases, Singapore’s national strategy is flexible with the changing circumstances, and the plan recommends taking border control measures that would “err on the side of caution with more intense efforts until such time when the disease profile becomes clearer”.  \n Addressing the media on Friday, Mr Lee said: “I think as a Government, in a way, we are overreacting because we are trying to look ahead to see what can go wrong and take preemptive steps to prevent that from happening.” \n Within a week, the taskforce moved from allowing travellers from Wuhan to enter Singapore while subject to enhanced screening on Monday, to imposing a complete entry ban on all nationalities who have been to China in the past 14 days on Friday\n. \n The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority has also stopped issuing all forms of new visas to those with People’s Republic of China passports. \n HANDLING A PSYCHOLOGICAL CRISIS  \n Although the memory of Sars may have faded for some, experts say that the psychological lessons from it have remained until today, such that more Singaporeans are aware of the need to cooperate with the authorities during a health crisis.  \n For example, social media is rife with examples of Singaporeans calling out bad actors, such as online sellers who hoard surgical masks to resell, or profiteering behaviour by certain businesses. The Government has also acted quickly to combat such behaviour.   But Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, believes that the Sars legacy can also be a double-edged sword: The prospect of another Sars-like epidemic might lead to needless panic, or worse, “kiasuism”.  \n  Surgical masks sold out at Guardian Pharmacy at Changi Airport on Jan 29, 2020. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n In a viral outbreak, being  “kiasu” means that people only think for themselves, preventing mutual cooperation from happening, he said. \n Urging Singaporeans to do better, Dr Leong said they should be prepared for the viral outbreak but not overdo it. If fear and panic take hold, they can overwhelm the country’s response “like a tsunami”, he said.  \n This means Singapore’s national response has to preemptively address concerns that could lead to panic, he said. \n “You have no time to get ready. Better to be ready (for the worst) now than not ready at all… There is little room for mistakes (that create more panic),” said Dr Leong. \n Dr Chia believes that Singaporeans are generally behaving in a rational way so far, based on his conversations with residents as an MP or his interactions with patients. \n “During Sars, there was a lot more fear and a sense of real danger for everyone\n. We had people trying to evade quarantine, refusing to cooperate or going for medical screening… But so far there are no cases of people who are trying to evade authorities, in other countries, yes, but not among Singaporeans,” he said. \n The rise of social media, which was non-existent during Sars, can also give rise to disinformation that fuels further panic. \n On the threat of fake news, SMA’s Dr Tan said: “Social media may do more harm than good in this kind of situation where fake news may spread faster than a virus and trigger unwanted behaviours. We urge all readers to exercise judgement when reading stories from various sources, and to keep referencing to official websites for accurate information.” \n STRONGER LEGISLATION  \n Compared with the Sars crisis, Singapore has more legislative levers now to deal with fake news and anti-social behaviour — the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act being one of them. \n Lesser known are the many enhancements to the Infectious Diseases Act over the years since 2003, which give the authorities greater powers to enforce orders that were issued in the fight against a gazetted outbreak. \n The Act allows people who break home quarantine orders to be arrested without a warrant and to be jailed or fined on conviction. It was amended last year to allow officers to use “physical means” to enforce the order by bringing an absconder back to the place of isolation, in lieu of arrest. \n It also makes explicit that persons under legal orders that restrict their movement in Singapore, would not be allowed to leave the country, unless otherwise permitted. \n The breadth of such powers in Singapore gives the authorities the ability to ensure that evasion tactics, such as those described by Dr Chia, cannot happen again\n. The issue became such a problem during the Sars crisis that the health authorities had to resort to draconian measures, such as installing video surveillance cameras in the homes of people who were ordered to be quarantined.  \n The lack of legal powers has created some difficulties for several foreign governments in dealing with the Wuhan coronavirus. Earlier this week, two Japanese citizens who were brought back to Japan from Wuhan on a chartered flight declined to go for medical screening when they landed in Tokyo. \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the Japanese Parliament: \"While quarantine officers did their best to persuade them to go for further tests, they refused, and unfortunately there is no legal basis to force them to do so.\" \n MORAL SUASION AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC COMMS  \n But over the longer term, evidence suggests that government measures such as quarantine and travel restrictions are not as effective as instilling a voluntary sense of social etiquette and responsibility among the people. \n Having a buy-in from the public is especially essential when the authorities need the people’s support to carry out certain measures, noted Prof Pangestu. \n  ​Preschool children getting their health checked by teachers at My First Skool at Buangkok Crescent on Jan 28, 2020. Photo: Nuria Ling/TODAY \n Prof Pangestu said: “You need the public’s cooperation for your measures to be successful, such as to follow good hygiene practices, be alert to any symptoms, promptly seeking healthcare, awareness of potential risks, and to counter the spread of misinformation on social media.”  \n This will be critical during the “surge response”— when situational changes cause a sudden need for the authorities to ramp up its measures, such as activating quarantine sites that are being held in reserve. \n A lack of moral suasion would erase the ability for the Government to implement these measures, experts said\n. They noted how in Hong Kong, protestors bombed a general hospital and a residential building that the authorities had wanted to use as a possible quarantine facility. \n Over the past week, South Korean protesters — mostly residents — also used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, which are about 80km from Seoul. \n Experts said cooperation from the masses largely relies on public education as well as proper and accurate communication of risk, which is not always a guarantee considering the complex flow of information in a crisis situation that can lead to miscommunication.  \n An April 2003 article in The Straits Times, \"All the right moves for Sars but info’s a bit slow, no?\", by its then news editor Bertha Henson, described how the MOH was asked at a press conference to confirm a tipoff that SGH nurses might have Sars. The authorities said no, but it later emerged the next day that 21 SGH staff were on the Sars suspect list. \n “The kindest thing I can say about this sudden announcement is that the ministry gets its information later than the media,” wrote Ms Henson then. \n Referring to the incident, Professor Chee Yam Cheng, the current president of the Singapore Medical Council, wrote in a series of memos about Sars in 2003 that “quick dissemination of information — and accurate information — is almost as important as transparency in a health emergency”. \n Prof Pangestu believes that in general, Singaporeans are united and support what the Government is trying to do to contain the situation. \n “But public reaction is hard to control especially with fake news on social media. The idea that ‘perception is reality, anything is the truth’ often operates in this kind of (crisis) environment. That is why public risk communication is so important,” he said.\n",

Lee博士今天在接受采访时回顾了一线医护人员在采购设备以保护自己免受致命病毒侵害时所面临的困难\n到2003年5月非典得到控制时，新加坡已有238人感染，33人死亡。五分之二的感染者是医护人员。\n虽然谭医生的诊所幸好没有遇到病例，但在新加坡疫情爆发的四个月里，它对Sars患者保持高度警惕，医护人员在这四个月里必须全副防护装备。但同时兼任新加坡家庭医生学院院长的谭博士说，每个人都没有做好应对危机的准备\n他补充说，许多人继续工作，但极为担心他们可能会把病毒带回家，使他们的亲人处于危险之中\n“新加坡的医疗从业人员准备不足，导致了惨淡的结果。从那时起，我们吸取了教训，并制定了措施，为今后的任何大流行事件做好准备。”\n他说：“我们今天就在这里，准备与2019年的nCoV战斗。\n1月23日，世界卫生组织（世卫组织）对武汉冠状病毒（即2019年nCoV）的临时名称）在新加坡首次得到确认。到目前为止，所有的病例都是进口的，包括一名在武汉的新加坡人，而且没有证据表明社区在共和国蔓延\n. \n世卫组织尚未宣布该病毒（已扩散到几个国家）为大流行。尽管如此，它在周五（1月31日）被宣布为全球卫生紧急事件\n首批病例在中国湖北省武汉市报告，据信与出售活动物的华南海鲜批发市场有关\n截至上周五中午，新加坡共有16例确诊病例，35例仍在等待检测结果，198例已检测为阴性，新加坡至今没有死亡病例。\n在这个城市国家的反应计划的核心是疾病爆发应对系统（DORS），这是一个危机管理计划，它不存在于2003，而是由Sars起草并在2009的猪流感（或H1N1）大流行之后再次被改进。\n2003年，为了预防非典，医务人员在一家媒体公司的演播室举行NKF演出前对客人进行例行检查。今日资料照片\n李显龙总理上周在瑞士达沃斯出席世界经济论坛期间说：“非典之后，我们对我们拥有的设施进行了彻底的评估，包括基础设施、医院、隔离病房、科学测试和能力。”\n“我想我们现在准备得好多了。”\n目前，新加坡正处于多尔松状态（Dorscon）黄色，表明该病毒严重，可在人与人之间传染，但主要发生在新加坡以外地区。下一步是多尔森奥兰治（Dorscon Orange），它本可以应用于非典型肺炎（Sars）病例中，病毒在新加坡传播，但传播范围不广，目前正在得到控制。\n医学专家和非典退伍军人今天告诉记者，虽然计划已经实施，一些措施已经启动，但新加坡的国家战略仍然基本上没有得到检验，因为据信武汉冠状病毒在共和国尚处于早期阶段\n. \n不过，他们表示，有充分迹象表明，随着新加坡加强防御，非典的教训正在得到应用。他们认为，与非典时期不同的是，新加坡现在准备得更充分了。\n吸取的教训\n在最近的记忆中，新加坡经历了两次大流行——非典和H1N1。\n虽然新加坡能够控制和恢复这两种病毒，但病毒的不同性质以及医学的变化意味着处理每一种病毒需要不同的方法。\n医生在治疗非典型肺炎病人时有有限的选择，只能实施支持性护理，而且没有任何办法可以预防感染。相比之下，当H1N1在新加坡夺去了18条生命，感染了40多万人时，疫苗和治疗方案是可用的，其中约1300人必须住院治疗。\n非典型肺炎于2003年2月底首次抵达新加坡，并于2003年3月1日在谭托克生医院（TTSH）发现一名患有非典型肺炎的妇女。当时，没有人知道它的致命性和毒性，第一个病人在医院里导致了42个病例的聚集\n卫生部（MOH）任务组于3月15日成立，两周前在新加坡发生了神秘的毒株，世卫组织发布了一个全球警报，开始于香港爆发的三天。\n但《奥地利东南亚研究杂志》（Austrian Journal of South east Asian Studies）2012年发表的一份研究报告称，当时的指挥和控制结构在一个变化无常、史无前例的危机形势下“完全不够”。\n在2003年参加祈祷之前，新创造教堂的热成像系统会对教堂的信徒进行体温检测。今日资料照片\n当局于2020年1月24日在大士检查站进行温度检测\n. 照片：Najeer

Boon说，他们来自李光耀公共政策学院。\n他们指出，在第一个病例被报告后，官僚机构花了五个星期才适应，不过到那时，疫情已经很快从TTSH蔓延出去\n2003年4月7日，为应对非典，成立了一个由9名成员组成的部际委员会，由时任内政部长黄侃生领导，在卫生危机期间提供战略和政治指导。\n帮助跨部门协调是一个由高级公务员组成的核心执行小组，以及一个跨部门的业务委员会。他们的职能后来在H1N1流感危机期间得到巩固，这意味着这种精简的官僚机构能够更快地应对当地出现的新情况。\n对于武汉冠状病毒，观察人士今天表示，在建立多学科决策机构方面，政府的反应显然比非典和H1N1更迅速\n索斯威霍克公共卫生学院传染病专家和病毒学家吴英昂教授指出，武汉冠状病毒多部门工作组于1月22日成立，几个小时后，第一例疑似病例于当天晚上10点提请当局注意。这位66岁的来自武汉的中国游客第二天检测呈阳性，成为新加坡首例确诊病例\n.\n欧教授说：“如果你看看反应时间，事实上，在这起案件出现之前，部长委员会就已经成立了，我们可以看到，很多制度已经到位，发生在各个部委之间，不像当年非典让我们大吃一惊时那样孤立。”，世卫组织还担任杜克国立大学医学院新兴传染病方案副主任。\n该工作组的成立是为了指导政府应对疫情的整个行动，协调公众的反应，并与国际社会合作。\n该工作组由卫生部长甘金勇和国家发展部部长王立军共同主持，由内阁各部部长组成。他们是：\n顾问：韩副总理\nS Iswaran先生，通信和信息部长\n工商部部长陈振成\n环境和水资源部长Masagos Zulkifli先生\n全国工会大会秘书长吴奇孟先生\n教育部部长翁业功先生\n人力资源部长兼民政事务第二部长何秀芬女士\n社会和家庭发展部长戴斯蒙德·李先生\n交通、通信和信息国务高级部长Janil Puthucheary博士\n担任政府议会卫生委员会主席的丹戎帕加尔GRC议员Chia Shi Lu博士说，这一次，指挥系统更加清晰。\n他指出，甚至在特遣部队成立之前，卫生部就已经开始跟踪中国今年年初的疫情。樟宜机场早在1月3日就已采取了降温措施。\n但Chia博士指出，专家组的高度政治性特征导致一些人质疑是否有太多的厨师在破坏肉汤。“事实上，有人问我：我们做得过火了吗？“他说\n. \n他补充说：“我认为，每个人都要参与进来，这一点非常重要——你必须这样做，因为在这个早期阶段，（疫情爆发）影响到这么多不同的部分，你需要他们的领导，你不能仅仅依靠卫生部来协调一切。”。\n虽然有关武汉病毒的信息仍在不断涌现，但新加坡与2003年非典爆发初期的情况并不相同，用当时的卫生部长林荣江的话说，当时的情况是“盲目飞行”\n在非典危机期间，新加坡只有两种方法来检测感染者：他们的临床症状和旅行史。检测这些在当时并不容易，因为温度筛选机也是一种罕见的资源，不像今天。\n“我们必须依赖于人们的体温，我们必须依赖于人们在他们的接触史上对我们诚实，”当时林先生说，他形容非典是一个巨大的挑战。\n新加坡医学会（SMA）第一副会长谭耀泳博士说，在非典危机中，“未知数太多，预防措施来得太晚、太慢”。Sars在自然界是人畜共患的疾病，这种疾病在动物身上开始传播，然后传播到人类身上\n她说，因此，随着疫情的爆发，有关风险分层、接触图绘制、接触者追踪、检疫等方面的政策和程序正在迅速发展。\n“今天，上述各项以前都是在演习中开发和试验的，现在已经付诸实施。当然，这些计划、政策和程序必须根据该病的流行病学进行修改，但我们并不是白手起家，不像过去的非典经验，”她补充说\n2003年非典期间谭托克生医院的中危区。今日资料照片\n谭托克生医院通知来访者和病人武汉冠状病毒\n. 照片：Raj Nadarajan/今天\n周一，劳伦斯•黄在接受媒体采访时表示，在工作组对病毒的全国性反应中，它能够“调动所有可用资源”来对付这一祸害。\n在能力方面，新加坡自2003年以来已经加强了医疗和隔离能力。他说，这包括去年开放的有330张床位的国家传染病中心，以及2010年的霍德培医院、2015年的吴登芳总医院和2018年的盛港总医院等新医院。\n在非典期间，TTSH被称为“非典中心”，是处理病人的指定医院。这是由于一项限制将病毒传播到其他医院的政策所证实的，此前，一名患者在新加坡综合医院（SGH）出院后前往那里接受外科手术时，不知道自己在TTSH期间感染了病毒，在新加坡综合医院创建了一个新的病毒群\n这项政策在2009年H1N1疫情期间发生了变化，卫生部通过及时调整《传染病法》，对所有医疗设施实施了标准化的感染控制措施。400多家家庭诊所已经准备好了H1N1病毒，并配备了达菲疫苗来应对疫情。\n同样，所有公立医院都有能力处理武汉病毒，并配备隔离室，这些隔离室在2003年供不应求\n谈到医疗用品，Chia博士回忆说，当时几乎没有为医护人员储备N95呼吸机等个人防护装备。\n“因为N95口罩需要很好的配合才能发挥其功能，所以在非典期间（很难买到）有一个合适的口罩，我们也必须找时间来做这个配合，”处于危机最严重时期的新加坡国立卫生院骨科医生Chia博士说\n“今天，我们大多数人已经配备了自己的个人设备，即使是新员工\n. 今天一切都准备好了。”。\n进入格伦伊格尔斯医院的访客、工作人员和患者必须在入口处接受检查。摄影：Justin Ong/今天\n政府将在2月1日至2月9日的一次性演习中，向137万新加坡家庭每人发放一包4个口罩。2003年，所有家庭都得到了一个免费的急救箱，里面有N95口罩和温度计。\n这一次，由于人们叫嚣着要购买口罩，岛上各地药店排起了长队，口罩分发工作正在进行中，零售商说，他们的外科口罩和N95口罩库存正在减少或售罄。政府在9天内从库存中向零售商发放了500万个口罩，但这些口罩都在数小时内被抢购一空\nChia博士说：“这个信息是，这里有足够的人口，也有足够的储备。”\nSMA的谭博士说，协会在春节周末与新加坡家庭医生学院会面，进行“复杂的后勤安排”，以确保外科和N95口罩的稳定供应，为一线医护人员补充库存。\n他说：“我们都在密切关注局势，并准备在需要时加大努力。”。\n专家们注意到，应急计划也已经到位——学生宿舍被改造成隔离设施，以防将来发生病例，位于普兰岛的新加坡出境游也被标记为可能的隔离地点。\n南洋理工大学研究生院1号，被指定为检疫机构\n。照片：Raj Nadarajan/今天\n面对无法估量的事物时的微妙平衡\n周一，王永明还呼吁新加坡人做好心理准备，考虑到在感染方面存在许多“无法估量”和“不确定因素”，武汉病毒可能会比非典更严重，不过他强调，目前仍没有证据显示这种疾病在新加坡社区传播。\n然而，在过去的一周里，在中国以外的台湾、日本、越南和德国出现了第一批人与人之间传播的报告。\n劳伦斯•黄表示，新加坡的做法“是尽可能快地预见并采取行动”。他补充说：“但我们采取的每一项行动都必须以证据、数据和国际医疗准则为基础。”\n与非典不同，非典在鲜为人知的情况下影响了新加坡，现在人们对冠状病毒有了更深入的了解，冠状病毒是一个包括武汉株和非典在内的病毒家族。\n但数据差距仍然存在，Tikki Elka Pangestu教授说，他是李光耀公共政策学院的访问研究员，也是日内瓦世卫组织研究政策与合作部的前主任。\n彭士图教授今天表示，目前对轻症和无症状病例与重症和致命病例的比例知之甚少，这使得目前难以评估武汉病毒的真正流行潜力，并使疫情应对复杂化。\n人们还担心，这种病毒可能变异成一种毒性更强、传播能力更强的病毒株。他说：“这需要密切监控，另一个数据缺口将是评估这一发展的速度。”。\n尽管存在这些差距，但与2003年相比，新加坡的反应“更加迅速和全面”。\n随着武汉冠状病毒疫情的不断发展，人们戴着口罩采取预防措施防止病菌传播\n. 图片来源：Najeer Yusof/今天\n他说，任何国家应对健康危机的方法的经验法则，都是以科学证据和自身能力范围内的理性分析为基础做出决定\n“我认为新加坡的方法是正确的，考虑到现有的信息和证据-稳健的，但不是过度反应和灵活，足以适应新的发展，”Prof Pangestu说。\n他指出，过度反应有可能给国家带来不合理的负担，可能影响正常的日常生活和某些弱势群体的生计。另一方面，反应不足会导致病毒更广泛的传播。\n“校准平衡是棘手的，但正如我所说，把你的决定现有的科学证据，”Prof Pangestu说。\nSaw-Swee Hock公共卫生学院的Ooi教授补充道：“过度反应有风险和成本，反应不足也有成本。没有人知道什么是正确的答案，也没有难懂的科学——这是一个判断的召唤，没有对错之分。”\n在对进口大流行病例缺乏了解的情况下，新加坡的国家战略在不断变化的情况下是灵活的，该计划建议采取边境控制措施，“在疾病轮廓变得更清楚的时候”，在“更加谨慎”的情况下“谨慎行事”。\n李明博周五在接受媒体采访时表示：“我认为，作为一个政府，在某种程度上，我们反应过度，因为我们正试图向前看，看看会出现什么问题，并采取先发制人的措施，防止这种情况发生。”\n在一周内，特别工作组从允许从武汉来的旅客在周一接受加强检查的情况下进入新加坡，改为在周五对过去14天来中国的所有国籍实施全面的入境禁令\n.\n移民和检查站管理局还停止向持有中华人民共和国护照的人发放各种形式的新签证。\n处理心理危机\n虽然对一些人来说，非典的记忆可能已经褪去，但专家说，从非典中汲取的心理教训一直延续到今天，因此，更多的新加坡人意识到在健康危机期间需要与当局合作\n例如，社交媒体上充斥着新加坡人叫嚣不良行为者的例子，比如网上卖家囤积外科口罩转售，或者某些企业牟取暴利的行为。政府也迅速采取行动打击这种行为。但伊丽莎白诺夫纳山医院传染病专家梁浩南博士认为，非典的后遗症也可能是一把双刃剑：再次出现类似非典的疫情可能会导致不必要的恐慌，或者更糟的是“克钦独立主义”\n2020年1月29日，樟宜机场卫士药房的外科口罩售罄\n他说，在病毒爆发时，成为“kiasu”意味着人们只为自己着想，阻止了相互合作的发生。\n梁振英博士敦促新加坡人做得更好，他说，他们应该为病毒爆发做好准备，但不能做得过火。他说，如果恐惧和恐慌占据了上风，它们会“像海啸一样”压倒国家的反应\n他说，这意味着新加坡的国家应对措施必须先发制人地解决可能导致恐慌的担忧。\n“你没有时间准备。梁振英博士说：“现在最好做好准备（最坏的情况下），而不是一点都不准备……犯错误（造成更多恐慌）的空间很小。”。\nChia博士认为，根据他作为议员与居民的对话或与病人的互动，到目前为止，新加坡人的行为总体上是理性的。\n“非典期间，每个人都有更多的恐惧和真正的危险感\n. 我们曾有人试图逃避检疫，拒绝合作或去做医学检查……但到目前为止，还没有人试图逃避当局，在其他国家，是的，但在新加坡人中没有。”。\n社交媒体的兴起，在Sars时期是不存在的，也会引起虚假信息，从而进一步加剧恐慌。\n关于假新闻的威胁，SMA的谭博士说：“在这种假新闻传播速度可能超过病毒并引发不必要行为的情况下，社交媒体可能弊大于利。我们敦促所有读者在阅读来自不同来源的报道时作出判断，并不断参考官方网站以获取准确信息。”\n加强立法\n与非典危机相比，新加坡现在有更多的立法手段来处理假新闻和反社会行为——网络虚假和操纵行为的保护就是其中之一。\n鲜为人知的是自2003年以来对《传染病法》的许多改进，这些改进赋予了当局更大的权力，以执行在与一次已公布的疫情作斗争时发布的命令。\n该法允许违反家庭隔离令的人在没有逮捕令的情况下被逮捕，并在定罪后被监禁或罚款。去年修改后，允许警员使用“物理手段”执行命令，将潜逃者带回隔离地点，代替逮捕。\n它还明确规定，除非另有许可，否则根据限制其在新加坡流动的法律命令的人不得离开新加坡。\n新加坡拥有如此广泛的权力，使当局有能力确保类似于Chia博士所描述的逃避策略不会再次发生\n. 在非典危机期间，这个问题变得如此严重，以至于卫生当局不得不采取严厉的措施，例如在被下令隔离的人的家中安装视频监控摄像机\n由于缺乏法律权力，一些外国政府在处理武汉冠状病毒方面遇到了一些困难。本周早些时候，两名乘坐包机从武汉带回日本的日本公民在东京降落时拒绝接受体检。\n首相安倍晋三对日本国会说：“虽然检疫官员尽力劝说他们去做进一步的检查，但他们拒绝了，不幸的是，没有法律依据迫使他们这样做。”\n道德劝诫与公共传播的重要性\n但从长期来看，有证据表明，政府采取的隔离和旅行限制等措施，不如在民众中灌输一种自愿的社会礼仪和责任感那么有效。\n当当局需要人民的支持来执行某些措施时，让公众的支持尤其重要，潘基斯托教授指出。\n2020年1月28日，学龄前儿童在我的第一个婴儿车上接受老师的健康检查\n潘基斯托教授说：“你需要公众的合作，才能使你的措施取得成功，比如遵循良好的卫生习惯，警惕任何症状，迅速寻求医疗保健，意识到潜在的风险，并阻止错误信息在社交媒体上的传播。”\n这将在“激增反应”期间至关重要——当情况变化导致当局突然需要加强其措施时，例如激活被保留的检疫点。\n专家们说，缺乏道德劝说会抹去政府执行这些措施的能力\n. 他们指出，在香港，抗议者轰炸了一家综合医院和一幢住宅楼，当局希望以此作为可能的检疫设施。\n在过去的一周里，韩国抗议者——大部分是当地居民——还使用拖拉机，阻止他们进入距离首尔约80公里的阿桑市和金川市指定为检疫中心的设施。\n专家表示，群众的合作在很大程度上取决于公众的教育以及对风险的适当和准确的沟通，考虑到危机情况下复杂的信息流动可能导致沟通不畅，这并不总是一种保证\n2003年4月在《海峡时报》上发表的一篇文章说，“对非典来说，一切都是正确的，但信息有点慢，不是吗？”该报时任新闻编辑伯莎·汉森（Bertha Henson）描述了卫生部在记者招待会上如何被要求证实SGH护士可能患有Sars的消息。当局说没有，但第二天晚些时候发现21名SGH工作人员被列入非典嫌疑人名单。\n“对于这一突然宣布，我能说的最好听的一件事是，外交部比媒体更晚获得信息，”当时汉森写道。\n谈到这一事件，新加坡医学会现任主席郑智彦教授在2003年的一系列关于非典的备忘录中写道，“快速传播信息——准确的信息——几乎与卫生紧急情况下的透明度同等重要”。\n潘基斯托教授认为，总体而言，新加坡人是团结一致的，支持政府为遏制局势所做的努力。\n但公众的反应很难控制，尤其是在社交媒体上的假新闻。在这种（危机）环境中，“感知即现实，一切即真理”的观念经常起作用。这就是公共风险沟通如此重要的原因。”。\n",

It earlier fell as much as 1 per cent to 1.3853. \n The MAS said that the Singdollar has been fluctuating near the upper bound of the policy band since its last review in October, when it reduced slightly the Singdollar appreciation rate, the first easing since April 2016. \n “There is therefore sufficient room in the band... to ease in line with any weakness in the Singapore economy in the coming months,” the MAS said. \n A weaker currency, corresponding to policy easing, makes imports more expensive in Singdollar terms, while making Singapore exports more competitive. \n The Singdollar is weighed against a basket of currencies, and it is allowed to fluctuate within an unspecified band, unlike most central banks that use interest rates to manage their currencies. The MAS regulates the Singdollar by buying or selling the currency when it goes out of the band.  \n The MAS added that it is “monitoring economic developments closely” and that the next half-yearly monetary policy review “remains as scheduled” in April this year\n. \n DBS Bank foreign exchange strategist Philip Wee said: “The MAS statement tells us that there will be no urgency for an inter-meeting easing in the Singdollar policy before the next scheduled policy review.” \n He notes that the appreciation of the Singdollar “has held in the stronger half of the policy band throughout the United States-China trade war”. \n “Singapore averted a technical recession because the impact from the trade war was not broad-based and confined mostly to trade and manufacturing,” he added. \n “Given the potential negative spillover from the coronavirus into domestic demand and services... it is not unreasonable for the (Singapore) currency to reposition at a more neutral level, currently just below the mid-point of the policy band,” said Mr Wee. \n He predicts that a further deterioration in the coronavirus outbreak would keep the Singdollar in the lower half of the band - between $1.376 to $1.403 against the US dollar.  \n The bank is keeping to its Singdollar forecast of $1.40 against the greenback by March. \n Maybank foreign exchange research head Saktiandi Supaat said: “The severity of the outbreak and its impact on the local economy, especially the tourism industry and sectors such as manufacturing tied to Chinese demand, will likely come into policy consideration (for the upcoming review).” \n He noted that potential measures targeted at the tourism and consumer sectors, as announced by the Government might also help allay market concerns. \n He added: “But our baseline view is still that the outbreak would be contained at some point,” he added.  \n CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said that the virus outbreak has made it clear that Singapore is in for a tough first quarter, but the economic forecast remains unchanged so far. \n “We are not in that period of great uncertainty yet,” he said, adding that economic indicators such as growth and inflation have not began flashing warning signs\n.  \n Correction: The headline of an earlier version of the article said there is \"sufficient room\" for monetary policy to ease. That is incorrect.  It should be \"sufficient room\" for the Singapore dollar to ease within MAS' current policy band. We are sorry for the error.\n",

Most diagnosed cases and almost all deaths (except one) occurred in China, mainly in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. This is where the outbreak started.\nThe Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed, by means of a statement, \"that the laboratory tests carried out by Insa [National Health Institute Dr. Ricardo Jorge] were all negative\". The public had already ascertained this information before.\nThe material used for analysis (zaragatoas) was collected on Sunday after a National Reference Laboratory (Insa) team for carrying out these analyses went to Pulido Valente Hospital and Health Park, where the repatriated 20 have been installed and \"where will remain in prophylactic isolation for 14 days\". During this time they will not be able to receive visitors.\nPulido Valente Hospital is one of the units already prepared by the Ministry of Health to receive Portuguese displaced persons from the Chinese city of Wuhan who request to be quarantined, as it is not mandatory in Portugal. Compulsory admission is only provided for mental illness or extreme cases of public health risk, but it is necessary for the court to decide.\nOn Friday, the Director General for Health, Grace Freitas, had advanced that in addition to Pulido Valente Hospital (13 individual rooms), also the Port Military Hospital is prepared to receive some of these citizens. Availability that remains, although the health authorities have chosen to arrange ten individual rooms in the Health Park, for logistical reasons\nYeah. The lab running the analysis is in Lisbon.\nAt the press conference this Sunday, Health Minister Marta Temido explained that the 20 citizens accepted the proposal of the national health authorities to stay in the two hospital units in prophylactic isolation. Grace Freitas had already pointed out on Friday that they are housed in wards, although they are not sick. If such a scenario changes, the protocol will be activated which, in the light of a positive analysis, will move the patient to the Curry Cabral Hospital (Lisbon), which is one of the reference units for this situation.\nThese citizens, including two persons of Brazilian nationality and two Portuguese diplomats who were in Beijing and who travelled to Wuhan to follow the process of repatriation of the Portuguese, arrived Sunday night at Figo Maduro Airport, \"having been evaluated by the doctors of the International Sanity Team, coordinated by the DGS.\"\n\"Citizens will continue to be accompanied by two International Health Doctors, who will ensure active surveillance twice a day and will always be available for contact,\" said the DGS in the statement. The information is already coming in Sunday night at a press conference led by Health Minister Marta Temido. A new press conference is held in the Ministry of Health on Monday afternoon, where a new situation will be made.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nSo far, Portugal has had two suspected cases of coronavirus infection 2019-nCoV, but both have had negative analyses.

The index even devalued 9.1% during the day, the biggest fall of the last 13 years in back-to-negotiation sessions after the New Year celebrations in China, according to the \"Financial Times\". The impact of coronavirus on the economy may still be felt for some time to come.\nMore than 80% of the shares quoted in the CSI300 this Monday were devaluations of the 10% order despite the effort signalled by the Chinese authorities to try to stabilise the market, with the central bank injecting the equivalent of 156 billion euro into the financial system. The devaluation of that index, according to Bloomberg and the Financial Times, amounted to a 323 billion euro \"evaporation\".\n\"This pandemic is not something that only affects the market for a few days. It will last for a while\", envisioned China's president Vision Capital, Sun Jianbo, cited by Bloomberg.\nThe biggest impact is being felt on the Chinese stock exchange. In other financial areas, the consequences are slimmer. In Europe, for example, the Portuguese stock exchange was still depreciating 0.5%, but the main French index, CAC40, was still valued 0.33%. In Germany, the DAX index continued to rise 0.34%.\nLast Friday the DBRS financial rating agency had already released a note on the impact of coronavirus on the market. Although it is too early to calculate the economic impact of the virus in China, given the speed at which the infection spread, the impact should be felt mainly in this first trimester\", DBRS assesses.\n\"Consumption, especially in retail sales, must be affected, as people limit their activities outside the home\nYeah. Less sharply, production may also be affected temporarily by holiday extensions and possible measures to contain the virus. The spread of the coronavirus has led companies to limit travel to China, which will affect the hotel, catering and transport,\"DBRS says.\nCancelling flights to and from China and limiting travel could lead to a reduction in the consumption of petroleum products as a whole and thus lower the price of crude oil. The brent, oil whose price serves as a benchmark for European markets, is falling back 0.53%, trading at 56,3 dollars per barrel. In Portugal, the only quoted oil company Galp is depreciating on a 1,25% exchange this Monday.\nAlso some raw materials that are particularly dependent on the performance of the Chinese economy this Monday saw significant devaluations.\nOverall, the coronavirus has infected more than 17 thousand people, causing more than 360 fatalities to date.\n",

And if until yesterday the victims were all confined to Chinese territory, today the scene has changed. The Philippine Health Department announced Sunday morning the first coronavirus death.\nThe victim is a male of Chinese nationality, 44-year-old, who has been hospitalized at San Lazaro Hospital in Manila since January 25th with pneumonia caused by Wuhan's coronavirus. He died on Saturday night.\nAnd in China, which was so far the only country with fatalities accounted for, the deaths keep rising. Since yesterday (Saturday), the new coronavirus has victimized more 45 Chinese, raising to 304 the total number of fatalities. The number of people infected with the disease also rose to 14.380 plus 2.590 people registered yesterday.\nGermany has also recorded two new cases, identified among the repatriated citizens of Wuhan, with ten of the number of Germans infected with the virus, this Sunday the authorities announced. The two infected citizens are in isolation in a barracks in Germersheim (West Germany). The remaining 111 refurbished from Wuhan will remain quarantined in a military barracks, which has been empowered to do so. German repatriates are divided into groups into three closed units, with the aim of minimising the risk of contagion.\nThe pneumonia outbreak caused by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was detected at the end of the year in Wuhan. In addition to mainland China and the Chinese regions of Macao and Hong Kong, there are more cases of infection confirmed in 25 other countries, with new notifications in Russia, Sweden and Spain. Across the world containment measures are becoming increasingly tight\nYeah.\nThe Chinese town of Wenzhou, one of the most affected by the epidemic outside the epicentre of the new coronavirus, this Sunday imposed a mandatory curfew for its more than nine million inhabitants and drastically restricted motor traffic, announced local authorities. Residents are required to stay at home and only one person per family is allowed to go out every two days to shop. Public transport is suspended, as are long-distance buses. The main highways are almost completely closed to motor traffic.\nAs in other cities in China, public places such as cinemas or swimming pools are closed. Companies will not open again before 17 February and schools are closed until at least 01 of March. Wenzhou, who records 265 cases of infected people, is located in eastern China, more than 800 kilometres from Wuhan, city in the center of the country where the coronavirus appeared in December and has been quarantined since 23 January.\nIn an attempt to stem the escalation of deaths and the spread of the virus, the Chinese Government this morning issued a protocol for the treatment of the corpses of the coronavirus victims as part of the effort to control the outbreak of pneumonia. The measure makes it impossible for family members to decide where the victims are buried and to hold funeral ceremonies.\nThe remains of the infected should be cremated at a designated funeral home near the place where they are, so that they cannot be transported between different regions, reads in the protocol issued jointly between the National Health Committee, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Minister for Public Safety. Funeral or farewell ceremonies are prohibited and bodies must be disinfected and placed in a bag sealed by medical personnel. Funerals, in turn, must send staff and special vehicles to deliver the bodies according to the designated procedures\nYeah.\nTo help combat the outbreak, the University of Macao (UM) has been working on a rapid test kit that allows detection of the virus. In order to accelerate the detection of new coronavirus to UM \"intensified the development of a system to help combat the outbreak\", it can be read in the statement issued by the institution.\n\"With the help of Virus Hunter, a rapid test kit developed with the patented technology of UM, the entire virus detection process can be completed in thirty minutes\", according to the same note. The kit concerned is \"developed by Digifluidic Biotech Ltd (founded by doctoral students) and is supported by the patented technology of UM. One of the advantages is that \"allows frontline personnel to perform rapid on-site tests on patients with suspected coronavirus and thus help optimize the detection process\".\nAs the Express had already reported, over 60 countries have already activated contingency plans to stop the outbreak.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE: Since the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak was declared on Dec 31, 2019, Indonesia’s Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Indonesia Country Office have been working in unison. \n They have also collaborated to strengthen response measures in anticipation of the coronavirus with the first public information release on Jan 8. \n INITIAL RESPONSE \n As the situation worsened in mid-Jan before the Lunar New Year holiday with the lockdown of specific cities in the Hubei province, Indonesian Minister of Health Terawan Agus Putranto announced that a budget had been allocated specifically to tackle the situation, ensuring that adequate training, logistics and standard operating procedures were provided or updated to anticipate the detection of positive cases. \n The ministry had also carried out webinars since Jan 24 to increase the awareness and detection of the 2019-nCoV across the public sectors including health agencies, laboratories, hospitals and environment agencies within local provincial government authorities. \n As part of containment efforts, the government had placed mobile containers designed to prevent containment on standby at major ports should they detect any passengers fitting the case definition and presenting with symptoms. These passengers will be transported in these containment units to pre-identified hospitals and treated appropriately. \n A public information portal has been established to provide daily updates on the situation. \n The public can also access information through their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages with the following hashtag: #WaspadaVirusCorona. \n The Ministry of Health, through the Bureau of Communication and Community Services and together with the Directorate of Health Promotion and Community Empowerment, has issued many risk communication materials and posters online and via media broadcasts. \n SCEPTICISM \n Buoyed by the confidence in his country’s preparations in handling the virus, Putranto declared on Jan 30 that \"all (steps) have been taken to make sure that there is no outbreak (in Indonesia).” \n According to the latest reports on Feb 1, there are no detected cases in Indonesia reported yet. \n Sentiments among Indonesians and on social media, however, suggest some scepticism about these bold claims. \n One reason for this disbelief is the close links between Indonesia and China. The world’s second-largest economy is a major investor in Indonesia, which happens to be Southeast Asia’s largest economy. In the first half of 2019, Chinese investments in Indonesia reached US$2.3 billion, making up for 16.2 per cent of total foreign investment in the country. \n  \n These close links also suggest a strong presence of Chinese citizens in Indonesia. According to Statistics Indonesia, from January to November 2019, Chinese tourists to Indonesia numbered 1.92 million, forming 12.87 per cent of all incoming tourists into the country. \n At the time of Putranto’s statement, there was no restriction on Chinese travelling into Indonesia. The presence of many Chinese tourists made his claim that there will be no outbreak in the country incredulous, since it is impossible to detect Chinese tourists with latent or asymptomatic infections. \n As an anticipatory measure, the Ministry of Health had already tightened screening at airports and ports, especially for passengers who came from China. \n Indonesian Director-General of Disease Prevention and Control Dr Anung Sugihantono had earlier announced on Jan 27 that the Ministry of Health had stepped up alertness early to check the body temperature of passengers arriving from China via plane or ship with a thermal scanner arriving through all ports. \n Such measures may have given authorities the confidence that there was no need to restrict travellers from China into the country. \n URGENT MEASURES \n However, with the WHO declaring the virus an international emergency last Friday (Jan 31), the ground has shifted beneath Indonesia. \n On the same day that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus confirming that the global body had revised its risk assessment after crisis talks, in Indonesia more than 40,000 workers at a vast Chinese-controlled industrial complex in Sulawesi were quarantined in anticipation to reduce the risk of exposure to the community. \n That Friday, Indonesia also announced that it was preparing to evacuate nationals stranded in Wuhan with 238 people subsequently evacuated with four stating that they were comfortable with staying behind and three not being able to pass the screening to be fit to travel. \n The evacuated passengers, along with the flight crew, have been quarantined at a military facility on Natuna Besar Island, near the waters where the Indonesian navy had a standoff with Chinese vessels only last month over a territorial incursion incident. \n Although, on Feb 6, the authorities said they had yet to test those quarantined in Natuna for the virus as they are not showing any symptoms. The cost for carrying out tests can also be prohibitive, the health ministry noted. \n  \n On Feb 2, Indonesia also announced that it will temporarily stop flights to and from mainland China starting Wednesday (Feb 5) and bar visitors who have been in China for 14 days from entering or transiting in the country. \n Although there is no certainty that these efforts can stand up to the spread of an infectious disease, Indonesians should take comfort that its government is not ignoring the risks of an outbreak occurring. \n There is apprehension that detection may be lacking in Indonesia but the capabilities and capacity in the country’s health system are adequate to pick up any cases so there should be little reason to doubt their ability in this regard. \n \"Indonesia has a functioning early warning system and 100 hospitals in various locations that serve as referral (centres) and can handle cases with proper measures as well as effective infection prevention, WHO representative for Indonesia, Navaratnasamy Paranietharan, told Indonesian media last week. \n KEEP CALM \n In the larger scheme of things, the response measures carried out by Indonesia’s health ministry thus far is in line with the escalation recommendations as outlined in WHO’s online course for the 2019-nCoV. \n The WHO Country Office for Indonesia had supported the government on technical issues such as risk communication materials, clinical guidelines and response measures recommendations. \n Moreover, based on WHO’s report thus far, patients with the 2019-nCoV infection may present a wide range of symptoms. \n Most seem to have mild symptoms, with only 20 per cent progressing to a severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases death. \n There may be reports of asymptomatic persons being infectious and would likely fuel the spread of the disease. However, most of these cases thus far had presented only mild symptoms despite being detected with severe viral infection. \n Given the high human traffic volume and trade between these countries, the novel coronavirus is likely to present itself in Indonesia in the near future. But the government has taken all the necessary steps to give the country a fighting chance against the epidemic. \n Qing Yuan Pang served as an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization in Bangladesh and had previously spent time in Indonesia working on disaster monitoring and analysis for the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Affairs (AHA Centre) and was extensively involved in the emergency efforts for the Central Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in 2018. \n ",

We have been interacting with foreign affairs ministers of other countries, pharmaceutical ministry and civil aviation, defence ministry on the coronavirus outbreak.\"\n\"Even in Parliament session, I have made statements and shared all the necessary info in both Houses,\" he added.\nThe cases that have tested positive for coronavirus were also discussed in the meeting alongwith the measures that were taken to prevent further spread of the deadly virus that has already killed over 1300 people in China.\nThe government was informed about the two quarantine centres that are hosting 645 people who were evacuated from Wuhan. The camps are being maintained by Armed Forces and ITBP. All inhabitants are being medically examined on a daily basis. However, all these evacuees have tested negative for coronavirus.\n15,991 people are presently under community surveillance in 34 states and Union Territories. Out of a total of 1,671 samples, only 3 were found positive as reported earlier.\n",

The drugmaker had earlier fallen 5% after it said it would take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak.\nIt was a similar picture in Paris .FCHI, which clawed back some early losses as Renault (RENA.PA) shares turned positive. It was last down 0.1%.\nRenault had dropped over 4% on its first loss in 10 years as the car company set a lower operating margin goal for 2020, a crunch year for its planned reboot alongside partner Nissan after a scandal surrounding former boss Carlos Ghosn.\nWall Street futures EScv1 pointed to a slightly higher open.\nChinese health authorities reported more than 5,000 new cases of the disease, with the National Health Commission saying  it had recorded 121 new deaths on the mainland on Feb. 13, taking the accumulated total infected to 63,851 people.\nInvestors said they thought the economic impact of the outbreak would not be as deep as feared, with some also finding succour in a spread beyond China that is not as rapid as feared.\nOthers have latched on to the possibility of further central bank stimulus measures in response to any slowdown. China’s central bank, for example, has already pumped liquidity into its economy.\n“Our base case is that the virus can be largely controlled by end-March,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\n“The negative impact on the economy will be mostly confined to 1Q,” he wrote, predicting that growth would rebound from March on the release of suppressed demand and monetary and fiscal policy support.\nMSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was flat.\nEarlier, Asian shares had earlier risen towards their second straight week of gains, helped by hopes governments will make provisions to soften the impact on their economies from the coronavirus epidemic.\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.1% for a weekly gain of almost 2%. China's blue-chip CSI300 shares .CSI300, meanwhile, rose 0.7%, having staged a stunning recovery to claw back 95% of their losses made after the outbreak.\n“China is already easing its monetary policy and providing more liquidity while more stimulus is likely,” said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.\nIn its weekly number crunch of markets, analysts at BofA said there had been a record $23.6 billion pumped into bond funds over the last week and big inflows into almost everything else as well.\nThey also spotted that an interest rate cut in Mexico on Thursday had chalked up the 800th cut by global central banks since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. That works out roughly one every five days on average.\nStill, some did say they were dialling down bets on equities amid lingering uncertainty on how the crisis would unfold.\n“We have actually taken some money out of equities this week,” said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management.\n“Markets have been overly focused on the good, and not giving a balanced view on whether the stimulus from China isn’t effective.”\nIn currency markets, traders had other matters than the cornoavirus on their minds.\nThe euro EUR=EBS slumped to another near-three-year low, with worries lingering about slowing growth in the euro zone and rising political uncertainties in Germany.\nEuro zone growth slowed as expected in the last quarter of 2019 as French and Italian GDP shrank but employment growth picked up more than expected, official estimates showed.\nThe euro did not waver on the numbers, having earlier fallen to as low as $1.0827.\nThe single currency last stood flat at $1.08390. It has lost 1% so far this week and is on track for its worst two-weekly performance since mid-2018.\nOthers market players noted growing demand for the U.S. dollar.\n“Investors will surely avoid Asia for the time being and will shift funds to the U.S., geographically the most separated from the region,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar .DXY hit a four-month high and was last at 99.115. It has risen 1.8% so far this month. The U.S. currency has been trampling everything in its path, including emerging market currencies.\nBrazil's real BRL= has hit a record low forcing its central bank to intervene to prop it up, while Turkey's lira TRY= has crumpled to a near nine-month low.\nOil edged higher and was on track for its first weekly gain in six weeks, backed by expectations that producers will implement deeper output cuts to offset slowing demand in China caused by the coronavirus epidemic.

One of the new cases was a worker on a boat where the taxi driver held a party.\nA doctor at a hospital in Wakayama prefecture, where confirmed cases were being treated, had also tested positive and was in serious condition.\n“We will stay in touch with local governments and expand our testing procedures and treatment of patients in order to prevent the spread,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters, a day after a task force on the disease drew up measures to deal with it, including spending 10.3 billion yen from budget reserves.\nJapan recorded its first death from the virus, and the third outside mainland China, on Thursday when authorities said a woman in her 80s had died. She was only confirmed as having the coronavirus after her death.\nThe coronavirus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and some 1,367 people have died, most in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is capital. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.\nThere are nearly 450 confirmed cases in some 24 countries and territories outside China.\nJapan has confirmed 33 cases, as of noon on Friday, as well as the 218 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been moored in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, since Feb. 3.\nDespite the new cases, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said there was no evidence the coronavirus was spreading widely in Japan, although he said it might, and the government had to prepare.\nBut Hiroshi Oshitani, a professor of virology at Tohoku University School of Medicine, said the situation in Japan had entered a new stage.\n“We can’t contain it but we can slow its spread. How to do that is the question, we can’t lock things down as they did in Wuhan,” Oshitani said.\nOrganizers of the Tokyo Summer Olympics dismissed fears the virus would force the cancellation of the Games.\n“Advice that we have received externally from the WHO is that there is no case for any contingency plans of cancelling the Games or moving the Games,” John Coates, the International Olympic Committee’s coordination commission chief, told reporters.\nThe Olympics are due to start on July 24.\nEarlier, the first passengers left the Diamond Princess to be taken away in buses to complete their quarantine.\nThe alarm was first raised on the ship after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. Its quarantine is set to end on Feb. 19.\nThe ship, managed by Princess Cruise Lines and owned by Miami-based Carnival Corp, typically has a crew of 1,100 and a passenger capacity of 2,670.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "While the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday warned the novel coronavirus that broke out in China in December was a \"very grave threat\" for the world, misinformation, hoaxes and panic have been spreading almost as fast as the virus itself.\nAs of Wednesday, more than 45 000 cases of the virus had been reported in over two dozen countries, resulting in at least 1 115 deaths, almost exclusively in China. The WHO on Tuesday announced the new name of the virus: Covid-19.\nPeople have been quick to spread hoaxes and misinformation, conspiracy theories and \"cures\" via social media without checking the authenticity of these messages.\nFact-checking organisations such as Africa Check and PolitiFact have been battling to keep up with quashing these messages, which in almost all cases turn out to be false.\nHere are some of the more recent fake claims about the most recent novel coronavirus:\n-  Dettol surface cleanser can kill the 2019 coronavirus\nAccording to Africa Check, a photo doing the rounds on WhatsApp shows the label on a bottle of Dettol anti-bacterial surface cleanser.\n\"The label says the cleanser is suitable for kitchen sinks, baths, taps, fridges and bins. It also says the liquid has been proven to kill bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella, as well as viruses such as coronavirus,\" Africa Check says on its website as well as its weekly podcast, What's Crap on WhatsApp?\n\"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n\"Previously, specific Dettol products have shown to be effective against certain strains of coronavirus. They include the Dettol disinfectant spray, liquid, surface cleanser and wipes.\n\"But the coronavirus spreading at the moment, known as the 2019 'novel' coronavirus (2019-nCoV), has not yet been tested against Dettol products,\" says Africa Check.\n\"Once health authorities make the strain available,\" Dettol will test its product range against it, the company notes on its website.\n- A university in Ghana has developed a coronavirus vaccine\nAgain, this is a hoax, says Africa Check.\nGhana's Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) has not successfully created and tested a coronavirus vaccine, as claimed on the website News 7PM.\nThe claim was published on January 27 and has since been shared on Facebook and other websites.\nOn the same day the article appeared, the university issued a statement that reports of a vaccine were false, reported Africa Check.\n\"The attention of management of Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, has been drawn to the… headline circulating on social media on Monday, 27 January 2020,\" it read.\nThe statement is signed by Dr Daniel Bekoe, the university's relations officer.\n\"A quick check with the dean of the faculty of pharmacy, Prof Berko Panyin Anto, on the above news reveals that no such discovery has occurred.\n\"Again, we wish to state that the person alleged to have supervised the purported project (Professor Dr Israel Nluki) has no affiliations with KNUST. Management thus urges the general public to disregard such publication.\"\nAfrica Check says while News 7PM indicates that the article is meant to be satirical, it has none of the requirements of real satire.\n\"And junk news sites may attempt to excuse their clickbait content – taking advantage of a trending news topic or major tragedy – by claiming it's satire, when it isn't.\n\"And the article was shared on Facebook as real news, with no disclaimer that it was an attempt at satire,\" writes researcher Motunrayo Joel.\n- Cocaine kills the coronavirus\nAnother elaborate claim states that cocaine has been found effective in killing the coronavirus. No, says PolitiFact.\n\"Images of breaking news stories claiming that cocaine is the newest remedy to coronavirus are being reposted on Twitter and Facebook. One Facebook post from January 30 included an image of a bag of cocaine in the background of a news banner that says 'Cocaine kills corona virus' and 'Scientists is shocked to discover that this drug can fight the virus'.\n\"No, this grammatically challenged image was not from a real breaking news alert. This image is made by an online news generator. There is still no cure for the coronavirus,\" writes PolitiFact.\nDedicated site\nPolitiFact now has a site dedicated entirely to dispelling coronavirus-related rumours.\nSome of the claims refuted include that the virus was developed as a \"bioweapon for population control\"; that drinking a bleach solution will prevent you from getting the virus; that 10 000 people have died from the coronavirus; that the virus causes sudden death syndrome; and that it was \"leaked from a Chinese lab\".\nAfrica Check's deputy chief director Kate Wilkinson said: \"You should stay clear of any medical advice that doesn't come from a trustworthy source. Check with your doctor before you try anything.\n\"Don't forward messages to your friends and family about the supposed preventative powers of garlic and sesame seed oil.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Amid the Coronavirus outbreak that has crippled major businesses across the globe, Apple is also one of the companies that are scaling down the manufacturing processes carried out in China, which is the epicentre of the deadly virus. But, even though the production of the iPhone may be disrupted, Apple may not push back the launch schedule of the iPhone 12 series, as per a new report.\nAccording to Digitimes, citing some supply chains in China, the next-generation iPhone model, dubbed iPhone 12, may as well be launched in September without facing any postponements. Although the production of iPhone 12 models could see a snag, it will not intensify into causing a delay in the launch later this year. Apple could, however, push back the availability of select models from the iPhone 12 to meet any surging demands.\nThe report also mentions that Apple is anticipating higher demand for the iPhone 12 series units, owing to a production ramp-up for the A14 chipsets. The demand for A14 chipsets could be well more than 50 per cent than the same time last year for A13 Bionic chips because Apple is placing high hopes for its first 5G iPhone models. The A14 chipset will enable 5G connectivity on this year's iPhone models, which Apple is anticipating will churn higher revenue. Apple is said to release more new iPhone models this year, with 5G to be the mainstay among all of them.\nAccording to the Apple analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is poised to launch four 5G iPhone models this year. There will be a 6.1-inch OLED display iPhone with two rear cameras, another 6.1-inch OLED display iPhone with three cameras and a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor, and a 5.4-inch OLED display iPhone. But much before that, Apple is highly likely to launch the iPhone SE 2 aka iPhone 9, which is also tipped to support 5G networks.\nMoreover, Apple is also said to have stopped sending key people from the iPhone engineering team to China. The engineering team is responsible for validating various hardware and software aspects of the iPhone, such as the engineering validation, design validation, and production validation. The absence of engineers will delay the process of validation, which in turn will affect the iPhone manufacturing schedule for this year.\nPreviously, Apple had to shut its stores in China in the wake of concerns centring the Coronavirus. It has also asked employees to halt travel to China and other regions hit by the epidemic. The maximum number of cases of Coronavirus has been reported in a few Asian countries.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Robust iron ore prices drove BHP Group to its best result in five years, still slightly off estimates, with the miner saying containment this quarter of a coronavirus that is spreading around the globe should limit any economic impact.\nBHP’s underlying profit from continuing operations rose to $5.19 billion for the six months ended Dec. 31 from $4.03 billion a year earlier, the strongest result since the same period of 2015, lifted by lofty iron ore prices after last year’s supply disruption out of Brazil and solid Chinese demand.\nThe results were below estimates of a profit of $5.28 billion, according to analysts polled by research firm Vuma Financial. An interim dividend of 65 cents, 10 cents higher than last year, undershot forecasts for a dividend of 71 cents.\nThe dividend came in “below market as board takes conservative approach given coronavirus (63% pay-out vs 70% 3-yr average),” UBS said in a note.\nBHP has not yet seen a major impact on its business from the coronavirus that was discovered in China at the end of last year, and customers have kept paying for their orders, the miner’s new chief executive, Mike Henry, said on Tuesday.\nHe added, though, that other supply disruptions have lent support to iron ore.\n“We are moving all of our product. Demand remains pretty resilient. Prices have held up in part because of some other supply side disruptions,” Henry said.\nRio Tinto downgraded its forecast for iron ore shipments for the year on Monday after a cyclone off the coast of Western Australia earlier this month.\nBHP is the first among its peers to report its earnings. Global miners are all expected to have cashed in on last year’s higher iron ore prices, with a further boost coming as China pumped more money into its economy to alleviate an economic slowdown. China’s iron ore imports were at their second-highest level ever in 2019, further boosting profits.\nThe world’s biggest miner is positioning itself well in a world that is decarbonising, Henry also said.\nBHP is seeking to raise its exposure to “future facing” commodities copper and nickel, through exploration and early stage acquisition, he said, adding that it would be open to selling its thermal coal assets if it can find a buyer at the right price given the deteriorating prospects for the market.\n“We need more copper and we need more nickel,” Henry told reporters as he pledged to meet “social value” commitments.\nBHP has also been using more renewable power, is assembling targets to scale back so-called “scope three” emissions - or the emissions of its customers - and is completing a review into industry associations that it funds to ensure they comply with its climate change goals.\nAs it seeks to improve efficiencies within the company, BHP will also look at restructuring its technological operations and making more staff permanent, Henry said.\nShares rose 0.9 percent on Tuesday to $A38.83 amid an uplift in the mining sector after Beijing stepped up stimulus to cushion the impact of the corona virus outbreak.\nFree cash flow for the miner came in at $3.7 billion, compared with $3.6 billion a year earlier.\n",

The city of 11 million people, where the virus first appeared last year, is under virtual lockdown.\nChinese officials have said the apparent slowdown in infection rates is evidence the flu-like virus is being brought under control but global health officials say it is still to early to predict how the epidemic will play out.\nThe head of a leading hospital in Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to have succumbed to the disease, known as COVID-19.\nChinese state media reported that Hubei would adopt more forceful measures to find patients with fever to help contain the epidemic, on top of steps already taken to isolate the province.\nThe province will check records of all fever patients who have visited doctors since Jan. 20, and people who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications at both brick-and-mortar and online drug stores, Xinhua reported, citing a notice by the province’s epidemic control headquarters.\nThe World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies programme chief, Mike Ryan, said China had success with “putting out the fire” first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday were monitored.\n“Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,” Ryan said.\nThe number of new cases in mainland China excluding Hubei has now fallen for 15 straight days. The number of new infections ex-Hubei totalled 56 on Feb. 18, down from a peak of 890 on Feb 3.\nThe biggest cluster of infections outside of China is on a cruise ship in quarantine off Japan, where more than 540 out of 3,700 passengers and crew have tested positive.\nAround 500 passengers were set to disembark on Wednesday, although those sharing a room with people testing positive would have to stay on board longer, Japanese media and officials said. Many of those infected have already been transferred to hospitals.

Spahn added that Germany was well equipped with isolation wards in hospitals if they should be needed in larger numbers.\n“We are acting swiftly and adapting our reactions to the current situation, and unfortunately I have to say that the situation has changed in the past hours,” he said.\nIn Europe, Italy has become a front line in the global outbreak with 322 cases. Italians, or people who had recently visited the country, have tested positive in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Romania, Spain and Switzerland.\nA second person suffering from the coronavirus died in France as health officials tried to find out how the college teacher, who had not visited any country with a known outbreak, had caught the new disease.\nThe new coronavirus, believed to have originated from illegal wildlife sold in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has infected some 80,000 people and killed more than 2,700 people, most of them in China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday alerted Americans to begin preparing for the spread of coronavirus in the United States after infections surfaced in several more countries.\nThe announcement signaled a change in tone for the Atlanta-based U.S. health agency, which had largely been focused on efforts to stop the virus from entering the country and quarantining individuals traveling from China.\n“The data over the past week about the spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and expectation that we are going to have community spread here,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the CDC’s head of respiratory diseases, told reporters on a conference call.\nWhat is not known, she said, is when it will arrive and how severe a U.S. outbreak might be. “Disruption to everyday life might be severe” and businesses, schools and families should begin having discussions about the possible impact from the spread of the virus, Messonnier cautioned.\nIn a teleconference later on Tuesday, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC’s principal deputy director, said that while the immediate risk in the United States was low, the current global situation suggested a pandemic was likely.\n“It’s not a question of if. It’s a question of when and how many people will be infected,” Schuchat said.\nIn San Francisco, California’s fourth-largest city, officials declared a local emergency, despite having no coronavirus cases, in an effort to raise public awareness of the virus’ risks and boost preparedness.\nSeparately, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar told a Senate subcommittee there will likely be more cases in the United States, and he asked lawmakers to approve $2.5 billion in funding to fight the outbreak after proposing cuts to the department’s budget.\n“While the immediate risk to individual members of the American public remains low, there is now community transmission in a number of countries, including outside of Asia, which is deeply concerning,” Azar said, adding that recent outbreaks in Iran and Italy were particularly worrying.\nBelieved to have originated from illegal wildlife sold in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected some 80,000 people and killed close to 2,700 in China.\nAlthough the World Health Organization says the epidemic has peaked in China, coronavirus cases have surfaced in about 30 other countries, with some three dozen deaths reported, according to a Reuters tally.\nGrowing outbreaks in Iran, Italy and South Korea have raised concerns that coronavirus will surface in other nations and worsen in those that have already reported infections, further denting a global economy that had already been hit by a dependence on China.\nGlobal and U.S. stock markets fell sharply again on Tuesday, as investors feared the epidemic would further damage an already slowing world economy.\nThe White House’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the U.S. economy would be able to ride out any disruption from the global spread of coronavirus, adding that he did not expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to blunt the disease’s economic impact.\nU.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, however, said Republican President Donald Trump and his administration had been caught “flat-footed” and lacked a comprehensive plan to deal with the coronavirus. He called for at least $3.1 billion in additional funding to fight it.\n“The Trump administration has shown towering and dangerous incompetence when it comes to the coronavirus,” said Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat. “Mr. President, you need to get your act together now. This is a crisis.”\nTrump defended his administration’s response. “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world,” Trump said on Twitter.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it would be at least a year before a coronavirus vaccine could be made available to the public.\nBut Fauci said testing Gilead Sciences’ (GILD.O) antiviral drug remdesivir for potential treatment of coronavirus could be done in a “reasonable amount of time.”\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that Iran may have covered up information about the spread of coronavirus there, and he accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of media and medical professionals.\n“The United States is deeply concerned by information indicating the Iranian regime may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak in that country,” Pompeo told reporters as Iran’s coronavirus death toll rose to 16.\n“All nations, including Iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organizations,” Pompeo said.\nHis remarks, coming less than two months after a short-lived U.S.-Iranian military clash and the signing of a U.S.-China trade deal, could inflame tensions with Tehran and Beijing.\nBeijing last week revoked the credentials of three Wall Street Journal correspondents over a column China said was racist. The United States has said it was considering a range of responses to their expulsion.\n“Expelling our journalists exposes once again the government’s issue that led to SARS and now the coronavirus: namely censorship. It can have deadly consequences,” Pompeo said, referring to the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which also emerged from China.\n“If China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge” of coronavirus, he added.\nDespite the coronavirus epidemic, Pompeo said the United States still planned to host a special meeting with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Las Vegas in March.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was “too early” to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.\n",

IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nLower air traffic growth projections prompted Spanish travel technology firm Amadeus (AMA.MC) to forecast slower 2020 core profit growth on Friday, but it stressed the outlook did not yet account for the uncertain impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nTo deal with the drop in business, IAG said it was cutting costs, without giving details - joining the likes of Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM (AIRF.PA) which have announced similar plans.\nIt also said flight cancellations would reduce capacity growth this year, although CEO Willie Walsh said the group could start to add capacity if other airlines failed.\nAirline stocks have been among the biggest casualties of a stock market rout this week as coronavirus fears have gripped investors. At 0845 GMT, IAG shares were down 8% at 474.59 pence, while easyJet (EZJ.L) stock was down 3% at 1,075 pence and Finnair (FIA1S.HE) was off 3.4% at 4.922 euros.\n(Graphic: Europe's Airlines - here)\nBudget carrier EasyJet reported a “significant” softening of demand into and out of its bases in northern Italy - the center of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in Europe - and a reduction across its other European markets.\nIt also said it would be cancelling some flights, particularly into and out of Italy, and that it would make cost savings across its business, without giving details.\n“We continue to monitor the situation carefully and will update the market in due course,” it said, adding it was too early to determine the impact on its results.\nFinnair, meanwhile, warned of a “significant” fall in operating profit this year due to virus-related disruption.\nFinland’s national airline also said its was scrapping its 2020 capacity growth target, and would look into cutting costs by 40-50 million euros ($44-54 million), with measures under consideration including temporary layoffs.\n",

We know that people with infection were taken to places of isolation or quarantine in that general area,” Klausner said.\nUC Davis said no one on its main campus has tested positive for the virus, known as COVID-19, but “out of an abundance of caution,” three campus residents are currently in isolation. One of them, who is showing symptoms of illness, has been tested for the virus, but the results are not yet in.\nThe CDC’s protocol had called for coronavirus testing in individuals with a fever or respiratory illness who have a travel history or contact that could have led to exposure to the virus.\nCalifornia officials said this protocol had to be expanded in light of the “inevitable” local spread within the United States. At least 33 people had tested positive for the virus, but five have since left the state, official said.\n“The case from yesterday is giving the CDC a lot to consider on revising those protocols so more individuals will be tested,” said Mark Ghaly director of California’s Health and Human Services Agency, referring to the woman from Solano County.\nCDC Director Robert Redfield told a U.S. congressional hearing on Thursday that more test kits were being sent to California and the agency now backs expanded testing.\n“When a clinician or a public health individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus, so that’s the current guidance that went out today,” he said.\nNewsom said the CDC has pledged to send more personnel to California to track the potential spread of the virus.\nWith new infections reported around the world now surpassing those in mainland China, the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Thursday even rich nations should prepare.\n“No country should assume it won’t get cases, that would be a fatal mistake, quite literally,” Tedros said, pointing to Italy, where 17 people have died in Europe’s worst outbreak.\n",

If the situation does not change quickly and prices of industrial components begin to rise, an increased import duty will have the opposite effect on both consumers and growth,” a senior official said.\nThe Confederation of All India Traders has warned that stuck shipments for basic commodities have started to quickly deplete available inventories at wholesalers and retailers, and that prices might rise if the situation doesn’t improve by mid-March.\nOn the other hand, industry bodies have also warned that importers haven’t been able to put in new orders since mid-January.\nChina is India’s largest source of imports with $70 billion worth of products reaching Indian markets from Chinese shores.\nDespite this, a significant share of Indian importers across a broad range of sectors have continued to rely on regular trips to manufacturing hubs in China to place orders for products.\nWith these visits now called off, importers fear they would lose out once the situation normalises and importers from other nations scramble to call in their own orders.\nDomestic industry has also been rattled by rumours of China shutting down one or major seaports from March 1.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has led to a decline in the number of ships calling on major Chinese ports, including Shanghai and Yangshan, in January when port calls declined by 17 per cent, compared to the previous year, according to local statistics accessed by media.\nHowever, while other nations have decided to limit shipping from China, the Chinese government has not announced any diktat to close ports yet, senior government officials and diplomatic sources confirmed.\nChina is the largest container cargo handler in the world, processing 30 per cent of global traffic or around 715,000 containers a day in 2019, according to global financial market and infrastructure data provider, Refinitiv.\nThe International Chamber of Shipping recently stated that by implementing certain preventive measures for Covid-19, ports in China can continue to operate. It recommenced exit screening at all ports in the affected areas to isolate passengers displaying symptoms of the disease.\nAs of now, the government has ordered that Customs clearance facility remain open 24x7 at all sea ports and airports till May, official sources said.\nCentral Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) Chairman Ajit Kumar has written to all Chief Commissioners (Customs and Central Tax) asking them to work out the arrangement and deploy sufficient number of officers at all 'seaports, cargo stations, inland container depot, container freight station,' under central government jurisdiction.\nSources added that late fees arising out of delayed receipt of documents will also be waived, under certain circumstances. A help desk on the ICEGATE website, CBIC's e-commerce portal, has also gone live.\n",

But they have a strong ally in Bach, who is known to stick to his guns in adversity.\nUnder pressure around the world to fully ban Russian athletes from 2016, 2018 and 2020 Games due to doping scandals, Bach resisted, enabling them to compete as independents.\n\nThat upset many in the sports world and drew attention to his good ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nBach has full control over the IOC executive board, which will make any final decision on the Tokyo Olympics.\nContractually, Japan has no say. The terms stipulate the IOC has 'sole discretion' to assess risks and may scrap the Games for reasons including when safety is \"seriously threatened.\"\nThe host city and Japanese Olympic body also signed away any right to indemnity, damages or compensation from the IOC.\nBach, who won fencing gold at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, took over the IOC in 2013 and has led it through whirlwind change to make the Games more attractive to cities and sponsors.\nHe has a strong grip on the 100-plus membership, having presided over the appointment of about half since taking over.\nHe has also pushed through major reforms, including Games cost cutting, additions of new sports and an overhaul of the bidding process that gave more power to his executive board - without a single vote of opposition.\nRarely showing emotion, Bach is a strategic planner and rapid implementer, with deep experience dating back to the first meeting of the IOC athletes commission in 1981.\nWith a small group of advisers and senior IOC members around him, Bach was the driving force behind a surprise decision last year to move the Games marathons and race walks to Sapporo in north Japan, to avoid the summer heat.\nA source within the Olympic movement told Reuters he had been shocked by images of athletes struggling in desert heat during the Qatar world athletics championships so he took the unilateral - albeit legal - decision to move to a cooler climate. \"He did not want to see similar images in Tokyo in the summer,\" the source said.\n\"It came out of the blue. Who proposed this, when did they propose it? These are all things I want to discuss,\" Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said at the time, demanding explanations.\nReuters could not reach Bach for comment on that or his role in determining the threat to the Games from the coronavirus.\nThough keen to preserve the Tokyo Olympics, Bach will also be minded to protect IOC finances. Details for Japan are not known, but at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC paid about $13 million for cancellation insurance worth $800 million.\nThe Olympic body has contributed more than $800 million dollars to the Tokyo 2020's Olympic Games organisational budget.\nHowever, with the Games having only been cancelled in the past due to World Wars One and Two, Bach will undoubtedly do everything in his power to protect the IOC's prime product - and his own presidential legacy.\n",

It is not known how the man in his 50s was infected.\nAmid fears of a widespread outbreak, Attorney-General Christian Porter said Australia will expand the use of a rarely used law that would either designate some places as out of bounds or place the patient in home detention.\n“Under the biosecurity act, you could have the prevention of movement from persons in and out of particular places,” Porter told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n“You might have a major sporting event where people would be in very, very close proximity to each other and... it might be determined that the risk of transmission at a venue like that was too high.”\nThe law, enacted in 2015, has rarely been used outside Australia’s agricultural sector.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison last week said a pandemic was likely and Australia has moved to try and prevent the virus from reaching its shores.\nSince Feb. 1 Australia has stopped any foreigner from entering directly from China - its largest trading partner. The move has prevented thousands of students and tourists from entering Australia.\nSome Chinese students have traveled to a third country for two weeks, the incubation period for the coronavirus, which satisfies Australia’s quarantine restrictions.\nOne Chinese student who spent two weeks in Dubai was on Tuesday confirmed as Australia’s 34th case of coronavirus.\nAustralia has had one death, a 78-year-old man who was a former passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which was quarantined in Japan.\nKeen to temper fears, Morrison urged Australians to remain calm as some rushed to shops to stock up on supplies in case of a pandemic or restrictions of movement.\nMorrison said he has spoken with Australia’s two largest retailers, Coles (COL.AX) and Woolworths (WOW.AX).\n“They would send the same message I am sending you today. It is important that people just go about their business and their normal processes in a calm manner,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra.\n",

Washington County, Oregon, is about 600 miles farther north.\n“Our first concern is for this individual, to make sure they’re being cared for and is able to recover,” the health authority’s director, Patrick Allen, said in a statement.\nOregon officials are moving to trace any contacts the patient had with others to alert them to a possible exposure and how they can obtain medical treatment if needed.\nThe infected individual “spent time” in a school in the Lake Oswego school district and may have exposed students and staff at the school, the state agency said.\nThe Portland-based Oregonian newspaper reported the person is an employee at Forest Hills Elementary School, which is now being closed by the district through March 4 as a precaution.\nThe presumptive diagnosis was based on results obtained by the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory from a CDC-supplied test kit newly furnished to the state, the agency said.\nThe case arose in a person who was not previously under monitoring for possible exposure to coronavirus.\n“Public health officials are considering it a likely community-transmitted case, meaning that the origin of the infection is unknown,” the authority said in a statement.\nAs of Friday, the CDC was reporting on its website 62 cases of coronavirus confirmed in the United States. The bulk of those, 47 cases, are among individuals recently repatriated to the United States, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, aboard State Department-chartered airlifts.\nThat leaves 15 cases in six states the CDC counts as having been detected and tested in the United States through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21.

Thus, the European economy will suffer from the economic shock in China in the first quarter, there will be supply bottlenecks for the European and global economies, demand will also be dampened across Europe and globally, and liquidity bottlenecks for businesses are to be expected.\nStrictly speaking, the Covid-19 crisis will have a very large negative impact on the economy in the EU and the euro area, the Commission estimates. 2021 The economy will experience a substantial but not complete recovery. However, some of the direct negative consequences could be mitigated by swift and effective counter-measures taken by the EU and the Member States, according to an analysis by the Commission.\nThe EU Commission is planning a comprehensive package for this. This includes not only the generous interpretation of the debt and deficit rules in the Stability and Growth Pact, but also the aid rules. This gives the Member States the maximum scope to take their economies into their own hands. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The spread of the new Coronavirus hits the German economy in the middle of the flare.\nAs economic growth stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the previous quarter, Europe's largest economy is entering the current year without a significant backlash. The hope of a rapid recovery in the economy is fading, since the Coronavirus epidemic has now arrived in Europe and is now spreading mainly in Italy. The German economy is concerned about developments in Italy, the third largest euro economy.\n\"Germany's strongest trump card has developed into a weak point: the openness and dependence on exports and global trade,\" explained Carsten Brzeski, Chief Popular Value of ING Germany. Economists, however, do not currently expect a downturn.\nLast year, international trade conflicts and the cooling of the world economy have already slowed down economic development. At the end of the year 2019, the German economy ran out of steam. In the fourth quarter, gross domestic product stagnated compared to the previous quarter. The Federal Statistical Office confirmed provisional data on Tuesday.\nThe boom in construction investments supported the economy between October and December. On the other hand, consumption, most recently the engine of the economy, lost significantly after a very strong third quarter. Private consumption expenditure stagnated at the end of the year, and the State only slightly increased its consumption expenditure by 0.3 percent. Declining exports dampened development.\nIn the total year the German economy grew by 0.6 percent. This was significantly less than in the previous two years. Growth was as weak as 2019 last 2013.\nThe spread of the Coronavirus could, according to economists, delay the expected recovery this yeaYeah. Some expect a decrease in economic performance in the first quarter, others expect a further stagnation compared to the previous quarter.\nThe main concern is the development in China, where the Sars-CoV-2 virus first broke out. The second largest economy in the world is an important market for \"Made in Germany\" products. At the same time parts are produced in Germany for production.\nAccording to the Bundesverband der Deutsche Industrie (BDI), several industries are expecting bottlenecks in the coming weeks in supplies from the Far East, including electricity, automobile, pharmaceuticals and paper. \"Due to major uncertainties on the world markets, the German economy has already started in a weak new year,\" said BDI chief manager Joachim Lang recently. \"The effects of the epidemic further increase the pressure on our companies.\"\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has already lowered its economic forecasts for China and the world economy. The global economy is expected to grow by 0.1 percent less than previously assumed. IMF chief Kristalina Georgiewa admitted that there are still major uncertainties. \"Many scenarios can take place depending on how quickly the virus is contained and how quickly the Chinese and other affected economies are returning to normal.\"\nAccording to Commerzbank chief economist Jorg Kramer, the virus is expected to prolong the industrial recession in Germany by a few months. The first quarter will be bad in China. \"It is quite possible that this will reduce the GDP in the first quarter due to declining exports and lack of supplies.\"\nKfW-Chefswirtin Fritzi Kohler-Geib expects the economic stagnation in Germany to continue at firsYeah. However, if the Corona epidemic persists and also affects other regions of the world more, serious effects on external trade, among other things, would be more likely. \"The situation in Italy therefore concerns me.\"\nThe German economy warned of the consequences of the Coronavirus crisis in Italy. \"The rapid spread of the virus, especially in the north, is hitting the economic centre of Italy and is currently creating additional insecurity for the German export industry,\" said Volker Treier, head of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK).\nPublic coffers are well-stocked despite the economic weakness. Thanks to the continuing good situation on the labour market, social security contributions and taxes have been pouring heavily into public coffers over the past year. At the same time, the ultra-loose monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB), which was particularly controversial in Germany, provided relief. Because of the low interest rates, the State can borrow more cheaply.\nIn total 49,8 billion euros (previous year: 62,4 billion) the Federal Statistical Office recorded the surplus of the federal government, countries, municipalities and social funds last year. All levels of government contributed to this. The highest surplus was reported to have been 20,1 billion euros.\nThe surplus was a total of 1,4 per cent of gross domestic product, by 1,9 per cent in the previous year. Europe's largest economy last recorded a deficit in 2011. Germany, with the surplus, is far from the deficit limit of the Maastricht Treaty, in which Europeans allow themselves a budget deficit of three,0 percent of economic performance. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Berlin (dpa/tmn) How strongly does the Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 affect tourism? And in the face of the climate crisis, can I still go on vacation without a second thought?\nThese are two questions this year at the ITB Travel Fair in Berlin (4. to 8. May be discussed in a heated debate. The climate issue is a permanent burner for industry and travellers, and the virus is a new crisis.\nFear of Corona but still little impact\nWhat initially seemed like the local problem of a Chinese province has become an international threat: more and more people are getting sick and dying of Covid-19, the disease that the Coronavirus causes, especially in China itself. Flights to the Middle Kingdom were cancelled, cruise ships established in Asia.\n\"China is not a major travel country from a German perspective,\" says tourism researcher Prof. Torsten Kirstges. But the virus could also have a significant negative impact on the surrounding countries in Asia. \"An entire region could be under general suspicion,\" says the Jade University expert in Wilhelmshaven.\nConcerns lead to booking retention\nFirst signs of this are: Several German tour operators offer guests the option to cancel or convert for free until a few weeks before their trip to an Asian country, for example Thailand or Vietnam. This indicates that holidaymakers are beginning to avoid the region. Kirstges says that the new Coronavirus takes part of its uniqueness when travelling.\nAnd the ITB itself? Chinese exhibitors are also expected there, two have cancelled so far. \"We are prepared, but not hysterical,\" says David Ruetz, head of ITB. The Corona crisis is also having an impact in this country: according to the German Tourist Office, the decline of Chinese visitors is partly evident in various cities and attractionsYeah.\nTravel and climate: good intentions instead of real renunciation\nShould we take less vacation in the face of the climate crisis? Or at least less flying? The ITB has put sustainability back on the agenda. \"You cannot put travel under general suspicion,\" Ruetz says. Positive effects were often overlooked, such as the economic benefits for the countries travelled. The ITB was a platform for a fair discussion.\nAnd what do the vacationers think? The subject is being discussed. But almost no one actually changes their behavior. Prof. Kirstges puts the attitude of holidaymakers to the point: \"Wash my fur, but don't make me wet.\" The guest wants to get the impression that the organizer or the hotel cares about sustainability. He won't give up on himself.\nFlying is harmful, yet everyone flies\n\"All statistics show that this does not significantly affect travel behaviour, let alone that people no longer travel out of flight shame,\" says Kirstges. Travelling by plane is particularly harmful to the climate.\nBut can holidaymakers rely on their provider to be truly sustainable? \"The industry is sensitive, but most providers do nothing voluntarily,\" says Kirstges. \"No one deters customers without coercion and renounces sales.\"\nAfter the Brexit is before the Brexit\nAfter a long row it happened: Britain has 31st. Leave the EU in January. For travellers, however, this does not change anything: until the end of the year a transitional phase applies. Flights go as planned, you continue to come to England with an identity card. At ITB, therefore, Brexit should not be a major issue.\nIt is still unclear, however, how to proceed after 2020, for example in terms of flights from, to and through Britain. The German Travel Association considers a comprehensive air transport agreement necessarYeah. So can you book a flight over London to the USA for 2021, for example? \"Yes, probably no problem,\" says Kirstges. \"A solution will certainly be found there.\"\nLuxury travel and digitisation\nBoth topics are not new, but play a major role at ITB: the luxury travel segment and digitisation.\n\"World-wide luxury travel is a 14-percent of tourism,\" says ITB director David Ruetz. There is a change \"towards unattainable luxury, to experience, even to spirituality\". So less bling-bling, but exclusive sensuality. One question for the fair will be: How do luxury and sustainability fit together?\nThe tourism industry also discusses how it can become more digital. It juggles with keywords such as Blockchain or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Kirstges points out that many organisers have not even managed to send regular newsletters. \"Every year, digital high-tech saws are driven through the tourist village, but they usually run again quickly.\"\nInformation for visitors to the ITB Travel Fair\nThe ITB in Berlin is the largest and most important travel fair in the world. This year will be the 4th. to 8. In March around 10.000 exhibitors from more than 180 countries are expected in the exhibition halls around the radio tower. Trade visitors discuss important topics of the tourism industry from Wednesday to Friday. Private visitors are invited on Saturdays and Sundays to explore halls and exhibitors. This year's partner country is the Sultanate of Oman.\nThe daily ticket costs in the online shop 13 euros, there are 16 euros on site. Discounts are available for students and students, children under 14-year-olds do not pay admission. The fair is open to private individuals from 10.00 to 18.00. Schedule waiting times at the entrance. Last year, the fair was attended around 160.000Yeah.\nThe exhibition halls are accessible by S-Bahn, via the stations Messe Nord /ICC and Messe South. The red metro line 2 (Theodor-Heuss-Platz station) is also available. There are also fixed shuttle bus lines. Shuttle buses also run on the extensive exhibition grounds",

Several communities in northern Italy have been sealed off so that the virus does not spread to the economic metropolis of Milan, the tourist centre of Venice and other regions.\nThe Carnival in Venice is cancelled, as are all sports events, museums and schools throughout the Venetian region up to 1. In March, regional president Luca Zaia announced to stay closed. The carnival would actually have until Tuesday (25. In February). Meanwhile, three infected people died in Italy, the country with the highest number of confirmed diseases in Europe.\nThe number of infected people had increased surprisingly over the weekend in Italy. By Sunday evening there were already more than 150 cases, as civil protection explained. The region of Lombardy, which was economically strong, was most affected. Veneto followed. There were also two cases in the city of Venice. People had also been infected in Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Rome. More than 25 people were in the ICU, according to civil protection. Three older people died. The region of Lombardy reported a third death on Sunday (23). February) a woman who had already been treated in oncology.\nCities concerned closed\nThe government announced strong measures to stop the spread in the economically strong regions. The most affected cities were sealed off: no one was allowed in or out. It concerns the province of Lodi in Lombardy about 60 kilometres south-east of Milan, where around 50.000 people live, as well as the city of Vo in the province of Padua in Veneto with around 3000 inhabitants.\n\"The aim is to protect the health of the Italian people,\" said Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. First, security forces should seal off the regionYeah. \"If necessary, so will the armed forces.\" Anyone who tries to circumvent the blockades will face criminal prosecution.\nIn many cities and municipalities, schools, universities and much of the business were closed. Large events such as divine services, carnivals and sports events were cancelled. The Milanese Scala cancelled their performances until further notice.\nThere was an alarm in Venice, which is frequented by tourists around the carnival season. The festivities should end from Sunday evening. \"It is the most serious order that a regional president actually never wants to make,\" said Governor Zaia.\nThe extent of the outbreak in Italy is alarming. For comparison: 16 cases have been reported so far in Germany, twelve in France. Italy's Deputy Minister of Health Pierpaolo Sileri told SkyTG24 that he expected further increases in case numbers. \"It is clear that we will have more cases.\"\nIn South Tyrol, authorities were preparing for possible contracted infections. Kitas should stay closed for now. According to Conte, it is not planned to suspend intra-European travel within the Schengen area for the time being. From Italy \"no hospital\" should become.\nHigh vigilance in neighbouring countries\nIn neighbouring countries Switzerland and Austria, increased vigilance was called for. France is increasingly preparing for the spread of Sars-CoV-2. The situation in Italy is being \"closely monitored\", said Health Minister Olivier Veran.\nThe Federal Government is also monitoring the situation. \"Our embassy and the German consulates in Italy are in contact with the Italian authorities in case the Italian measures concern Germans,\" said the Foreign Office in BerliYeah. Returners from the affected regions of northern Italy were recommended to follow the relevant instructions of the Robert Koch Institute and the Federal Centre for Health Education on their websites.\nThe Robert Koch Institute said that travellers from Italian regions with illnesses developing fever, cough or shortness of breath within a 14-day period after returning home should see a doctor, indicating the journey. If possible, these people should stay at home, keep their distance from coughing and sneezing, or turn away and keep the elbow or handkerchief that they immediately dispose of in front of their mouth and nose. It is also recommended to wash your hands regularly thoroughly with soap.\nLufthansa continues to fly to Italy\nThe spread of the Coronavirus in Italy initially has no impact on the Lufthansa flight plan. \"We are monitoring the situation very closely,\" said a spokesman for the airline on Monday.

As the Japanese television station NHK reported, referring to government circles in Tokyo, the victims are an 87-year-old Japanese woman and an 84-year-old Japanese woman. They had tested positive and were taken from the ship to the hospital where they died.\nAfter two weeks of virus quarantine, the first 443 passengers who were still barely 3.000 on the cruise ship had landed on Wednesday. Until the day before, 621 infections had been detected among the people on board the cruise ship. All those affected came to hospitals.

In Hubei, too, the new infections went back to 349 compared to the day before 1.649. Several cities also reported negative numbers for the new infections.\nThe sharp decline in viral diseases is due to an adapted diagnostic procedure. According to the Health Commission, clinical diagnoses are no longer to include officially confirmed cases in the statistics.

Now only laboratory tests are to be considered, but according to experts in the past they have not always recognised obvious diseases.\nAs a whole, according to official information, so far 74.576 people in China have the mentioned lung disease caused by the Coronavirus.

The disease control and prevention centres reported new cases 31. As a result, the number of previously confirmed infections with the cause of Covid-19 lung disease outbreak in China increased to 82.\nThis week alone, more than fifty cases were added in South Korea.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Liu Hongshen, a Chinese doctor who once worked in the Moscow football club, introduced the situation of ganavirus to Talas barabashi, a Russian News Agency reporter. He believes that Europe will have to move by 2020 and gives Russians advice on how to protect themselves from disease.\n-Dr Liu, is it right that the European Football League has suspended the game? Champions League, European Union, national hockey and NBA championships are suspended. \"Here comes tennis, too.\"\n-It is necessary for the health of the fans. God bless, if someone gets sick in the stands, then everyone will be infected. The virus spreads very quickly, from one person to another. So I think it's the right decision to suspend the game.\n-It is expected that the Russian football league will be suspended soon, while the Korean Ice Hockey League has been suspended. Isn't that cool? You can play without an audience.\n-I think these games can continue in Russia on the condition that they are played without an audience. You know, the message from China is: older people are more likely to get the virus. Football players and ice hockey players - healthy young people who have good immunity. In these people, there are very few diseasesAbout I think the Russian football championships and the Korean Ice Hockey Championships can continue without an audience.\n-European Football Championships will be held in 12 cities in the summer. Someone said he was a threat in Colorado. Nor can we rule out the possibility that some countries, including Italy, have to give up the game. In this case, part of the game can be made up to Russia. On the one hand, it's great, but we can see foreign fans. What should I do?\n-If this is still the case, the European Football Championship will have to be rescheduled. It's unrealistic to get fans from Europe to Russia. Obviously, the transfer of the European Cup in 2020 will bring huge financial loss to people, but I think it will still suffer the loss of the European Championship. The game is going to be late.\n-How to say, why on earth did Russia come from your country?\nI want to correct you. This is not a Chinese virus. This is not Wuhan virus. Now it is said that the virus is taken away by people from the United States. Zhao Lijiang, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, said the same thing. That is to say, everything comes from the American troops in China.\nI can't say that 100% of the information is true, but it has spread in the world. I read every dayAbout It could be the economic collapse of a competitor that Americans want. I think it's true.\nAt the same time, I would like to say that the pattern of the virus raging in Italy is different from that in China. This is very important.\n-On March 5, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei sobianin, signed a decree establishing a high level of vigilance against new coronaviruses in the capital. According to the document, citizens from disadvantaged states in Colorado are obliged to ensure self closure at home within 14 days of their return to the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, since March 10, 2020, Moscow has banned mass gatherings involving more than 5000 people. A similar situation is in St. Petersburg. In your opinion, what measures need to be taken?\n-The government must close the border completely so that people from European countries will not fly to Russia. At present, the case of coronavirus infection in Russia is related to one of them going to Europe or European coming to Russia. The Chinese have blocked the border, and Russia should do the same. It is very important to close air traffic with Europe.\n-Rest day - the time for families to go shopping in the supermarket. Now the time in line in the store is huge. Should we go shopping?\n-As far as stores are concerned, I would like to say: limit walking to shoppingAbout It's better to restrict subway travel. There are many people there. If you need to buy something, go to the store. If you can stand it, you'd better not go shopping. In a word, you should wash your hands frequently and keep your mood. I know that many people are worried and scared now. My advice is: relax and relax. Just wash your hands and, if possible, wear a protective mask on the street. This is very important.\n-Open up a Chinese secret. What needs to be done to minimize the risk of pollution?\nAccording to the news I got from China, eat ginger and drink it in tea. It's very helpful. Ginger boils and drinks its soup every day. Twice a day. It will certainly help you recover and never get sick again.\nThere are doubts about the possibility of infection. \"People who die of flu die every year,\" they say Do you have anything to refute?\n-Coronavirus is not as terrible as many other viruses. It's just that the world is suffering from unnecessary information about the virus. Ganarius made unnecessary advertisements. Information comes from the world of China. I know that many people think that China's economy will end with information about Colorado, but you see what's happening in Europe now. And in China, people are recoverinAbout There is no calculation of who launched all the information. If everyone knew that the virus would spread all over the world, those who promoted it would remain silent. Look, how many old people die of flu and cold every year, complications. No one noticed. Television and the Internet now, of course, scream more than we need.\nWe know a lot of American movies that give us images of the end of the world because of various virus infections. There's even a direction for apocalyptic movies. In theory, can Colorado virus lead to human extinction?\n-Everything will be OK, because in China people are already treating diseases. There are now new cases in China, but no one has died. It can cure coronavirus. Remember, everyone is talking about AIDS? However, people have forgotten him, and human beings continue to live. This is a very good person",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Covid-19 continues to spread globally. These diseases have been confirmed by the staff of various ministries, the surroundings of the first group of people and even their family members.\nThe spread of HIV / AIDS has had a serious impact on the global situation, particularly the economy. National emergencies, combined with the global economic recession, cannot fail to affect the policies of the whole world. This is not only because officials are infected with the same infection, quarantined and cancelled visits and meetings. The epidemic could hinder the global political process and trigger new crises.\nElection in the United States\nAt first, the president of the United States said the situation in Colorado was under full control and called on Americans to buy securities. But as disease rates rise, White House optimism has nothing to do with reality.\nInitially, trap persuaded the nation that the United States was ready to fight covid-19. However, when the number of people infected reached thousands, the president had to declare a state of emergency. The springboard order to cancel flights from the EU has drawn more criticism, especially in Brussels. The EU is outraged that the president made the decision without any warningAbout This shows once again the cold relationship between the EU and the US. However, the original \"springboard flight restriction order\" did not cover the UK, which was the country where the Deputy Minister of health found corona velos. Although later measures were taken against the kingdom.\nLast week, trainmar met with the Brazilian delegation and with Brazilian official Fabio waingateng. Soon, they found coronavirus in the last place. Still, the president and his deputy, Michael burns, did not go to quarantine as recommended. The division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea is limited to one test showing adverse results. At the same time, Senator Lindsay Graham also met with members of the Brazilian delegation and decided to be held incommunicado.\nThe rise in incidence is one of the biggest challenges we face during President Trump's term. At the same time, these tests are the culmination of the US campaign. The president's foolish decision may make him vote in the near future. Democrats in particular blocked the Colorado virus initiative from the podium. Last week, Joe Biden, a potential rival in the election, put forward his country's plan to get out of crisis. And Democrats in the house of Representatives passed a special agreemenAbout In addition, the epidemic is a challenge to the entire United States health system. In the context of the spread of the virus, Senator Bernie Sanders's commitment can bring new voices to voters. However, Biden and Sanders were forced to cancel some rallies for public safety reasons.\nSchengen crisis\nItaly is one of the main sources of virus transmission in Europe. Rome's decision to close the national isolation and isolation of the population - 60 million people - immediately triggered a response from neighbouring countries. Austria, Slovenia, Hungary and Switzerland have tightened controls on the Italian border, checking travelers' health and asking for medical certificates. Travel and transportation are restricted. Since 16 March, Germany has closed its borders with Austria, Denmark, France and Switzerland. The virus has virtually eliminated the EFA.\nThe European Commission and Frontex, the European border service, confirmed that they had infected staff. If the spread of disease in the EU continues to worsen, it is possible to close the borders of the whole EU. Cases of coronavirus have been recorded in all Community countries. The crisis once again shows the fragility of European solidarity and the inability of the EU to act in unisonAbout The spread of this virus forces countries to choose their own strategies. \" The new migration crisis exacerbated the situation and spread across the EU's external borders.\nMarina Chino pagliarello, a professor at the London School of economics, points out that the eurozone is experiencing a convergence of two major issues: \"health and immigration, they overlap.\" In Europe, there is a lack of trust and solidarity. \"\n\"Europe is paying the price for lack of cohesion and common policies,\" the experts stressed. The only way to successfully solve this problem is to take responsibility for this crisis. \" A similar view was expressed by the president of the European Commission, Ursula von draen. \" Banning the flow of people is not the most effective way for Colorado virus. EU countries must take corresponding measures, \"she said.\nYash Muk, an expert on democracy and democracy at Johns Hopkins University, pointed out that although people in the opposition may use the spread of the virus to achieve their goals, For those already in power, the crisis could be a severe test.\n\"You can have a government that is divorced from reality until you have a serious crisis,\" he saiAbout \"But in the face of a global pandemic, boasting and denying reality will be a crisis of trust for the people.\"\nMigrants and refugees\nSo far, the biggest outbreaks have been in prosperous and relatively stable countries - China, Iran, Japan, Italy and South Korea. Each of them has a strong central government and organized medical services. However, in countries with less developed health systems, the virus is not only difficult to control, but also difficult to detect. This applies to a number of African countries as well as to war zones in Syria, Libya and Yemen.\nAnother major problem is the large number of refugees in Europe and the Middle East. In fact, these people are excluded from any social security. They live in crowded refugee camps with poor sanitation. This makes them most vulnerable to the epidemic. Millions of displaced people are scattered in Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey, Syria and Iran. Against this background, the Turkish government's decision not to stop the flow of refugees to Europe will only attract more attention. The uncontrolled flow of people without access to basic medical services only exacerbates the spread of the diseaseAbout\nImpact on China\nUnlike in the west, civil liberties are still a sensitive topic for the government, and China is not afraid to take severe measures to control the disease. About 150 million people in the country are not free to leave their homes. The authorities have successfully established one of the largest quarantine systems in the world. Although Beijing has achieved some success in the prevention and control of coronavirus, the political and economic impact of the Chinese people's infection remains to be estimated.\nIn general, society seems to be in line with a country's actions, which are more like a natural disaster. But the strong reaction of social networks to the death of Li Wenliang's young doctor in Wuhan proves that the Chinese people can also hold the authorities accountable at any time.\nAnother area, the Hong Kong rebellion, remains a problem for Beijing. The virus reduced street activity, but further worsened the relationship between protesters and local authorities. The administration in the region has been taking preventive measures for too long. Despite a large number of Chinese citizens, the news about Colorado has long been of secondary importance. The border with mainland China was closed only after protesters demanded it in February. These speeches are even supported by the ruling party. SARS killed 299 people in 2003About In Hong Kong's parliamentary election in September 2020, the government's hesitation and pessimism of protesters will inevitably be affected.\nLast week, coronaveros officially acknowledged the global crisis. Experts hope that this will change with hot weather or the discovery of vaccines. Serious consequences for the well-being of mankind as a whole are likely to be avoidable.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "COVID-19继续在全球范围内传播。各部委的工作人员、第一批人的周围环境、甚至其家庭成员都证实了这些疾病。\n艾滋病毒/艾滋病的蔓延已经对全球局势，特别是经济产生了严重影响。各国的紧急状况，再加上全球经济衰退，不可能不影响整个世界的政策。这不仅是因为官员也感染了同样的感染，被隔离和取消访问和会议。这一流行病可能阻碍全球政治进程，并引发新的危机。\n美国选举\n起初，美国总统说，科罗拉多州的局势完全控制，并呼吁美国人购买证券。但是，随着疾病发病率的上升，白宫的乐观与现实没有关系。\n起初，tramp说服国家，美国准备对抗COVID-19。然而，当感染人数达到数千，总统不得不宣布紧急状态。跳板命令取消从欧盟的航班引起了更多的批评，特别是在布鲁塞尔。欧盟感到愤慨的是，总统在没有任何警告的情况下作出了这一决定♪♪这再次表明了欧盟和美国之间的冷淡的关系。然而，最初的《跳板限制飞行令》并未涉及英国，因为英国是卫生部副部长找到科罗纳维罗斯的国家。虽然后来对王国采取了措施。\n上星期，海洋培训方案与巴西代表团举行了会议，并与巴西官员法比奥·瓦因加滕在一起。很快，他们在最后一个找到了Coronavirus。尽管如此，美国总统和他的副手迈克彭斯并没有按照建议的要求去检疫。海洋事务和海洋法司只限于进行一次显示出不利结果的试验。同时，参议员林赛·格雷厄姆也会见了巴西代表团的成员，决定单独监禁。\n发病率上升的情况是我们在台普总统任期内面临的最大挑战之一。同时，这些测试是在美国竞选的高潮。总统的愚蠢的决定可能会让他在即将到来的投票。尤其是民主党人从跳台上拦截了科罗拉多病毒倡议。上周，在选举中可能的竞选对手乔拜登提出了他的国家摆脱危机的计划。同时在众议院的民主党人通过了一项特别协♪♪此外，这一流行病是对整个美国卫生系统的挑战。在病毒传播的背景下，参议员伯尼·桑德斯的承诺可以给选民带来新的声音。然而，拜登和桑德斯出于公共安全的考虑，都被迫取消一些集会。\n申根危机\n意大利是欧洲病毒传播的主要来源之一。罗马决定关闭全国隔离和隔离人口——6 000万人——立即引起邻国的反应。奥地利，斯洛文尼亚，匈牙利和瑞士加强了对意大利边境的控制，检查旅行者的健康状况，要求医疗证明。旅行和交通受到限制。自3月16日以来，德国关闭了与奥地利、丹麦、法国和瑞士的边界。该病毒实际上已经消除了欧洲自由行动区。\n欧盟委员会和欧盟边防局Frontex证实，他们的工作人员中已经有感染者。如果疾病在欧盟的蔓延继续恶化，有可能关闭整个欧盟的边界。在所有的社区国家，已记录到了冠状病毒的病例。这场危机再次表明欧洲团结的脆弱性和欧盟不能采取一致行动♪♪这一病毒的传播迫使各国自行选择战略。”新的移徙危机加剧了这一局势，同时在欧盟外部边界上蔓延。\n伦敦经济学院教授玛丽娜·奇诺·帕格利阿雷洛指出，欧元区正经历两大问题的汇合：“健康和移民，他们是相互重叠的。”在欧洲，缺乏信任和团结。”\n“欧洲正在为缺乏凝聚力和共同政策付出代价”，专家强调。要成功地解决这一问题，唯一的办法是承担这场危机的责任。”欧洲联盟委员会主席乌苏拉·冯德莱恩也表达了类似的观点。”禁止人员流动并不是科罗拉多病毒的最有效手段。欧盟国家必须采取相应的措施，”她说。\n约翰·霍普金斯大学民主和民主制专家亚什·穆克指出，虽然反对派的民众可能利用病毒的传播来达到其目的，对于那些已经掌权的民众来说，危机可能是一个严峻的考验。\n他说：“你可以有一个脱离现实的政府，直到你遇到严重的危机。♪♪“但是，面对全球大流行病，夸耀和否认现实将是民众面临的信任危机。”\n移民和难民\n迄今为止，最大的爆发主要发生在繁荣和相对稳定的国家——中国、伊朗、日本、意大利和韩国。他们每个人都有强大的中央政府和有组织的医疗服务。但是，在保健系统较不发达的国家，病毒不仅难以控制，而且也难以检测。这适用于一些非洲国家以及叙利亚、利比亚和也门的战争地区。\n另一个重大问题是欧洲和中东的大量难民。事实上，这些人被排除在任何社会保障之外。他们生活在拥挤的难民营里，卫生条件差。这使他们最容易受到这一流行病的伤害。数百万流离失所者分散在伊拉克、黎巴嫩、土耳其、叙利亚和伊朗。在这种背景下，土耳其政府决定不阻止难民向欧洲流动，这一决定只会引起更多的关注。无法获得基本医疗服务的人无节制地流动只会加剧疾病的蔓延♪♪\n对中国的影响\n与西方国家不同，在西方国家，公民的自由仍然是政府的一个敏感话题，中国并不害怕采取严厉的措施来控制疾病。该国约有1.5亿人不能自由离开家园。当局成功地建立了世界上最大的检疫制度之一。尽管北京在防治冠状病毒方面取得了一定的成功，但中国群众感染所产生的政治、经济影响仍有待估计。\n总的来说，社会似乎与一个国家的行动是一致的，而这个国家的行动更像是一个自然灾害。但社交网络对武汉李文良的年轻医生的死亡的强烈反应证明，中国人民也可以随时追究当局的责任。\n另一个地区，香港叛乱，仍然是北京的问题。该病毒减少了街头活动，但进一步恶化了抗议者与地方当局的关系。该地区的行政当局采取预防措施的时间太长了。尽管有大量来自中国的公民，但关于科罗拉多州的新闻长期处于次要地位。只有在2月份抗议者提出要求后，才关闭与中国大陆的边境。这些讲话甚至得到执政党的支持。2003年的非典使299人丧生♪♪在2020年9月的香港议会选举中，政府的犹豫不决和悲观的抗议者情绪必然会受到影响。\n上星期，科罗纳维罗斯正式承认全球危机。专家们希望，这种情况将随着炎热的天气或疫苗的发现而改变。对全人类福祉的严重后果很可能是可以避免的。但这一流行病的政治影响似乎刚刚开始。\n德米特里·别利亚耶",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The Trump administration cut staff by more than two-thirds at a key U.S. public health agency operating inside China, as part of a larger rollback of U.S.-funded health and science experts on the ground there leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters has learned.\nMost of the reductions were made at the Beijing office of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and occurred over the past two years, according to public CDC documents viewed by Reuters and interviews with four people familiar with the drawdown.\nThe Atlanta-based CDC, America’s preeminent disease fighting agency, provides public health assistance to nations around the world and works with them to help stop outbreaks of contagious diseases from spreading globally. It has worked in China for 30 years.\nThe CDC’s China headcount has shrunk to around 14 staffers, down from approximately 47 people since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, the documents show. The four people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the losses included epidemiologists and other health professionals.\nThe material  reviewed by Reuters shows a breakdown of how many American and local Chinese employees were assigned there. The documents are the CDC’s own descriptions of its headcount, which it posts online. Reuters was able to search past copies of the material to confirm the decline described by the four people.\n“The CDC office in Beijing is a shell of its former self,” said one of the people, a U.S. official who worked in China at the time of the drawdown.\nSeparately, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the global relief program which had a role in helping China monitor and respond to outbreaks, also shut their Beijing offices on Trump’s watch. Before the closures, each office was staffed by a U.S. official. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture(USDA) transferred out of China in 2018 the manager of an animal disease monitoring program.\nReductions at the U.S. agencies sidelined health experts, scientists and other professionals who might have been able to help China mount an earlier response to the novel coronavirus, as well as provide the U.S. government with more information about what was coming, according to the people who spoke with Reuters. The Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and for keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to assist.\n“We had a large operation of experts in China who were brought back during this administration, some of them months before the outbreak,” said one of the people who witnessed the withdrawal of U.S. personnel. “You have to consider the possibility that our drawdown made this catastrophe more likely or more difficult to respond to.”\nThe White House declined to comment or respond to questions from Reuters regarding the U.S withdrawal of staff in China.\nThe CDC did not respond to detailed questions submitted by Reuters about the cuts. It has insisted its staffing levels did not hinder the U.S. response to the coronavirus.\n“There are many factors that go into decisions around staffing,” the CDC said in a statement.\nSome health experts were skeptical that more CDC employees operating inside China would have made a difference in stemming the outbreak. Beijing has been widely criticized for silencing its own public health officials who warned of a deadly new respiratory disease emanating from the Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.\n“The problem was China, not that we didn’t have CDC people in China,” said Scott McNabb, a former CDC epidemiologist who is now a research professor with Emory University. He pointed to China’s censorship as the main culprit in the spread of the pandemic, which has infected at least 435,470 people worldwide, killed 19,598 and upended the global economy.\nChina’s embassy in Washington, D.C. declined to comment.\nThe NSF closed all foreign offices in 2018, according to spokesman Robert Margetta. He said the agency planned on “sending teams on short-term expeditions around the world to find ways to increase international collaborations.”\nA USAID spokesman said the decision to shutter its Beijing office was “due to significantly decreased access to Chinese government officials as well as the Agency’s position that the Chinese model of development is not aligned with U.S. values and interests.”\nThe USDA confirmed that it moved a manager position out of Beijing. A spokesman said the department has retained an office in China that employs eight people: five Americans and three Chinese. The office monitors animal disease and helps resolve “trade-related issues as they occur at Chinese ports of entry,” the spokesman said.\nReuters first reported about changes to CDC staffing in China on Sunday. The news agency revealed that the Trump administration had eliminated the position of a U.S. trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists, who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.\nIn a press briefing on Sunday, Trump criticized the Reuters story as “100 percent wrong.” Yet the CDC acknowledged the position had been cut. The agency said the decision was made because of China’s “excellent technical capability,” and said the elimination of that post did not hamper the U.S. effort to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe CDC staffing documents newly reviewed by Reuters show a sharp decline in the overall number of employees at the agency in Beijing, with 33 out of 47 positions lost.\nThe documents show the breakdown between American and Chinese staffers. The number of so-called American “assignees” declined to three positions from eight at the outset of the administration. Positions lost included medical epidemiologists and other experts in infectious diseases.\nThe biggest cuts were to positions filled by Chinese employees on the U.S. payroll, down to around 10 from 40 over the same period. Many of those local hires included medical and disease experts, according to the people who spoke with Reuters.\n“Local staffers stayed even longer at the CDC and had a real depth of knowledge,” one of the people said. “There’s a loss of deep expertise and institutional knowledge.”\nThe CDC told Reuters the three Americans currently on staff in China are a country director, an influenza expert and an information technology expert. A temporary deputy director arrived recently, and that job will be filled permanently, the agency said in a statement. In addition, two Chinese staffers continue to work on specific public health areas, including the training program, according to the statement.\nThe shuttered USAID and NSF offices in China also had a role in building scientific relationships and combating global disease, according to the four people familiar with the situation.\nUSAID’s Beijing office, which was staffed by a senior U.S. officer and two Chinese employees, was working on initiatives including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria, the people said. The office closed in 2019.\nThe NSF office was once led by Nancy Sung, a respected American scientist who was a key link between the U.S. and Chinese scientific communities, according to the U.S. government official who spoke with Reuters. The office also employed two local staffers.\n“She had far more contacts than most of us,” said the official, who had been in China at the time and was familiar with her role. “She could have helped maintain vital channels of communication between the two countries which to this day is greatly curtailed.”\nSung, who is now with the NSF in the United States, declined to comment about the closure of her office in 2018 and referred questions to the agency’s public affairs office.\nThe changes came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Beijing. Trump has long complained that China has stolen millions of American jobs and intellectual property, charges the Chinese government has rejected as baseless. The countries have slapped billions in tariffs on each other’s goods. Now their leaders are battling to control the narrative over the pandemic. Trump has called it the “Chinese virus” to keep the focus on China’s role in unleashing the pandemic. China, meanwhile, is trying to assert global leadership by providing aid to Italy and other hard-hit countries.\nOver the last two years, the White House has pushed U.S. agencies with a presence in China to de-fund programs there along with the positions to manage them, according to the U.S. official who spoke to Reuters.\nThe source said Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former Republican governor of Iowa, tried to remind the White House of the importance of the U.S. presence in China but was told to “get with the program” by an administration official.\n“The White House saw the relationship as one-sided and without benefit to the U.S.,” the source said.\nA State Department spokesman said in a statement that the U.S. Embassy in China is “one of our largest, reflecting the many areas of bilateral engagement.”\n“Since Ambassador Branstad’s arrival, the U.S. Mission to China has maintained robust staffing to advance important foreign policy goals on behalf of the American people,” the statement said. “Staffing levels for the numerous federal agencies and sections have, on the whole, held steady and in some cases increased.”\nAfter Reuters’ story about the elimination of the key CDC position in China ran on Sunday, Trump’s re-election campaign seized on it for fundraising. In a mass email to supporters, it accused Trump’s critics of “siding with the Chinese” and helping Beijing with a “cover-up.”\nThe CDC on Monday told Reuters that Redfield had decided to add a global health threats program director to its China staff.\n“At the request of Dr. Redfield, CDC is continuing to look long term at possible additions to enhance CDC’s 30 plus year presence in China,” the statement said.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "华盛顿（路透社）-路透社获悉，特朗普政府将在中国境内运营的一家美国重要公共卫生机构的工作人员裁减了三分之二以上，这是美国资助的卫生和科学专家在中国当地导致冠状病毒爆发的更大规模回退的一部分。\n根据路透社查阅的美国疾病预防控制中心（CDC）北京办事处的公开文件以及对4名知情人士的采访，大部分削减是在过去两年内进行的。\n总部位于亚特兰大的疾病预防控制中心是美国最杰出的疾病防治机构，它向世界各国提供公共卫生援助，并与它们合作，帮助阻止传染病的爆发在全球蔓延。它在中国已经工作了30年。\n文件显示，自2017年1月唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）总统上任以来，中国疾控中心在华员工人数已从约47人缩减至约14人。这4名不愿透露姓名的人士说，这些损失包括流行病学家和其他卫生专业人员。\n路透社审查的材料显示，有多少美国和当地的中国雇员被分配到那里。这些文件是疾控中心自己对其员工数量的描述，并在网上发布。路透社能够搜索过去的材料副本，以证实这四人所描述的下降。\n其中一位在中国工作的美国官员说：“疾控中心驻北京办事处是它以前的一个外壳。”。\n另外，美国国家科学基金会（NSF）和美国国际开发署（USAID）在帮助中国监测和应对疫情方面发挥作用的全球救援计划也关闭了在特朗普监督下的北京办事处。在关闭之前，每个办公室都有一名美国官. 此外，美国农业部（USDA）在2018年将一个动物疾病监测项目的经理调离中国。\n据接受路透社采访的人士说，美国机构的削减使那些本可以帮助中国更早对新型冠状病毒做出反应的健康专家、科学家和其他专业人士受到排挤，同时也为美国政府提供了更多有关未来的信息。特朗普政府今年2月谴责中国审查有关疫情的信息，并阻止美国专家入境协助。\n一位目睹美军人员撤离的人士说：“我们在中国有一大批专家在本届政府期间被带回来，其中一些是在疫情爆发前几个月带回来的。”。“你必须考虑我们的撤军可能使这场灾难更可能或更难以应对。”\n白宫拒绝对路透社有关美国撤走在华工作人员的问题发表评论或作出回应。\n疾控中心没有回应路透社提出的有关削减开支的详细问题。它坚称，其人员配备水平并不妨碍美国对冠状病毒的反应。\n疾病预防控制中心在一份声明中说：“在决定人员配备时，有很多因素。\n一些卫生专家怀疑，更多在中国境内工作的疾控中心员工会对遏制疫情产生影响。北京因压制自己的公共卫生官员而受到广泛批评，这些官员警告说，一种致命的新呼吸道疾病来自中国武汉市和湖北省周边地区。\n“问题是中国，而不是我们没有疾病控制中心的人在中国，”斯科特麦克纳布说，他以前是疾病控制中心的流行病学家，现在是埃默里大学的研究教. 他指出，中国的审查制度是这一流行病蔓延的罪魁祸首，全球至少有435470人感染了这一流行病，19598人死亡，并颠覆了全球经济。\n中国驻华盛顿大使馆拒绝置评。\n据发言人罗伯特·马格塔（Robert Margetta）说，国家安全基金会在2018年关闭了所有外交办事处。他说，该机构计划“派遣团队在世界各地进行短期考察，以寻找增加国际合作的途径。”\n美国国际开发署发言人说，关闭北京办事处的决定“是因为与中国政府官员接触的机会大大减少，以及该机构的立场，即中国的发展模式与美国的价值观和利益不符”\n美国农业部证实，已将一个经理职位调离北京。一位发言人说，该部门在中国保留了一个办公室，共有八名员工：五名美国人和三名中国人。该发言人说，该办公室负责监测动物疾病，并帮助解决“中国入境口岸发生的与贸易有关的问题”。\n路透社周日首次报道了中国疾控中心人员配置的变化。这家通讯社透露，特朗普政府已经取消了一名中国野战流行病学家的美国培训师的职位，他们被部署到爆发的震中，帮助追踪、调查和控制疾病。\n在周日的新闻发布会上，特朗普批评路透社的报道是“100%错误的”。然而疾控中心承认这一立场已经被削减。该机构说，做出这一决定是因为中国的“卓越技术能力”，并说，取消这一职位并不妨碍美国应对冠状病毒疫情的努力。\n路透社最新审查的中国疾控中心人员配置文件显示，该机构在北京的员工总数急剧下降，47个职位中有33个职位流失。\n这些文件显示了美中两国员工之间的分. 所谓的美国“被派遣者”从政府成立之初的8人减少到3人。失去的职位包括医学流行病学家和其他传染病专家。\n削减幅度最大的是美国薪资中由中国员工填补的职位，从同期的40个减少到10个左右。据接受路透社采访的人士说，许多当地雇员包括医疗和疾病专家。\n其中一位知情人士说：“当地的工作人员在疾控中心呆的时间甚至更长，知识也非常渊博。”。“缺乏深厚的专业知识和机构知识。”\n疾控中心告诉路透社，目前在华工作的三名美国人分别是国家主任、流感专家和信息技术专家。该机构在一份声明中说，一名临时副局长最近抵达，这一职位将被永久填补。此外，根据声明，两名中国工作人员继续在具体的公共卫生领域工作，包括培训项目。\n据四位知情人士透露，关闭的美国国际开发署（USAID）和美国国家科学基金会（NSF）驻华办事处在建立科学关系和抗击全球疾病方面也发挥了作用。\n知情人士说，美国国际开发署驻北京办事处由一名美国高级官员和两名中国雇员组成，正在制定包括耐多药结核病和疟疾在内的举措。办公室于2019年关闭。\n接受路透社采访的美国政府官员称，NSF办公室曾由备受尊敬的美国科学家南希·宋（Nancy Sung）领导，她是美国和中国科学界之间的关键纽带。该办公室还雇用了两名当地工作人员。\n这位官员说：“她和我们大多数人的接触都要多得多，”她当时在中国，对自己的角色很熟悉。“她本可以帮助保持两国间重要的沟通渠道，但到今天为止，这一渠道已大大减.”\n目前在美国国家科学基金会任职的宋美龄拒绝就其办公室在2018年关闭发表评论，并将问题提交给该机构的公共事务办公室。\n这些变化是在华盛顿和北京之间的紧张局势升级之际发生的。长期以来，特朗普一直抱怨中国窃取了数以百万计的美国工作和知识产权，中国政府拒绝的指控是毫无根据的。这些国家对彼此的商品征收了数十亿的关税。现在，他们的领导人正在努力控制对大流行的叙述。特朗普称之为“中国病毒”，以关注中国在引发这场流行病方面的作用。与此同时，中国正试图通过向意大利和其他遭受重创的国家提供援助来维护全球领导地位。\n据这位接受路透社采访的美国官员说，在过去两年里，白宫一直在推动在华驻扎的美国机构取消在华项目的资金来源，同时取消管理这些项目的职位。\n消息人士说，美国驻华大使、爱荷华州前共和党州长特里·布兰斯塔德（Terry Branstad）试图提醒白宫，美国在中国的存在很重要，但被一名政府官员告知“执行该计划”。\n这位消息人士说：“白宫认为中美关系是片面的，对美国没有好处。”。\n美国国务院发言人在一份声明中说，美国驻华大使馆是“我们最大的大使馆之一，反映了双边接触的许多领域”\n声明说：“自从布兰斯塔德大使抵达中国以来，美国驻华代表团一直保持强有力的人员配置，代表美国人民推进重要的外交政策目标。”。“许多联邦机构和部门的人员编制总体上保持稳定，在某些情况下有所增加。”\n路透社周日报道取消中国疾病预防控制中心的关键职位后，特朗普的连任竞选团队抓住了这个机会进行筹. 在给支持者的大量电子邮件中，它指责特朗普的批评者“站在中国一边”，帮助北京“掩盖事实”\n疾控中心周一对路透社表示，雷德菲尔德已决定在其中国员工中增加一名全球健康威胁项目主管。\n声明说：“应雷德菲尔德博士的要求，中国疾控中心将继续长期研究可能增加的项目，以增强中国疾控中心30多年的业务。”",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China is withdrawing the press credentials of American journalists at three U.S. newspapers, intensifying a bitter fight between the world’s top two economies that has widened to include the coronavirus outbreak and media freedoms.\nBeijing announced on Wednesday what it said was retaliation against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists that includes revoking the accreditations of American correspondents with the New York Times (NYT.N), News Corp’s (NWSA.O) Wall Street Journal and Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.\nThe move is a sharp escalation of a dispute that saw Washington last month force Chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies.\nBeijing then expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the “real sick man of Asia.”\nWashington then slashed the number of journalists permitted to work in the United States at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. It cited a “deepening crackdown” on independent reporting inside China.\nBeijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. It said they must hand back their press cards within 10 days.\nThe expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which said it “deplores” China’s decision.\nChina’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment on how many journalists are affected.\nBeijing also said the China branches of the three papers plus the Voice of America broadcaster and Time magazine must “declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.”\nThe latest development follows a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes a highly contagious, sometimes fatal, respiratory illness COVID-19.\nThe virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people globally, bringing normal life in many parts of the world to a standstill.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Beijing’s move on Wednesday would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in “incredibly challenging” times brought about by the coronavirus.\n“I regret China’s decision today to further foreclose the world’s ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people,” he said. “This is unfortunate... I hope they’ll reconsider.”\nMedia executives denounced the move.\n“We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U.S. reporters,” Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron said in a statement. “The Chinese government’s decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to COVID-19 is essential.”\nDean Baquet, executive editor at The New York Times, also condemned the decision.\n“It is a grave mistake for China to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world’s top news organizations,” he said.\nMatt Murray, editor in chief at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, said: “We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world. Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.”\nTime Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal said: “We oppose any effort by the Chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world.”\nA representative of Voice of America was not immediately reachable.\nA striking aspect of Beijing’s move was its decision to bar the journalists from working in Hong Kong and Macau, two semi-autonomous territories of China with their own media accreditation rules. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.\nThat raised questions about Hong Kong’s autonomy under the “one country, two systems” agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland.\n“There’s no precedent for China dictating who can and can’t report from Hong Kong openly,” said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists’ Asia program coordinator. “It very seriously erodes Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedom of the press.”\nThe Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in Hong Kong.\nIt said Hong Kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in Hong Kong and those applying to work in the city will continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the Chinese government.\nBeijing said on Wednesday that its actions “are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States.”\nPompeo said he did not think Beijing’s latest move was a balanced response. “This isn’t apples to apples,” he said, charging that the Chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of “propaganda outlets.”\nChina has repeatedly denounced the Wall Street Journal’s “sick man” column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologize, revoked the visas of the three reporters in Beijing. Another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after China declined to renew his visa.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese scientists and health experts involved in the country’s fight against the coronavirus believe the worst is now over, downplaying warnings that the disease could become seasonal or that a deadlier “second wave” could hit later in the year.\nAs the pandemic continues to spread overseas, a growing number of countries are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which COVID-19 remains in circulation until next year at the earliest.\nBut medical advisers in China have expressed confidence that the country’s strict containment measures have done enough to ensure that the outbreak can be brought under complete control, domestically at least, within weeks.\nThough they remain wary of the risks of “importing” cases from overseas, they say China should be capable of eliminating COVID-19 in the same way it eliminated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. SARS was eventually contained after the government imposed stringent screening and quarantine measures.\n“For me, a second outbreak (of coronavirus), a domestic outbreak in China, wouldn’t be a great concern,” said Cao Wei, deputy director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital.\nShe told a briefing on Monday that while China needed another month to make a final judgment, the existing prevention and control measures should be enough to bring the epidemic to an end domestically.\nThe World Health Organization has said the coronavirus reached a peak in China around late February. Zhong Nanshan, a senior government adviser who helped detect and defeat SARS in 2003, said it “could be over by June” if other countries take the required action.\nOn Wednesday, there were no new domestic cases in the disease’s epicenter of Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began. However, “imported” infections reached a record 34, and have outnumbered domestic transmissions for five consecutive days.\nIan Henderson, director of the Institute for Molecular Bioscience at the University of Queensland, said China’s actions to contain the virus have been “extraordinary” but there could be a second outbreak, this time imported.\n“(What) remains possible is that as controls around isolation are relaxed in China, with a population that is still susceptible, then the virus may resurge if it has not been eradicated elsewhere,” he said.\nGao Zhengliang, vice-director of the China Cell Biology Institute told the official Youth Daily newspaper that the country had now completed “99 out of 100 steps” required to defeat the coronavirus, though he warned that if global infections spiraled out of control, “the costs and sacrifices China has made will be downgraded.”\nSome experts have referred to the infection patterns of the devastating 1918-19 influenza epidemic that killed more than 50 million people during three different waves, with the second the deadliest. However, Henderson said it was important to recognize the current virus was different from influenza.\nGlobal inter-connectedness means that instead of coming in waves, new viruses are now more likely to spread and circulate until they mutate or until a certain level of immunity is reached. One crucial issue is how long a previously infected patient remains immune.\n“The number one point to get across is that in terms of the behavior of this virus we are still very much in the dark,” Henderson said. “The issue around protective immunity is difficult to answer because we simply do not have sufficient information.”\nSome experts have raised the possibility that COVID-19 could become an entrenched seasonal illness along with ordinary influenza.\nPreliminary studies have shown a possible correlation between the epidemic and climate patterns. A paper produced by researchers in Europe this week said the coronavirus preferred cool and dry conditions which could lead to seasonal global outbreaks “much like other respiratory diseases”.\nHowever, there have still been cases in warmer and more humid climates in southeast Asian countries, including Thailand and Singapore.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has been one of many to suggest that COVID-19 could go away of its own accord as temperatures rise in the northern hemisphere.\nHowever, Marc Lipsitch, a communicable disease expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said while warmer and wetter weather could reduce the contagiousness of the coronavirus, “it is not reasonable to expect those declines alone to slow transmission enough to make a big dent.”\nGao of the China Cell Biology Institute said given the higher fatality rate for the coronavirus, relaxing curbs was not an option.\n“The resolute curbs on the coronavirus must be continued, it absolutely cannot be allowed to co-exist with humans in the same way as the influenza virus.”\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has a significant deficit in hospital beds, medical staff and intensive care facilities as health experts warn that it is primed to become a new epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data reviewed by Reuters.\nHealth experts say Indonesia faces a surge in coronavirus cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak in the world’s fourth most populous country.\nIndonesia has recorded 686 cases but the data is seen as understating the scale of infections because of a low rate of testing and a high mortality rate. Indonesia has reported 55 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia.\nA study by the London-based Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases released on Monday estimates that as few as 2% of Indonesia’s coronavirus infections have been reported. That would bring the true number to as many as 34,300, which is more than Iran.\nOther modellers are projecting that cases could rise to as many as 5 million in the capital, Jakarta, by the end of April under a worst-case scenario.\n“We have lost control, it has already spread everywhere,” Ascobat Gani, a public health economist told Reuters. “Maybe we will follow Wuhan or Italy. I think we are in the range of that”.\nThe government says the impact of the virus will not be that severe.\n“We won’t be like that,” said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, referring to comparisons with outbreaks in Italy and China.\n“What’s important is that we rally the people ... they have to keep their distance.”\nIndonesia’s health system compares poorly with those in other countries hit hard by the virus.\nThe country of more than 260 million people has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data. That is about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\nIn 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.\nYurianto said with proper social distancing measures there should not be a need for a large number of additional beds and that medical staffing was sufficient to tackle the virus.\nHowever, Budi Haryanto, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia, told Reuters: “The hospitals are not ready to support the potential cases. Treatment will be limited.”\nAlthough only hundreds of people have been hospitalised for coronavirus, doctors told Reuters the health system was already under strain. Many health staff lack protective equipment, with one doctor telling Reuters how she had to wear a raincoat because there were no coveralls available.\nIn a sign of poor infection controls in hospitals and clinics, eight doctors and one nurse have died from the  coronavirus, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association.\nIn Italy, where there have been 6,077 coronavirus deaths, 23 doctors have died.\nStaff at one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta had threatened not to come to work on Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment, another doctor told Reuters.\n“We bring our own masks, our own suits that may not be of standard quality,” the doctor told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n“My friends, one by one, catch the virus,” he said, holding back tears.\nThe government said this week it had sourced 175,000 new sets of protective equipment for medical staff that would be distributed across the country.\nA new emergency hospital has been opened in Jakarta with an eventual capacity to treat up to 24,000 patients. Doctors and medical staff have been promised bonuses and 500,000 rapid testing kits have arrived from China.\nIndonesia’s health system is highly decentralised, making it hard for the central government to coordinate its response across a sprawling archipelago of some 19,000 islands spanning 5,100 km.\nA lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds also worries experts, especially as the country enters peak dengue fever season, which adds to demand for the facilities.\n“If you are critically ill and you can get into ICU and get put on a ventilator, most people should survive,” said Archie Clements, a public health specialist from Perth’s Curtin University, referring to people infected with the coronavirus.\n“If you don’t get them into ICU and get them on a ventilator, then they will die.”\nA study in the Critical Care Medicine journal in January, which compared intensive care beds for adults in Asian countries using 2017 data, found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, among the lowest in the region.\n(This story corrects name of Budi Haryanto in paragraph 14)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.\nThe American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China’s disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.\n“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases.  As an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.\nSince then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.\nIn a statement to Reuters, the U.S. CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington’s ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.\n“CDC has had a 30-year partnership with China CDC and close collaboration,” the statement said. “We had the right staff to engage China and ability to provide technical assistance were it requested.”\nThe CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”\nOne disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.\n“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have had made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”\nAlex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS)said Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”\nRedfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.\n“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”\nDays later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.\nOn Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.\nRelations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China.\nThe decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.\n“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,”  the same expert said.\nThe CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move.  “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.\nThe U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. Coronavirus is not influenza, though it is a respiratory disease.\nThe CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.\nChina in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people. Nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.\nThomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”\nDr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.\nYet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.\n“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.\nIn 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist  and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.\nBut since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.\n“The message from the administration was, ‘Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "路透华盛顿3月22日电---路透获悉，在冠状病毒大流行开始前几个月，特朗普政府取消了美国在北京的一个重要公共卫生职位，该职位旨在帮助发现中国爆发的疾病。\n据四位知情人士透露，这位美国疾病专家是中国疾病控制机构的一名医学流行病学家，今年7月离职。新冠状病毒的首批病例可能早在11月就已经出现，随着病例的爆发，特朗普政府在2月就斥责中国审查有关疫情的信息，阻止美国专家进入中国提供帮助。\n2007年至2011年间，美国疾病预防控制中心（U.S.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention）资助了担任这一职务的华裔朱宝平（Bao Ping Zhu），他说：“看到这一幕令人心碎。“如果有人在场，全世界的公共卫生官员和政府可能会行动得更快。”\n朱和其他消息来源说，美国专家琳达·奎克博士是中国现场流行病学家的培训师，他们被派往疫情中心，帮助追踪、调查和控制疾病。他们说，作为美国疾控中心的一名员工，Quick处于一个理想的位置，可以成为美国和其他国家在冠状病毒爆发时的耳目，并可能在几周前提醒他们注意日益增长的威胁。\n据消息人士透露，在Quick于7月离开后，没有其他外国疾病专家参与领导该项目。朱镕基说，在与中国同行建立密切关系之后，一位嵌入式专家往往可以很早得到疫情爆发的消息。\n朱和其他消息来源说，Quick可以向美国提供实时信. 以及世界各地的其他官员在疫情爆发的头几周表示，中国政府严厉打击信息发布，并提供了错误的评估。\n消息人士说，在美国与中国激烈的贸易争端中，她得知自己在中国的联邦资助职位（官方称为美国现场流行病学培训项目驻中国顾问）将于9月停止工作，于是迅速离开。美国疾控中心说，他们于12月31日在中国武汉首次发现了一个来源不明的“27例肺炎病例群”。\n此后，这种被称为COVID-19的疾病在全球迅速蔓延，造成13600多人死亡，317000多人感染。这一流行病已经使包括意大利在内的一些国家的医疗体系不堪重负，并威胁到美国和其他地方的医疗体系。\n美国疾控中心在向路透社发表的一份声明中说，取消顾问职位并不妨碍华盛顿获取信息的能力，“与疾控中心没有更早了解中国的病例完全无关”\n该机构表示，其决定不设常驻顾问“早在去年夏天就开始了，这是因为中国的技术能力和项目的成熟。”\n中国疾控中心表示，已指派两名中国员工作为“导师”协助培训计划。该机构没有回答有关导师具体角色或专业知识的问题。\n声明说：“中国疾控中心与中国疾控中心建立了30年的合作关系，并进行了密切合作。”。“我们有合适的工作人员与中国接触，如果中国提出要求，我们有能力提供技术援助。”\n疾控中心不愿让仍在该机构工作的Quick发表评论。\n当被要求就中国对疫情的透明度和反应发表评论时，中国外交部援引路透社发言人耿爽周五的讲. 耿雁生说，中国“以公开、透明、负责任的方式，采取了最严格、最全面、最彻底的防控措施，及时向（世界卫生组织）和有关国家和地区通报了最新情况。”\n一位疾病专家对路透社表示，鉴于中国政府对信息的压制，他怀疑这位美国常驻顾问是否能够更早或更好地向特朗普政府获取信息。\n“最终，根据中国的情况，这可能不会有太大的改变，”斯科特·麦克纳布说，他是疾控中心的流行病学家，20年了，现在是埃默里大学的研究教授。“问题是中国人是如何处理的。应该改变的是，中国人应该早一点承认，而不是。”\n美国卫生与公众服务部（HHS）部长阿历克斯•阿扎尔（Alex Azar）上周五表示，根据雷德菲尔德与“中国同事”的谈话，他的机构在1月初得知了冠状病毒\n据一位不愿透露姓名的卫生部官员透露，雷德菲尔德从中国疾控中心主任高福博士那里得知，“这看起来是一种新型冠状病毒”。“雷德菲尔德医生总是和高医生说话，”这位官员说。\n卫生部和疾病预防控制中心没有让Azar或Redfield发表评论。\n朱镕基和其他消息人士说，美国领导人不应该依赖中国疾控中心主任发出警报和更新。他们说，总的来说，中国官员在最初几周低估了疫情的严重性，直到1月20日才承认有人与人之间传播的证据。\n疫情爆发后，中国实施了严格的隔离措施，特朗普政府官员抱怨说，中国审查了有关疫情的信息，美国无法让美国疾病专家入境帮助遏制疫情蔓延。\n阿扎尔2月2日对美国有线电视新闻网. 14日，他和疾控中心主任雷德菲尔德正式提出，将于1月6日派遣一支疾控中心小组进入中国，但仍未获得允许他们进入中国。卫生部监督疾病预防控制中心。\n阿扎尔说：“雷德菲尔德医生和我在1月6日至36天前提出了这个提议，6万例病例和1300例死亡。“我们提出让疾控中心的专家来帮助他们的中国同事弄清关键的科学问题，比如，这种疾病是如何传播的？严重程度如何？潜伏期是多少，会不会有无症状的传播？”\n几天后，世界卫生组织获得了派遣一个由两名美国专家组成的小组的许可。该队在2月16日至24日期间访问过。到那时，中国已经报告了75000多起病例。\n2月25日，疾病预防控制中心告诉美国公众准备在国内爆发疫情的第一天，美国国务卿蓬佩奥指责中国通过对医疗专业人员和媒体的“审查”不当处理疫情。\n此后，两国关系恶化，特朗普将冠状病毒贴上“中国病毒”的标签，中国人谴责这种说法是污名化的。上周，中国政府宣布，来自纽约时报、华盛顿邮报和华尔街日报三家美国新闻机构的美国人将被驱逐出中国。\n消息人士对路透表示，在决定取消Quick的工作之际，中国疾控中心在过去两年缩减了在华美国员工的数量。\n“我们已经撤回了许多公共卫生技术专家，”同一位专家说。\n不过，疾控中心反驳说，人员配备是一个问题，或其信息受到了这一行动的限制。“不是人员短缺限制了我们的能力，”它说。\n该机构说，美国疾控中心在北京的团队目前包括三名美国公民担任永久职务，另外一名美国人是临时的，约有10名中国公. 在美国人中，有一位是流感专家，对呼吸道疾病有专长。冠状病毒不是流感，尽管它是一种呼吸道疾病。\n疾控中心的小组，除了Quick，被安置在美国大使馆的设施。消息人士说，除了Quick之外，没有一名美国疾控中心的工作人员与中国的疾病控制机构有联系。\n近几周来，中国报告称，由于采取了严厉的遏制措施，包括对拥有6000万人口的湖北省实施封锁，新案件数量急剧下降。尽管如此，接受路透社采访的传染病专家说，美国可以利用像Quick这样的人在当地进行接触，特别是在第二波传染病的恐惧出现时。\n美国疾病预防控制中心（CDC）前主任托马斯弗里登（Thomas R.Frieden）说，如果美国常驻顾问仍在中国，“我们今天可能会更多地了解这种冠状病毒是如何传播的，以及什么最有效地阻止它。”\n医学流行病学家乔治康威博士（George Conway）知道得很快，曾在2012年至2015年期间担任驻地顾问。他说，由于美国卫生官员就中国是否应该为自己的培训项目出资展开长期争论，多年来，这一职位的资金一直很薄弱。\n然而，据知情人士透露，自2001年启动这项培训计划以来，它不仅加强了中国流行病学家在这一领域的队伍，而且还促进了两国公共卫生官员之间的合作关系。\n康威说：“我们作为有资格的外交官去那里，然后作为亲密的同事和朋友回国。\n2007年，疾病预防控制中心流行病学家、担任顾问职务时间最长的美国官员之一罗伯特·方丹博士因其作为外国人在帮助发现和调查不明原因的肺炎群方面的贡献，获得了中国对公共卫生杰出贡献的最高荣.\n但弗里登等人表示，自去年以来，特朗普政府与中国领导人之间日益紧张的关系显然损害了双方的合作。\n弗里登说：“政府发出的信息是，‘不要与中国合作，他们是我们的竞争对手’。\n白宫没有立即回应置评请求。（泰勒在华盛顿报道；托尼·门罗在北京撰稿",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - An old malaria treatment that has been tried with some success against the new coronavirus and was touted by U.S. President Donald Trump at a news briefing earlier on Thursday is in short supply as demand surges amid the fast-spreading outbreak.\nThe American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), which maintains a list of drugs in shortage independent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s list, added the generic malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to its list on Thursday. Four out of eight manufacturers of the drug are currently in shortage, it said.\nThe new coronavirus, which causes the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, emerged in December in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the world.\nThere are currently no vaccines or treatments approved for the disease, but researchers are studying existing treatments and working on experimental ones. At the moment, most patients can only receive supportive care.\nErin Fox, senior director of drug information at University of Utah Health, who maintains ASHP’s shortages list, said pharmacists are unable to get the drug or fill prescriptions in full.\nFox said that University of Utah’s 12 retail pharmacies are not filling prescriptions for prophylactic use, and are preserving their stocks for inpatient needs.\nThe FDA could not be reached for comment, but hydroxychloroquine is not currently on its drugs in shortage list.\nTrump called on U.S. health regulators to expedite potential therapies aimed at treating COVID-19, including hydroxychloroquine.\n“We’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,” Trump said of the malaria drug at a White House briefing.\nFox and the FDA have been watching for drug shortages that could be due to supply chain issues with manufacturing in China and India. But surging demand in recent weeks is the issue with the malaria drug, which can also treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, according to online pharmacy, Honeybee Health.\nIts co-Chief Executive Jessica Nouhavandi sent a letter to prescribers earlier this week, urging them to be aware of potential hoarding of the drug that could deprives those who really need it.\nOn Thursday, Nouhavandi said demand was its highest yet after Trump’s comments.\nJeff Bartone, who owns Hock’s Pharmacy in Vandalia, Ohio, said he purchased five bottles of hydroxychloroquine this morning, but within an hour the company that distributes it to his pharmacy had run out.\nHe said four backup prescription drug wholesalers were out of the drug as well.\nBartone said he does not typically stock large amounts of the drug because it is not widely prescribed.\nMylan NV (MYL.O) - one of the manufacturers ASHP said was in shortage - said it was ramping up production of the drug and expects to be in a position to begin supplying it more broadly in mid-April.\nIt said with the raw materials on hand it can make 50 million tablets to potentially treat more than 1.5 million patients.\nBayer AG (BAYGn.DE) said it would donate 3 million tablets of Resochin - a closely related drug known generically as chloroquine phosphate.

        "news_content_translate_en": "What is going to be the future of Covid-19 in India? For how long coronavirus will infect people here? How many people are going to fall sick with Covid-19 in India? And how many people may die of Covid-19 here? No one has a sure answer to these questions. Possibly because no one can have an answer to these questions. But in case you are curious there is an online tool created by a machine learning expert that shows the course Covid-19 pandemic may take in India. It is a simple tool, but one based on SEIR model that scientists and public health experts use to predict epidemic in a given region.\nThe tool has been created by Gabriel Goh, a machine learning researcher.\nThere is nothing official about the tool but during a time when the information from government experts may not be coming or coming fast enough it can shed some clarity on what Covid-19 can do to India. Depending on what measures the country takes, and what impact these measures have on Covid-19 infections in India, coronavirus may end up killing around 1000 people to 5 million people in India, according to the Epidemic Calculator. Why such gap between these two numbers?\nAccording to the Epidemic Calculator, it all depends on flattening the curve, bringing down R0 the rate at which infections spread and at what stage the lockdown was enforced and ordered.\nAt the time of writing, the coronavirus disease of 2019 remains a global health crisis of grave and uncertain magnitude. To the non-expert (such as myself), contextualizing the numbers, forecasts and epidemiological parameters described in the media and literature can be challenging. I created this calculator as an attempt to address this gap in understanding, notes Goh. This calculator implements a classical infectious disease model -- SEIR (Susceptible > Exposed > Infected > Removed) -- an idealized model of spread still used in frontlines of research.\nBy default the tool already has the relevant data, based on the research reports that have come out on Covid-19 from China and other countries so far, in the required fields. To see how Covid-19 will progress in India on the basis of this available data about coronavirus, and how it infects people, how many it kills, for how long it keeps people sick, all you need to do is change the population of the region to India’s population.\nHere are some projections this tool gives as far Covid-19 and its future progression in India is concerned:\nCovid-19 in India with default data\nWith default data, which considers the infection rate R0 of 2.2 it means a coronavirus patient is likely to infect at least two more people the coronavirus Epidemic Calculator indicates that in a year the disease will infect a little over 1 million people in India. Of these, it will kill little over 20,000 people. While you look at these numbers, there are a few important bits to remember.\n-- By default the Epidemic Calculator assumes that on the 100th day after the first reported case the government has forced the region or country into a full lockdown.\n-- The lockdown or intervention in some other way, brings down the R0 to less than 1. This is very important.\n-- If the lockdown or intervention has brought the R0 lower earlier, say just 50 days after the first case was reported, the total number of cases will be significantly less and number of fatalities exponentially lower.\n-- It is also important to remember that by default the Epidemic Calculator considers fatality rate for Covid-19 as 2 per cent. In China, it has been slightly more. In South Korea and Germany it is significantly less. In Italy and Spain, it is alarmingly high, particularly in Italy where it is above 8 per cent. If you consider other figures for India depending on which one you do the covid-19 picture will change.\nThe covid-19 case fatality rate for India is something neither experts nor Epidemic Calculator can predict. The global fatality rate for swine flu is less than 0.1 per cent. But in India, in the previous swine flu epidemics, the death rate has been close to 6 per cent. For Covid-19 only time will tell what is the fatality rate in India.\nCovid-19 in India a best case scenario\nSo, what is the best case scenario for covid-19 in India. If everything works well in India, if government mounts a good response, and death rate is not above 2 per cent, health care system holds up, quarantine is effective, then covid-19 may end up infecting a little above 15,000 people. This also takes into account the fact that in India the first case was detected on January 30 and the lockdown was ordered on March 24. Assuming that the coronavirus became infectious in India a few days before the first patient was detected, we can say that the country mounted effective response on around Day 65 of the disease. This can potentially limit number of Ccovid-19 cases in India to around 15,000 and deaths to around 300. Let's hope this is the case.\nCovid-19 in India worst case scenario\nNow, take the worst case scenario. This is the one where the data that we have so far from the government is not accurate, the quarantine is not effective, the health system is not ready and will not be able to hold up well, that the disease is spreading in India undetected for far longer even though the first case was only found on January 30. In this case, also assume that India’s poor health system will not be able to cope up with Covid-19 when cases start to rise and let’s move the case fatality rate to 4 per cent, which is still significantly lower than what Covid-19 is showing in Italy and Spain but is higher than the global rate. Let’s also assume that the quarantine doesn’t bring down the R0 much. May be a half per cent or so but not enough to flatten the curve in one year.\nIn this case, given that population of India is little over 1.3 billion, we may end up seeing around 180 million infected in the country this year and little over 5 million dead.\nThis is all projection\nIt’s important to note that Covid-19 epidemic calculator is a tool that creates projections on the basis of data you feed into it. And as far as Covid-19 and novel coronavirus are concerned, right now not enough data, and not accurate enough data, is available. Everything is an approximation. What is the real fatality rate of Covid-19? Different countries are showing different numbers and they are all over the place, with extremely huge gaps between them. How quickly and how widely this is R0 that Covid-19 spreads? Again, we don’t know the exact number. Some studies say it is 4. Some say it is 2. Some even say that it is 6.\nThen there are other unknowns. Can Covid-19 re-infect people who were sick with it and then got better? We don’t know for sure. Does temperature India is a very hot country and dry air summer is coming in parts of India affect this coronavirus? And if it does, how much? We don’t know for sure. There are many more factors, like real world conditions. How long Covid-19 patients take to recover? For how long they are infectious? For how long they have to be in a hospital? For how long a country can care for its ICU patients? These are the figures that government experts and policy makers probably know. An online epidemic calculator doesn’t. So if you are giving the online epidemic calculator created by Gabriel Goh a spin, keep this in mind.\n",

This included 3,277 people who died of the disease, 4,735 patients who were still being treated and 73,159 patients discharged after recovery, the NHC said on Tuesday.\nWhile the gradual opening of Hubei province will enable its over 56 million to emerge out of the strict lockdown which also effectively shielded the grim stories of their suffering, there are apprehensions highlighted in the Chinese official media about how they will be received in the rest of the country considering the stigmatisation of the areas with Covid-19 and its deadly nature of transmission.\nAs the virus emerged in Wuhan, several foreign countries, including India, has evacuated their nationals and subjected them to stringent quarantine procedures to ensure the virus is not spread back home.\nAlso as China appeared eager to reopen the country starting factories and business to make up for the lost time, Chinese experts warned of a possible second wave of the Covid-19 virus attack.\nThe total number of imported cases of the virus reached 427 on Tuesday as a large number of overseas Chinese especially in countries like Italy which have now emerged as the new Covid-19 epicentres arrived back home.\nLoopholes in screening processes at customs and inadequate quarantine measures upon entry into the Chinese cities as well as a high proportion of asymptomatic cases are making the second wave of novel coronavirus outbreak highly likely, even inevitable, as the global pandemic continues to worsen, state-run Global Times reported on Tuesday.\nAlthough a drop in new cases is reported on a daily basis, all new cases now are imported infections, sparking serious concerns over a looming second outbreak in China, it said.\nChina's epidemiologist Li Lanjuan told media here on Monday that China still faces a severe situation currently due to the surge in imported cases from other countries and regions.\n\"China is already facing the risk of a second outbreak as the number of imported cases already reached a small peak,\" Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told the Global Times.\nHowever, various Chinese medical experts believed that a second outbreak is unlikely, considering the country's stringent measures and experiences during the past two months in combating the disease.\n",

It plans to convert five more, and Madrid's hotel association has offered a total of 40 of its buildings to be used.\nThe city has also set up a field hospital in the Ifema trade fair complex, not far from the makeshift Ice Palace morgue.\nAs healthcare workers worked around the clock, they also struggled with scarce supplies.\n\"All over the country, you see examples of workers inventing homemade suits using plastics,\" Olga Mediano, a lung specialist at a hospital in Guadalajara, a city east of Madrid, told The Associated Press.\n\"The protective suits are fundamental because without health workers we won't be able to do anything.\"\nMore than 387,000 people worldwide have been infected by the new coronavirus and more than 16,700 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. But for some older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. More than 101,000 people have recovered, including more than 60,000 in China.\nTokyo Olympics likely to be postponed\nJapan's NHK television reported that Abe will propose a one-year postponement for the Tokyo Olympics during talks with IOC President Thomas Bach. Abe said a postponement is unavoidable if the 2020 Games cannot be held in a complete manner amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nAbe held telephone talks with Bach after the IOC said it would make a decision on the Tokyo Games over the next four weeks.\nIn Geneva, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris cited a \"glimmer of hope\" in hard-hit Italy after two days of slight declines in the number of new cases and deaths, while cautioning it's \"early days yet\" - and the trend needed to be monitored.\nChina to lift lockdown in Hubei\nIn another positive sign, Chinese authorities said they would finally end a two-month lockdown in hard-hit Hubei province where the coronavirus outbreak first began.\nStill, Harris said the scope of the global outbreak was \"enormous\" and that cases were expected to increase \"considerably.\"\n\"Just to put it in proportion: It took two years in the worst Ebola outbreak we ever had, the West African outbreak, to reach 11,000 deaths,\" Harris said.\nIn a sign of hope, Chinese authorities said they would finally end a two-month lockdown in hard-hit Hubei province where the coronavirus outbreak first began, while nations in Europe, North America and elsewhere pressed harder to enforce the stay-at-home restrictions placed on 1.5 billion people worldwide.\n530 deaths in US\nIn the US, the government was expected to pass a $2 trillion spending plan that would prop up businesses, which has been stalled for days.\nThere have been more than 46,000 infections and 530 deaths in the US as the virus continues to spread.\nIn New York, now one of the world's biggest virus hot spots, authorities rushed to set up the thousands of hospital beds they will need in just weeks to protect the city's 8.4 million people. The mayor warned that the city's hospitals are just 10 days away from shortages in basic supplies, while the state's governor announced plans to convert a New York City convention center into a hospital.\nIn Italy, Spain and France, the pandemic has already pushed national health systems to their breaking points.\nThe outbreak has killed more than 6,000 Italians, the highest death toll of any country. Officials said Monday the virus had claimed just over 600 more lives, down from 793 two days earlier.\nAmid the spiking numbers in Spain, relatives of elderly people and retirement homes' workers are expressing growing concern about the situation in retirement homes across Spain, especially in Madrid.\n\"We live in anguish, we have no information whatsoever,\" said Esther Navarro, whose 97-year-old mother with Alzheimer is at the Residencia Usera in Madrid where some of the cases have been identified.\nSpanish prosecutors are launching a judicial probe after Spanish army troops disinfecting elderly nursing homes discovered elderly people living among death bodies of those who had allegedly contracted the new coronavirus.\nConfusion in Britain\nConfusion rippled through Britain on the first morning after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a three-week halt to all nonessential activity. The government has told most stores to close, banned gatherings of three or more people and said everyone apart from essential workers should leave home only to buy food and medicines or to exercise. But photos showed crowded trains Tuesday on some London subway lines.\n\"I cannot say this more strongly: we must stop all non-essential use of public transport now,\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted. \"Ignoring these rules means more lives lost.\"\nAsian stock markets reacted positively Tuesday, markets in Japan and South Korea posting significant gains after the Federal Reserve said it will lend to small and large businesses and local governments to help them through the crisis.\nThe move toward lockdowns has been influenced by the success of such measures in China, where the virus was first found late last year in the central city of Wuhan. China barred people from leaving or entering the city on Jan. 23, and soon expanded that to cover most of Hubei province, home to 70 million people.\nOn Tuesday, after more than a week in which China said the vast majority of new virus cases were imported from abroad, authorities said the restrictions in Hubei would end. People cleared by health authorities would be able to leave the province after midnight. Wuhan itself will remain locked down until April 8.\nIn contrast to other European nations, German health authorities offered some hope that the country has flattened the exponential spread of the virus, which has already infected nearly 30,000.\nChancellor Angela Merkel's government approved a massive new aid package to cushion the economic fallout of the outbreak, offering more than 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) to tide small companies and entrepreneurs through closures and to pump capital into bigger companies.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Much has been said about the 'perils' of Work From Home during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Yes, it is unbearable, in all honesty. Everybody is so done with life and sorry for making it worse, but we are just in the second day of the 21-day nationwide lockdown in India. But let's get this straight. There is really no other option at the moment. However, we can tell you something that might cheer you up even in this grim period.\nYou've read about Survival Of The Fittest enough and it is time to implement it now. Why? Because we have to survive this pandemic without any sort of help. For those living alone, especially. It is taxing because there is literally no help. You need to fend for your food, clean the house and do other chores after completing your shift. On the flipside though, did you ever think about the amount of money that you are saving while cribbing about the lockdown?\nThe silver lining, thus, on this cloud, is that if not anything else, you will walk out of this pandemic with some extra bucks in your bank account once the corona conundrum is done with.\nFor the sake of your sanity (and ours as well), we curated this list that will help you ascertain a rough estimate of the amount of money you are saving at the moment.\nTake a look:\nNO ZOMATO, NO SWIGGY\nYes, this is the worst thing about the lockdown. Not being able to order food online. Basically, coronavirus has ensured that even in this distressing situation, you cannot afford to feel bad for yourself and soothe your soul with some biryani, pizza or tandoori chicken for that matter. You just have to make do with ready-to-eat jazz or better still, cook for yourself. But thanks to Zomato and Swiggy stalling operations, you cannot even believe the amount of money you are saving. Come on, you know it. Till then, enjoy simple home-cooked food and you can gorge on Swiggy and Zomato once we are done with the pandemic.\nNO ONLINE SHOPPING\nWe understand it's frustrating not being able to shop online considering some people actually keep a part of their earnings aside every month to do this. None of the e-commerce websites are delivering stuff but look at the brighter side of the story. You can use all the money that you had kept aside to shop tons of stuff once services resume. Think about the fact that you will not have to choose between the white shirt or that red lipstick - you can actually just buy both without batting an eyelid.\nNO CONVEYANCE EXPENSES\nCab aggregators Uber and Ola have suspended their services and public transport isn't available as well. Moreover, you are working from home and aren't even stepping out for recreation. So, no expenses for conveyance either. Make no mistake, because you are saving big time here.\nNO RECREATIONAL EXPENSES\nWhen was the last time you opened your wardrobe and wore a fancy dress for an outing? Well, the answer should explain that our only outing has been from the bedroom to the kitchen and vice-versa and that too, in our pyjamas. No partying with friends. No shopping at malls or indulging in delectable dishes at restaurants. Nothing, actually. Right now, it is all about you and your tanhai, and not to forget, kaafi saara paisa in the bank account.\nBEST USE OF RESOURCES\nIn order to avoid stepping out, it is ideal to make do with what you have. Everybody is basically making the best use of their resources, and although grocery stores are open, you are reconsidering heading out until absolutely necessary. With that, you are actually cutting out on a lot of unnecessary expenses. Do the math.\nSo, don't be surprised with your increased bank balance. Celebrate yourself, instead, for pulling off this major challenge with ultimate ease. But, hold on, only after we emerge victorious following the pandemic.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic has intensified rapidly across the world ever since it was reported in China's Wuhan in December 2019. India has recorded over 640 cases so far while the death toll is 16, as of March 26.\n",

On January 15, the US State Department notified Americans in China about the US Centre for Disease Control's warning against the coronavirus. \"And now blame China for Delay? Seriously,\" she said.\nChina, Hua tweeted, has treated COVID 19 as highly pathogenic virus according to the law on prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.\n\"As WHO stated, China identified the pathogen in a record short time and shared genetic sequence with the world, which helped others with epidemic response,\" she said.\nHowever, Ortagus denied her remarks.\n\"Nonsense.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Coronavirus outbreak has hit the economies hard, wiping out a major chunk of global wealth due to shutdowns, bans and investor concerns. India Today TV spoke to former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan to understand the extent of the possible impact of coronavirus outbreak on the Indian economy and what can be done to minimise the shock.\nExtent of economic shock \nThe extent of impact of novel coronavirus is the big unknown at the moment but it will be severe, Raghuram Rajan said. \"The extent of its impact is a big unknown right now. How long it will take to get it under control, how much GDP will be lost in the process, and how much can be recovered when the restrictive measures are taken off it is all unknown at the moment,\" Raghuram Rajan said.\nThe former RBI governor said that much depends on what happens next in China. \"With relaxations in place due to drop in the number of cases, everyone is looking at China to see if there are recurrences because if that happens then it means measures have to be in place longer and damages could be much larger,\" he said.\nThe economic expert said that the length of the coronavirus outbreak and recurrences could be the difference between depression and recession.\nFor now, China has lost around 10 per cent of its GDP in the first quarter and the projections for the United States and European countries say that they will end up losing a similar percentage of their GDP in the second quarter, he said.\nRaghuram Rajan, who is currently at the University of Chicago, said that one of the possible outcomes of the coronavirus outbreak could be the severe reduction in the global supply chains.\n\"It is a little early to say which direction it will take, of course, it is a huge unprecedented event. It could lead to countries being wary to having supply chains across the borders because they know they cant rely on them. But the other outcome is it can bring the world together knowing that we have to deal with such huge global challenges, may make us more aware that we need to deal with climate change,\" Raghuram Rajan told India Today TV's Rahul Kanwal.\nWhat can the Indian government do to minimise economic shock\nOrganise medical resources\nAccording to Raghuram Rajan, while saving larger business was crucial for the Indian economy, but the first priority for the government must be organising medical resources to fight the novel coronavirus.\n\"We need to prioritise. We must focus on buying ventilators, masks, getting protective equipment for our doctors and nurses so that they can do their jobs, and that means bringing every resource in whether it is private, public, retired, defence... get everything in on the act,\" he said.\n\"The government must gather all the resources and point them where they are needed the most. We need to find out where are the masks, where are the ventilators, where is the spare hospital capacity,\" Raghuram Rajan said.\nOn being asked about the absence of the global supply of medical resources, the ex-RBI chief said that Centre will have to use all the tricks in the book to acquire what is available in the international market.\n\"In the immediate context, we need to find the necessary supply wherever we can find, even if we have to cajole or push. Since every country is trying to do that, we need to use every way we can to apply pressure and bring-in all that we need,\" Raghuram Rajan said, adding that beyond the current scenario, the crisis raises the question on if we are self-sufficient for critical resources. \"But that's a medium-term issue,\" he said.\nIncome support for poor \nRaghuram Rajan said that the second most crucial thing for the government right now should be to ensure that money is put into the hands of the poor.\n\"The key is to make sure that the temporary shock does not become a more permanent shock. In other words, we must not have slow cash flows, no revenue, no income for workers, as that would lead to substantial lays offs, and that would lead to firms closing down and when the measures are withdrawn there will be a much less economic activity,\" he said.\nSuggesting a way out, the ex-RBI chief said that the government must build income bridges between now and the time when the restrictive measures will be lifted.\n\"We need bridges between now and then, for the most vulnerable households in India - for the poor, for migrants, we need ways to get money to them. But we also need to keep firms alive, firms which have suffered shock aftershock, we need to keep them from closing down, if they are viable. And that decision is a careful one because we can't keep every firm alive given that we have limited resources but we should keep the viable ones alive so that they can reopen, similarly for the large firms,\" he said.\nDismissing the idea that the Indian government should mull rolling out a universal minimum wage to solve the problem, the economic expert said that the government cannot be thinking about long-term measures at the moment.\n\"Temporary income support is possible but beyond that, we don't have the money. This is not the time to discuss universal basic income,\" he said.\nInfuse liquidity \nRaghuram Rajan said that the Indian financial system was an impaired financial system which was evident from the fact that the 'central bank is currently unable to provide credit support to businesses'.\n\"The government should provide partial guarantees to make sure banks continue lending to small and medium business enterprises and to large businesses, but we have to be careful as we have limited fiscal space so there has to be some incentive for the banks to also to take credit risk into account,\" Raghuram Rajan suggested.\nRajan said that the RBI should take a cue from the central banks across the world which are contributing to solving the problem by easing liquidity. \"Liquidity should not be a constraint, instead the central bank should be helping in credit,\" he said, adding that credit will have to distributed with caution so that India's staggering NPAs do not rise further.\nCommunicate clearly \nThe ex-RBI chief urged the Indian government to communicate with the public clearly that it is a national emergency. \"People must know that it is something that is affecting everyone,\" he said.\n\"If it has not happened to you right now, does not mean it won't happen to you tomorrow,\" Raghuram Rajan said, adding that the people must be encouraged to follow the protocol for the safety strictly.\nAdditionally, he asked the government to issue correct and detailed data of infections across the country so that timely interventions can be introduced.\n\"India needs to step up testing and do mass testing and release the data so that state governments can intervene and provide solutions,\" Raghuram Rajan said.\nAlert young crowd \nRaghuram Rajan said that the most common problem across the globe was that young people were not taking the problem seriously. They are assuming that they are not at risk, but they could be the carriers, he said.\n\"India must make sure that young people are alert and aware of the risks of possible transmission disease. Everyone must be encouraged to follow good hygiene habits to ensure the curb on the spread of the disease.\nParts of India go under lockdown\nThe central and state governments on Sunday announced lockdown in about 80 districts in the country where at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported.\nThe districts where lockdown was announced include 10 districts each in Maharashtra and Kerala, six districts each in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, five each in Karnataka and Haryana, three each in Tamil Nadu and Punjab.\nMeanwhile, S&P Global Ratings on Monday cut its estimate for India's GDP growth for the next fiscal to 5.2 per cent from its earlier estimate of 6.5 per cent, which further worsened the market sentiment that has been already reeling under the coronavirus spread.\nIn the global market, bourses in China, Hong Kong and South Korea plunged up to 5 per cent, while those in Japan ended on a positive note. Bourses in Europe sank up to 4 per cent.\nThe number of global Covid-19 infections has shot past 3,00,000. Worldwide fatalities topped 14,000. Cases in India spiked to 480 with at least nine deaths.\n",

This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

They have put the world at stake. I really don’t understand how can you eat bats, dogs, and cats. I’m really angry.\n\"The whole world is at risk now. The tourism industry has been hit, the economy is badly affected, and the whole world is going towards a lockdown,\" Akhtar said.\nPossibly fearing a backlash, Akhtar then went on to clarify that he was not against \"the people of China\" but the \"law of animals\".\n\"I’m not against the people of China but I’m against the law of animals. I understand this may be your culture but this is not benefitting you now, it is killing humanity. I’m not saying you boycott the Chinese but there has to be some law. You cannot go on an eat anything and everything,\" Akhtar added.\nAkhtar also seemed pretty disappointed by the empty stadiums currently serving as venues for Pakistan Super League matches, which arrived in the country for the 1st time since its inception.\n\"The biggest reason for anger is PSL Cricket returned to Pakistan after so many years, the PSL was happening in our country for the first time now even that is at risk.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Study of positive coronavirus cases in two of the worst affected countries, China and Italy points to somewhat selective pattern of the spread of Covid-19. That the novel coronavirus targets the older people and avoids the young ones. \nSituation gets complicated leading to deaths if the elderly patient already has some medical issues such as breathing problems, diabetes, heart-related ailments and kidney problems. \nThe mean age of those succumbing to novel coronavirus in Italy was reported to be 81 last week. Italy is known as the country with old population; more than 60 per cent of its total population is over 40. This is said to have contributed to more infections and deaths in Italy than places such as South Korea or even Japan.\nChina too is considered a country of aging peopulation. This refers to share of elderly people (above 60) crossing 10 per cent in the total population. China's elderly (above 60) are more than 17 per cent in its total population. Incidentally in China, the Centre for Disease Control reached a similar conclusion as Italy after examining over 72,000 cases that the disease is deadlier in older people. This is also the conclusion of the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nIn India, all the three deaths due to novel coronavirus infection have happened in the cases of elderly patients. The youngest of them was 64. All had previous medical conditions.\nTwo main reasons have been attributed to this age specific coronavirus spread pattern. First, it is a medical fact that immunity is strongest in childhood and decreases with advancement in age. DNA, the genetic material that guides most functions of human body, is agile in childhood and responds quicker to alien particles entering the body. This boosts immunity. With advancement of age, the DNA messaging gets corrupted and the right message to disease fighting cells are not delivered efficiently.\nSecondly, in most countries, coronavirus testing are symptomatic in process. That is, only those showing synonyms are being tested for novel coronavirus infection. This means a number of children may be passing off without being tested for novel coronavirus. \nWith stronger immunity, children may not show symptoms of novel coronavirus infection even if they have contracted the contagion. Untested children means more adults entering the records and hence further skew in the final data.\nThis does not mean that children are completely immune to novel coronavirus infection. At two cases -- one each from China and the UK -- were reported about newborns having tested positive for novel coronavirus. Though, the disease Covid-19 has not been found to be transferring from mother to child during pregnancy. A three-year-old child tested positive for Covid-19 in India. She is the youngest Covid-19 patient in India.\nBut the fact that children are largely untested underscores that they can be carriers or vectors of novel coronavirus. Also, medical conditions like asthma and diabetes are not uncommon among children. In many cases obesity-linked diabetes and asthma are related. In such cases, novel coronavirus infection can be fatal for children.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "对中国和意大利这两个受影响最严重的国家的冠状病毒阳性病例的研究表明，Covid-19的传播有一定的选择性。新型冠状病毒针对老年人而避开年轻人。\n如果老年患者已经有一些医疗问题，如呼吸问题、糖尿病、心脏相关疾病和肾脏问题，情况会变得复杂，导致死亡。\n据报道，上周意大利死于新型冠状病毒感染者的平均年龄为81岁。意大利素有老年人口之称，总人口的60%以上在40岁以上。据说，这导致意大利的感染和死亡人数超过了韩国甚至日本等地。\n中国也被认为是人口老龄化的国家。这是指超过10%的老年人（60岁以上）占总人口的比例。中国老年人（60岁以上）占总人口的17%以上。顺便说一句，在中国，疾病控制中心在对72000多例老年人死亡病例进行检查后，得出了与意大利相似的结论。这也是世界卫生组织（WHO）的结论。\n在印度，新的冠状病毒感染导致的三例死亡都发生在老年患者身上。他们中最小的64岁。所有人都有过前科。\n有两个主要原因是由于这种年龄特异性冠状病毒传播模式。首先，这是一个医学事实，免疫在儿童时期最强，随着年龄的增长而降低。DNA是指导人体大部分功能的遗传物质，在儿童时期非常灵敏，对进入人体的外来粒子反应更快。这会提高免疫力。随着年龄的增长，DNA信息会被破坏，而传递给抗病细胞的正确信息并不能有效地传.\n其次，在大多数国家，冠状病毒检测是有症状的。也就是说，只有那些显示同义词的人正在接受新型冠状病毒感染的检测。这意味着许多儿童可能会在没有接受新型冠状病毒检测的情况下死亡。\n由于免疫力较强，即使感染了这种病毒，儿童也可能不会出现新的冠状病毒感染症状。未经测试的儿童意味着更多的成年人进入记录，从而进一步扭曲最终数据。\n这并不意味着儿童对新型冠状病毒感染完全免疫。据报道，在两个病例中，中国和英国各有一例新生儿的新型冠状病毒检测呈阳性。尽管如此，Covid-19并没有被发现在怀孕期间从母亲转移到孩子身上。印度一名3岁儿童的Covid-19检测呈阳性。她是印度最年轻的Covid-19病人。\n但事实上，儿童大多未经测试，这突出表明他们可能是新冠状病毒的携带者或载体。此外，哮喘和糖尿病等疾病在儿童中并不少见。在许多情况下，肥胖与糖尿病和哮喘有关。在这种情况下，新的冠状病毒感染可致命的儿童",

Speculation about a delay from the July start date has grown since U.S. President Donald Trump said organisers should consider a one-year postponement.\nAbe and Trump held a call after those comments, prompting the U.S. president to say on Twitter that the Olympic venue was magnificent. But this may not be enough to assuage sponsors of the Games, who are increasingly nervous about how the impact of the outbreak on the competition.\nThe Olympic Torch relay, in which the Olympic flame typically starts a tour around the host nation, is due to start in the Japanese prefecture of Fukushima in less than two weeks. The tour of the torch through Greece has already been cut short.\n\"We will overcome the spread of the infection and host the Olympics without problem, as planned,\" Abe told a news conference in Tokyo, adding that delaying or cancelling the Olympics was \"not a subject at all\" in his call with Trump.\nHe said Japan working closely with the International Olympic Committee, which will have the final decision whether the Games go ahead, and the U.N. World Health Organization, suggesting he accepted that Tokyo would not ultimately decide on the event.\nHe said Japan had a relatively low infection rate and had not seen an explosion in cases as seen in South Korea, China, Italy, Iran and elsewhere. He said delaying the peak of infections was vital to ensure treatment of those in critical condition.\nTORCH RELAY\nAbe said Japan did not need to declare a national emergency, although parliament on Friday approved a bill to give him emergency powers and allow him to close schools, halt large gatherings and requisition medical supplies.\nTokyo Governor Yuriko Koike promised thorough measures against the coronavirus outbreak and said preparations for a \"safe and secure\" Games were progressing, TV Asahi reported.\nGreece's Olympic Committee cancelled on Friday the remainder of the Olympic Torch relay through Greece to avoid attracting crowds, while the relay through Japan is scheduled to start on March 26.\nJapan had 21 new coronavirus cases as of Saturday evening, bringing the total 1,443, public broadcaster NHK reported, while the has killed 28 people in Japan.\nThe total infections included 697 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and 14 returnees on chartered flights from China, according to NHK.

        "news_content_translate_en": "People around the world became increasingly closed off from one another Thursday as sweeping travel bans accelerated,walling regions apart as a viral pandemic unfolds and financial markets plunge.\nIt was an outbreak moving, at once, both glacially and explosively, with a virus first detected three months ago in China creeping across borders and producing eruptive outbreaks that have crippled areas.\nEven for a crisis that has brought no shortage of headlines, dizzying developments were flashing across screens: An official designation of \"pandemic\" from the World Health Organisation, a dramatic halt to much travel between the US and 26 European countries, and infections among beloved Hollywood stars, sports luminaries and political leaders.\nAll of it came against a backdrop of plunging world economies that left not only Wall Street investors but people from all walks of life hurting.\n\"We will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now,\" said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\nPresident Donald Trump, who had downplayed the virus for days, suddenly struck a different tone, delivering a sombre Oval Office address announcing strict rules on travel from much of Europe to begin this weekend.\nThe State Department followed with an extraordinary warning to Americans to \"reconsider travel abroad\" too. Local leaders warned things would only get worse.\n\"This will be a very difficult time,\" said Dr Jeff Duchin a top public health official for the Seattle area, which has one of the biggest US outbreaks.\n\"It's similar to what you might think of as an infectious disease equivalent of a major earthquake that's going to shake us for weeks and weeks.\"\nAcross the US, where cases now number more than 1,300, a sense of urgency was pervasive.\nNursing homes turned away visitors, schools emptied of students and workplace cubicles went vacant. A rite of spring, college basketball's March Madness, was set to proceed in empty arenas, while professional basketball won't play at all.\nJoyous, booze-filled, green-splashed celebrations of St Patrick's Day were called off. TV shows taped without audiences, rush-hour crowds in New York subway cars disappeared, and families hunkered down wondering what would come next.\n\"If we avoid each other and listen to the scientists, maybe in a few weeks it will be better,\" said Koloud 'Kay' Tarapolsi of Redmond, Washington, who has two children whose schools were being closed beginning Thursday.\nAs the pandemic grips Europe and the US, it continues to ebb in China, where the first cases of COVID-19 emerged in December. It reported a record low of just 15 new cases Thursday and was cautiously monitoring new arrivals who were returning with the virus from elsewhere.\nMore than three-fourths of China's patients have recovered. Most people have only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, though symptoms can be severe, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with existing health problems.\nRecovery for mild cases takes about two weeks, while more severe illness may take three to six weeks, WHO says.\nMore than 126,000 people in more than 110 countries have been infected. But WHO emphasized the vast majority are in just four countries: China and South Korea - where new cases are declining - and Iran and Italy, where they are not.\n\"We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action,\" said WHO's leader, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear.\"\nHigh-profile announcements of infections made the alarms even louder. Double Oscar winner Tom Hanks said he and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive. Australian officials say the couple are in a Queensland hospital and their close contacts would have to self-quarantine.\nIn Italy, soccer club Juventus said defender Daniele Rugani tested positive. In Iran, the senior vice president and two other Cabinet ministers were reported to have been diagnosed with COVID-19.\nItaly, already under unprecedented restrictions, tightened rules even more. Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte announcing the closure of pubs, restaurants, hair salons, cafeterias and other businesses that can't ensure a meter (yard) of space between workers and customers.\n\"In this moment, all the world is looking at us,\" Conte said, as the rules brought an eerie hush to places around Italy.\nAsian shares plunged Thursday, following a drop of 1,464 points of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, putting the index 20 percent below its record set last month and into fearsome territory Wall Street calls a \"bear market\".\n\"There's a real feeling that we don't know where this ends,\" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Indian benchmark equity indices on Thursday collapsed once again as Sensex fell over 2,500 points while Nifty was down over 760 points or over seven per cent. The stock market shock comes a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.\nAs far as domestic stock markets are concerned, the freefall has led to a significant rise in the volatility index, which indicates that investors still remain worried about the prevailing economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak.\nHere are key factors which led to the bloodbath on D-Street on Thursday:\nCoronavirus now a pandemic\nThe coronavirus is now a pandemic, declared WHO on Thursday. The development was announced by WHO in view of the rapid rise in Covid-19 infections around the globe. Declaring it as a pandemic triggered a massive slump in stock markets across the world. Asian, European and US market indices took a pounding as investors remain spooked. The US has suspended travel from Europe while India has suspended all tourist visa till April 15.\nIn the morning trade, aviation and tourism stocks plummeted sharply after as a result of the fresh restrictions on travel.\nIt is worth mentioning that the WHO has declared the novel coronavirus as a pandemic and added that Italy and Iran were the hotspot countries. It said other countries could join them soon.\nThe WHO declared the new coronavirus as a pandemic for the first time on Wednesday, adding that Italy and Iran were now on the frontline of the disease and other countries would soon join them. The global toll death toll has crossed 4,500 while India has recorded at least 73 positive cases.\nOil slides further\nAnother reason why domestic stock markets fell was a further slide in global crude oil prices. Oil prices have continued to slide since the major crash on March 6 following a meeting of the OPEC countries and Russia. A price war was triggered as Saudi slashed oil prices, resulting in the collapse of global crude oil prices.\nWhile prices had recovered slightly on March 11, the lower prices keep hurting sentiments of major oil companies in the country. Power and energy companies are also taking a pounding in the domestic stock market due to reduced prices. Though the general notion is that India benefits from any cut in global crude prices, the recent deep cut may not be ideal for the country.\nSharp fall in oil prices also has a greater impact on the equity market, as witnessed in the past few days. It could even disrupt the flow for foreign capital into the India market if crude prices keep falling.\nGlobal market rout\nNot just India but markets around the globe have witnessed carnage over the past few days due to the coronavirus outbreak. From Dow Jones in the US to other major markets in the world, each one has registered serious falls due to rising doubts over the total financial impact of the virus outbreak.\nStock markets around the world crumbled after Trump's move, with U.S. stock index futures diving 4.7% and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbling 4.1% to its lowest level since early 2019.\nAs the virus keeps spreading across the globe rapidly, analysts expect the carnage to continue until there is a global decline in new positive cases.\nInvestors will also be monitoring the situation in China, which conveyed that the number of cases in the epicentre Hubei province and Wuhan reduced significantly.\n",

Families across Delhi are cutting down on celebrations and have cancelled pool parties. There is hardly any demand for Chinese colours and pichkaris in Delhi-NCR. Shops in the capital are deserted. Instead of buying colours, water guns and balloons, the demand for hand sanitizers and masks is on the rise.\nMask and sanitizer clad Holi awaits this time. Before colours and pichkaris, I bought masks and sanitisers to maintain cleanliness, sanitation and hygiene. We had a hard time convincing our kids to use these instead of colours. Finally, the kids have now understood the seriousness of the situation, said Rajendra, a resident of Dwarka.\nTraders said that the spread of the virus has led to decrease in the demand for Chinese Holi related goods. In Sarojini Nagar market, the sellers of water guns and balloons complained that because of the fear of Coronavirus, people aren't even willing to buy products which are made in India. I kept aside all products which came to me last year from China. This time everything at my shop is Made in India’ but because of the fear of the spread of coronavirus, my sale has come down by 80 percent, said Mukesh, a trader in Babu Market.\nJeetu, a resident of Dwarka, said they are avoiding large gatherings this year. This time, we are witnessing multi dimensional effects of coronavirus. It has not just affected our trade but we're constantly worried about our family. To start with, we're boycotting all social gatherings and will be celebrating only with our closed family members.\nNagendra, another resident of Dwarka, said this year Holi will be celebrated over social media. I think it's going to be the social media Holi this year where we'll greet everyone on social media platforms to adhere to the advisories being circulated by the government. I've instructed my wife and children to stay indoors and enjoy Holi with herbal gulaal and good movies.\nTrader Sanjeev too said he will be avoiding close contact with people this Holi. Somewhere, we all know that the threat is still there. However, convincing the same to children is really difficult but our RWA is ensuring minimum outsiders and maximum fun. We'll greet everyone, exchange colours and that'll be it. Avoiding uncovered and manufactured food is extremely important, so we're not going to exchange sweets and chocolates this time. This way, the children will stay safe as well.\n",

The ophthalmologist said all seven patients had eaten animal meat from the same seafood market in Hubei.\nLi explained that, according to a test he had seen, the illness was a coronavirus -- a large family of viruses that includes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which led to 800 death in China and the world in 2003.\nChina has a troubled history with Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Diseases). A Sars outbreak in 2003 in Southern China had left more than 8,000 people infected and 774 dead over 17 nations.\nLi's message was meant to be a cautionary note for his medical school friends to take care of their loved ones. But within hours of Wenliang revealing the information, the chats spread like wildfire on Chinese social media.\nHis name was exposed to hundreds of citizens. \"When I saw them circulating online, I realised that it was out of my control and I would probably be punished,\" Li was quoted as saying by CNN recently.\nAnd that is exactly what happened.\nAUTHORITIES SILENCE NEWS OF OUTBREAK\nOn January 3, Chinese authorities summoned Li and seven other doctors and accused them of spreading rumours. A stern message calling for an end to rumour-mongering was broadcast across China.\n\"The police call on all netizens to not fabricate rumours, not spread rumours, not believe rumours,\" the message read.\nLi was made to sign an affidavit acknowledging his crime and had to promise he will not engage in any such activities in the future.\nBut Li's troubles did not end there.\nThe ophthalmologist returned to work soon. While treating a patient affected with coronavirus, the infection was also transmitted to Li. Over the coming days, he showed the same symptoms -- coughing, shortness of breath and fever.\nBy January 12, he was admitted to a hospital.

Five are in serious condition, two died and 15 have been discharged. The others are in stable condition./nThe cause of the pneumonia has been traced to a new type of coronavirus.

The list includes Thailand and Japan, which have together reported three cases of the disease in people who had come from Wuhan. It is an unusually busy travel period as people take trips to and from China around Lunar New Year, which falls on Jan. 25 this year./nDoctors began seeing a new type of viral pneumonia -- fever, cough, difficulty breathing -- in people who worked at or visited a food market in the suburbs of Wuhan late last month. The city's health commission confirmed a second death this week, a 69-year-old man who fell ill on Dec. 31 and died Wednesday./nOfficials have said the pneumonia probably spread from animals to people but haven't been able to rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission, which would enable it to spread much faster./nNo related cases have been found so far among 763 people who had close contact with those diagnosed with the virus in Wuhan. Of them, 665 have been released and 98 remain under medical observation, the Wuhan health authorities said./n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "This Wednesday, the blockade that has lasted more than two months around Hubei Province is lifted, but in its capital, Wuhan, where the pandemic of the new coronavirus has begun, the quarantine remains strict until April 8th. This is another step in the appeal and gradual authorisation to return to normality made a week ago by the authorities of the country that was the epicentre of the pandemic and wants to regain its economy. But although there are more people on the street, factories resuming work and even some traffic jams and open-air cinemas, the new normal is technologically controlled, raises doubts from experts and is still shy.\nFor the 60 million inhabitants of Hubei, the end of the draconian quarantine depends on the health test of each citizen. And this proof is the \"green code\" that appears in the application of the Health Code mobile phone, which has become almost ubiquitous and potentially omnipotent, As alerted by the New York Times at the beginning of the month. You may also be sharing personal data and location with the police, increasing control of China over its citizens, and is essential to circulate in many parts of the country. The application categorizes each Chinese citizen (or immigrant) according to their state of health.\nAvailable via popular services such as WeChat or Alipay (and associated with the Chinese online shopping giant Alibaba), has been used as an expedient to control the Chinese population in their gigantic containment operation during the epidemic; now, it remains a condition to enter office buildings, transport It is also a very concrete symbol of the concern that some residents have shown for what lies in the aftermath of the den-19: greater and growing control of the state over its citizensYeah.\nThe Chinese draconian operation to contain the new coronavirus has been in the field for about eight weeks now that official numbers say there are hardly any new cases originating in China itself, the government's message is that the big threat is imported cases. And China has won the fight and is returning to normal. The Chinese President, Xi Jinping, called \"urgent\" for the leaders of his government and the Chinese Communist Party to resume productivity and daily life in regions considered to be low-risk. Economic prosperity is one of the validation tools of the Chinese Government.\n\"The productive Chinese factories are steaming to stabilize the world's supply chains\", titled the official website of the government of Xi Jinping a few days ago. A week ago, Al-Jazira realized that cities with strong corporate fabric, like Guangzhou and Shenzhen, were calling the workers back to the factories. On Monday, there was talk again of traffic jams in Beijing and European Space Agency satellites have already detected an increase in carbon dioxide emissions, pollution mainly from industry activity in China.\nAl-Jazira also reported that provincial students with \"low risk of infection\", such as Guizhou, Qinghai, Tibet and Xinjiang, were returning to classes; the Guardian reported the same at the end of last week, observing the return of students from outside the capital to Beijing, with the most crowded trains and the most compound rides. In Hubei, schools will remain closed. And, as the correspondent of Time magazine in Shanghai, office buildings reopen, but without air conditioning to avoid contamination, taxis circulate but have plastics to separate them from customers and foreigners ar e more subject to security and police questions when walking down the street.\nEach Chinese province has its own rules and travel between some of them may still require two weeks of quarantine, for examplYeah. On the other hand, Chinese television already had entertainment again and on the 13th day Apple reopened its 42 shops in China after a month of closure. It is just one of many chains, restaurants or bars that have once again received customers, but under rules that remain tight. Body temperature is controlled at the door, there are limits on the number of people sitting at table and in the case of the 44KW nightclub in Shanghai, the Health Code application is essential in order to be able to enter; the Guardian reports that foreigners have to show their passport by listing the countries they have gone through. And if more than 500 cinemas have reopened until Monday, it should be noted that they are only five% of the vast Chinese exhibition market, which are in low-central provinces and which are showing old films, and, above all, few spectators are still likely to enter.\nAs regards this new Chinese phase after the peak of the den-19 apparently passed, there are still experts who are doubtful. It is not so much feared that there will be a second wave of cases in the country as that this alleviating of restrictions will make Chinese society vulnerable again, There are reports in the press (such as in reputed Caixin magazine) and on social networks of alleged cases of people with no symptoms or announcements of new cases in Wuhan that are not being made public, for example. The Wuhan authorities, reporting from China, deny, but confidence in central and local power has been shaken since the country's initial management of the coronavirus crisis.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\n\"It is likely that the number of cases will increase once control measures are relieved. This means that they will have to remain vigilant for a new outbreak of cases and decide how to respond,\"says Jennifer Nuzzo, epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, cited by the GuardiaYeah. Malik Peiris, who was in charge of Virology from the University of Hong Kong to the New York Times, said Tuesday, \"to impose these measures again (isolation of the population), if necessary in the future\".\nVictor Shih, professor of politics at the University of California, adds another perspective on the potential to recreate the disease, based on the relative credibility of the numbers of the Chinese authorities and of what is happening in the hospitals of the country. \"One way to resume economic activity without panic is to cover up cases, while the government does its best to identify and contain them,\"he said to the Guardian on Monday. \"There is a risk of this leading to another outbreak, but for now it seems to be a risk that the government is willing to take.\"\nIn Wuhan, on Monday small groups of inhabitants began to leave their homes, timidly. At the weekend a train arrived with over a thousand workers from the same province of Hubei to return to their jobs in Wuhan. Still, fear persists in the city of 11 million people. \"Everyone is being very careful,\" says Guardian Iris Yao, who has been in Wuhan since the beginning of isolation accompanying the parents",

After China, the new coronavirus appears to be testing health devices and a consequent response from European (but not only) countries to an epidemic.\nIn just over three days, Italy has seen an exponential increase in positive cases: if only three people infected with the virus were accounted for by Friday, and all of them identified as new arrivals from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began at the end of last year, This Tuesday, three more people died, raising the balance sheet to 11.\nThe cases of the past few days are causing a race to the masks. This Tuesday, the Italian judicial authorities launched an investigation into the rapid escalation of prices for the online sale of products such as clinical masks and disinfectant gel bottles, with deputy attorney general from Milan, Sicilian Tiziana, The online price of masks rose from one cent to ten euros each and a bottle of disinfectant gel that cost seven euros a week ago rose to 39 euros,\"she said, quoted by Reuters.\nItaly already sums up the equivalent of about one third of the deaths outside China, with more than 300 confirmed cases, but continues to seek its \"patient zero\" and tightens the restraint measures. The most medi a-oriented actions were the interruption of the Venice Carnival, which came to an end on Sunday and should only end this Tuesday.\nHowever, the most impact measures for Italian citizens were the containment measures announced this weekend for ten localities, and where around fifty thousand people live: Avieto, Piamonte and Lombardy are the critical regionsYeah.\nFor the time being, the death pattern in Italy is similar to that in China. Older people with associated diseases, such a s cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and others that depress the immune system, are being most affected.\nThe Croatian Prime Minister, Andrej Plenkovivic, confirmed the first case of infection in the Balkan country. \"The patient is in an infectious disease clinic in Zagreb. He's a younger person, and he has mild symptoms. He is in isolation and his condition is positive at the moment,\"explained the ruler cited by The Guardian.\nA few minutes earlier Austria was confirming the first two cases detected. A spokesman for the health authority of the province of Tyrol, bordering the northern region of Italy, confirmed that two Italians tested positive for control of the coronavirus. The local media claim that the governor of this Austrian province, Guenther Platter, said that the two men had recently travelled to Lombardy, one of the most affected in the neighbouring country, pointing to this displacement as the likely cause of infection.\nSpain has already added the seventh case, the regional government of Catalonia has today confirmed the first case in the autonomous community, as well as Valencia and Madrid. Today, the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in the southern part of the island of Tenerife in the Canaries has been quarantined by the Spanish authorities. About a thousand tourists inside are in isolation and will be subjected to medical examinations. This is because, on Monday, an Italian tourist who was staying there was diagnosed with the new Covid-19 coronavirusYeah.\nDespite the detection of new cases in recent days in some European countries, Italy's neighbouring countries decided not to restore their borders, \"We agreed to keep the borders open, since closing them would be disproportionate and inefficient at this time,\" said the Italian Minister for Health, Roberto Speranza, following a meeting with European counterparts, cited by Reuters.\nPortugal is stepping up prevention measures and the network of available laboratories and hospitals to receive suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus, Covid-19. Also information at airports is being strengthened and flights from Italy, which is experiencing the biggest outbreak of the disease in Europe, will have distribution of leaflets indicating the criteria for suspicious cases and the number of SNS 24 line, to which people are to call.\nSo far all the suspicious cases in Portugal have had negative results. At closing time, two suspicious cases were being examined in Portugal, two citizens who recently returned from Milan.\nThis Tuesday, speaking in the margins of an initiative at Amadora, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said that it is \"impossible\" to close the borders and that the solution is a \"joint action as is being done now\".\nAdriano Maranh o, Portuguese infected with Covid-19 at the Diamond Princess, a Japanese cruise ship, was transferred this Tuesday to a hospital in Okazaki City, Aichi Province, told Lusa to his wife, Emmanuelle Maranho. bus to Fujita University Health Hospital, a newly constructed hospital whose opening was scheduled for April.\nBut it is not only in Europe that we are fighting against Covid-19. Meanwhile, the South Korean authorities are preparing to undergo medical examinations more than 220 thousand people belonging to a religious cultYeah. The Government considers that this organization, the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji, has played a key role in the spread of the new coronavirus (Covid-19) in the country. The leader of this group has agreed to cede to the authorities the identification of the members so that they can be subject to clinical control.\nOn Sunday, South Korea reported the highest alert level, due to the number of cases of infection with the new coronavirus, which reached 602 with six deaths. More than half of the cases are related to a religious ceremony in the city of Daegu, in the southeast of the country, in which a woman of 61's took part, who did not travel out of the country, but who is considered to be the South Korean \"zero\" patient.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIn addition to deaths in mainland China, there are reports of fatalities in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines, France and Taiwan. Today, the World Health Organisation (WHO) gave a warning to all countries: the specialist who led the WHO team sent to China said that the world \"simply is not ready\" to face the epidemic of the new coronavirus.\n\"We must be ready to manage this on a large scale, and this must be done quickly,\" but the world \"simply is not ready,\" said Bruce Aylward at a press conference in Geneva, referring to the possibility of a new coronavirus pandemic, Covid-19. \"We are not ready as we should be,\" both from a psychological and a material point of view, he said.\nThe interim assessment of the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic is of 2707 dead and about 80.300 infected people in about thirty countries, according to the latest data",

        "news_content_translate_en": "At the end of 2019, a coronavirus has broken through the species barrier, reached humans and is scaring the world. Since it's a new virus infecting humans, there's still a lot to know about it. The scientific community and public health authorities have been working together to get to know the details and as soon as possible. What do we really know about this epidemic with epicenter in the city of Wuhan in the center of China?\nAre there already cases in Portugal of infection with the new coronavirus? Yes, the first two cases of Portuguese with Covid-19 were confirmed this Monday (2nd March). The first case was one of a 60-year-old doctor on holiday in northern Italy. He was admitted to St. Anthony's Hospital in Porto and experienced the first symptoms on 29 in February. The second case was confirmed by a 33-year-old commercial in the construction sector returned from Valencia, Spain. He was admitted to St John's Hospital in Oporto and experienced the first symptoms at 26 in February. This Tuesday, the Directorate-General for Health (DGS) confirmed two more cases: that of a man 60-year-old who is connected to another case already confirmed in Portugal and is at the University Hospital Centre of St John in Oporto; and that of a man 37 years since he was also linked to another case and is at Curry Cabral Hospital in Lisbon.\nWhat's the name of the virus and the disease? The official name of the virus is coronavirus of severe acute 2 respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), as it has genetic similarities to SARS-CoV in about 80%. This designation was assigned by the International Committee for Virus Taxonomy and published this week in an article in the bioRxiv free access repository. Until then, it has been temporarily designated \"2019-nCoV\".\nThe name chosen for the disease caused by the virus was \"Covid-19\", which emerged from the English acronym for the expression \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (coronavirus disease 2019Yeah. The decision was taken by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in collaboration with the World Organisation for Animal Health and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.\nBoth the name of the virus and the disease were chosen in such a way that there are no references to specific geographical locations, groups of people or animals, so that stigmatisation is avoided.\nIs it known what the origin of the new coronavirus is and how it passed on to humans? No, there are only suspicions. In a recent report, the WHO indicated that there is increasing evidence that there is a link between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses found in bats, especially those of subspecies of the genus Rhinolophus, which are abundant in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. The transmission circuit is also unknown and \"the most likely scenario is that an intermediate host animal played a role in the transmission\". Last week, a team of Chinese scientists concluded that Pangolim is a potential intermediate host of the virus.\nDiscovering the source of the coronavirus may help to understand how the onset of the outbreak took place in Wuhan City and thus prevent future coronavirus outbreaks. There are several teams, including one from the WHO in China, trying to answer these and other questions.\nWhat symptoms does it cause? Dry cough, fever, fatigue and difficulty breathing. Most people have flu-like symptoms and a small proportion of patients will develop pneumonia. In the most serious cases of pneumonia, organ failure may occur and Covid-19 becomes fatal.\nHow is it transmitted? Through direct contact with infected people. This can happen through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, saliva droplets or nose secretions. Therefore, the WHO recommends having a \"good respiratory hygiene practice\", such as sneezing at the elboYeah. It is also important that people wash their hands regularly when they are in contact with people with the symptoms of Covid-19.\nAlthough the origin may have been an animal, there is no evidence to indicate that a domestic animal can transmit this coronavirus. Even so, the WHO states that food should be cooked with care to avoid cross contamination or to pay attention to contact with live animals or areas on live animal markets.\nAs to whether it is safe to receive an order from China, one of the most frequently asked questions, the WHO undoubtedly answers: \"It is safe. People are not in danger of contracting the new coronavirus if they receive orders. From the experience we have of other coronaviruses, this type of virus does not survive long in objects such as letters and packages.\"\nCan asymptomatic people really transmit this coronavirus? Yes, it may be possible that people infected with the virus may be infectious before showing significant symptoms, refers to WHO, which cites recent reports. Even so, according to the available data, people who have symptoms are causing most of the cases. It takes more clinical information to determine what the infectious period is.\nAnd what is the incubation period? For now, it is estimated that it can go from one to 12,5 days and that the average is between five to six days. The WHO states that these estimates should still be improved, but on the basis of information on other coronavirus diseases, the incubation period should be four days.\nIn February, a team of Chinese scientists announced that the average incubation period would be only three days and that this period could extend to 24 days. These preliminary results were briefly reported at the MedRxiv Health Science Research portaYeah. At a press conference, the Director General for Portuguese Health, Grace Freitas, did not value the study, saying it is information \"that is not validated\", \"one of the many studies that are circulating\" and that the WHO does not even mention it.\nHow dangerous can this virus be? Based on the available data, the mortality rate is about three%. However, this number may be overestimated because it only takes into account confirmed cases and there may be even more infected people, according to information made available by the UK Science Media Centre.\nHave we reached the peak of the epidemic? We don't know yet. February 12th, the WHO announced that the number of new cases of coronavirus had stabilised the previous week. However, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, warred that care was needed for interpretations made from there: \"This outbreak could still go in any direction.\" On the very next day more than 13 thousand new cases were recorded in a single day in the Hubei region, where Wuhan is. The WHO points out that this was due to a change in the way cases were diagnosed. \"We have seen a significant spike in the number of cases reported in China, but there is no significant change in the course of the Covid-19 outbreak,\" said Mike Ryan, Director of the WHO Emergency Programme at a press conference later this week. He also pointed out that Covid-19 cases are not rising dramatically outside China. The exception was on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which confirmed more 44 cases. All along, that ship quarantined in Japan already had over 200 confirmed cases.\nIn an interview with Reuters, epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan (researcher of the Chinese National Health Commission) was optimistic and stated that the peak of the outbreak could be reached in mid-or late April. But it's too early for prognosisYeah.\nWho could be more vulnerable to the virus? It has yet to be better understood how this coronavirus affects people, but older people and people with pre-existing diseases appear to be at greater risk of seriously developing Covid-19.\nHow many infected people have recovered worldwide? According to data from the real-time Worldometer statistics website of 80.026 confirmed cases in mainland China, 44.462 (56%) managed to recover from the disease. According to Johns Hopkins University (USA), the recovery rate in China exceeds the 50%barrier.\nHow long does the virus survive on the surfaces? It is not well known either, but WHO refers to preliminary information suggesting that it may survive \"a few hours or more\". Simple disinfectants may be enough for the virus not to last long enough to infect people.\nIs there a specific treatment? No, there is still no specific medicine or treatment recommended to prevent or treat Covid-19. Infected people receive health care to alleviate or treat their symptoms. In the most serious cases, they receive organ support therapy. Because it's a virus, the WHO warns that antibiotics won't kill it.\nApproximately 300 experts meeting in Geneva (Switzerland) in February at a meeting organised by the WHO set out different priorities: the treatment of people already infected with Covid-19; finding easy ways to test; and understanding the behaviour of the virus.\nDetails of the treatments for the virus were also given. Quoted by New Scientist magazine, WHO noted that results of clinical trials to determine whether HIV medicines (lopinavir and ritonavir) are effective for treating Covid-19 symptoms \"will be known in a few days or weeksYeah. Clinical trials for remdesivir (which was initially developed for Ebola virus) are also expected to be ready in \"a few weeks\". Four Covid-19 vaccines are also being developed at the moment. The WHO estimated that in three or four months'time, people would start testing for one or two of these vaccines and that one would be available for general use in 18 months' time.\nWhat are the recommendations for people to protect themselves? These are the basic recommendations used to reduce any risk of acute respiratory infection and are mainly for travellers, such as: avoiding close contact with people with these infections; frequently washing their hands, especially after being in direct contact with sick people; avoid unprotected contact with wild animals or for human consumption; or adopt respiratory label measures.\nIf you have been in an area where Covid-19 has existed or still exists, you should follow the recommendations of the WHO and the national and local health authorities. If you have not been in an area where you have Covid-19 and have not been with infected people, your risk of infection is low, refers to the WHO in a recent report. \"It is understandable that you may be anxious about this epidemic. But check the facts from credible sources to help you determine the risks accurately and be able to take reasonable precautions,\"he also recommends to the WHO. The Health Directorate has created a website dedicated to the new coronavirus.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nIf you have symptoms, what should you do? In general, the Directorate-General for Health recommends that people coming from an affected area where they may have had contact with patients should actively monitor and contact the SNS 24 (808 24 24) line to get advice on what to do. \"It will be a case-by-case worYeah. And other measures may be defined from the counselling,\"said Grace Freitas, Director General of Health, at a press conference.\nWhich Portuguese hospitals may receive infected patients? In the north of the country, they are able to receive patients with the new coronavirus hospitals of San Juan and San Antonio, both in Oporto, as well as the Braga Hospital, the Local Health Unit (ULS) of Matosinhos and the Tamega and Sousa Hospitality Centre. At the center, the response is reinforced at the Guard ULS and the Coimbra Children's Hospital. In the region of Lisbon and Vale do Tejo, are the University of Lisbon Centre for Hospitality Northern (Santa Maria Hospital and Pulido Valente Hospital) and the Western Lisbon University Hospital for Hospitality (Egas Moniz Hospital and San Francisco Xavier Hospital). In Alentejo, she is ready to admit patients with the new coronavirus to Litoral ULS Alentejano. In the Algarve, the answer is provided through the Algarve University Hospitality Centre.\nIs this a pandemic already? No. The WHO considers that coronavirus is not yet a pandemic, a term used to describe situations in which an infectious disease threatens many people simultaneously and around the world. \"We are in an epidemic phase with multiple outbreaks,\" said Sylvie Briand, director of the global preparedness department for WHO infectious risks. At the moment, over a 90 thousand people are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have died from more than three thousand people around the world, according to the data from the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). Italy is the country of Europe with the most recorded cases, going beyond the 1600s. One of the main fears of the WHO is that the epidemic should reach African countries with weak health care, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, as has highlighted Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus",

The numbers should not stop here and even be aggravated by the end of the prolonged Chinese Lunar New Year holiday. To find out which countries the virus can be imported more easily, scientists from Germany have used a computational model. In the case of Portugal, the risk of importing the coronavirus is \"very low\", with the country in the 61st position on the relative risk list for importing the virus. The Health Directorate (DGS) also announced this Monday two more suspected cases of infection with the new coronavirus were six so far, and one of them was already negative at the beginning of the night. The second suspicious case, which had been referred to the University Hospital Centre of San Juan in Porto, it also had a negative result, informed the DGS already this Tuesday, a few minutes after midnight.\nCases of the new coronavirus have been confirmed in more than twenty countries. Even if the vast majority of cases are limited to China, there is still concern that they may spread further around the world. In order to assess the risk of importing cases to other countries, a team from the Humboldt University of Berlin and the Robert Koch Institute, both in Germany, used a computational model, considering the distribution of confirmed cases in China and the 4000 airport air transport network and more than 50.000 air routes. Airport closures due to the epidemic have already been included in the model.\nIt was concluded that Thailand (in addition to China) is the country most likely to have people arriving from one of the airports analysed with coronavirus. This list follows Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Cambodia. The first European country on this list is Germany, which is in 18th placeYeah. Although Angola is on the list of 13 African countries with top priority for the World Health Organisation (WHO) in the fight against the new coronavirus, it does not include the top-10 of African countries with the highest risk of importation in this model. This top is headed by Ethiopia, followed by Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritius, Reunion, Nigeria and Tunisia. Overall, according to the model, Angola is in 115th place.\n\"Portugal has a very low risk of import,\" says Public Dirk Brockmann of Humboldt University. \"It is in 61.th position with a relative import risk of 0,01%, which is about 20 times smaller than the risk of Germany.\" Nevertheless, while Germany has a risk of 0,2%, Thailand has 2,2%. Dirk Brockmann points out that the purpose of this model is to give an overview of the current situation and be a risk analysis tool that can be used by policy makers and public health authorities. In addition to providing country-specific alerts, the model provides data for specific airports.\nAlthough we've given so much to talk about, we still don't know enough about the new coronavirus. Efforts have not been lacking and scientists around the world have been paying attention to the virus. Among the latest news is the publication of the complete biomolecular code of the virus.\nSamples of the new coronavirus have been processed in laboratories around the world and raw information about the genetic code has been sent to the repository of the United States National Health Institutions. From there, a team from the University of California in Santa Cruz (USA) collected information from 29.903 nucleotides, adenine, timine, cytosine and guanine, the basic chemical elements that make up the DNA molecule, represented by letters A, T, C and G, and made it available in the public database Genome Browser BrowserYeah.\n\"By providing data on coronavirus in the Browser Genome at the University of California in Santa Cruz, this allows investigators to observe the structure of the virus and, more importantly, investigate how they can attack it,\" stated Hiram Clawson, a researcher at that university.\nThe way this coronavirus is transmitted has been another major issue. CoronVirus is transmitted by respiratory droplets, direct contact with infected secretions and aerosols in therapeutic procedures that produce them, DGS states. But how long does it persist on surfaces and how can it be inactivated? Two professors from the Greifswald University Hospital in Germany tried to answer these questions.\nTo find answers, they analyzed studies on coronavirus SARS and MERS. It was found that these viruses could persist on surfaces and remain infectious at room temperature on average between four and five days. \"Low temperatures and high humidity in the air further increase your life span\", says Gunter Kampf in a statement from his institution.\nAs for the inactivation of the various coronaviruses in tests with disinfectant solutions, agents with ethanol, commonly oxygenated water or sodium hypochlorite were found to be effective against coronavirus. If these agents were applied at appropriate concentrations, they would reduce the pathogenic particles from one million to 100 in about one minute. For researchers, these results may be extrapolated to the new coronavirus. \"We analyzed different coronavirus and the results were similar\", says Eike Steinmann.\nThis Tuesday and Wednesday, scientists, public health agency professionals, health ministers and research backers will be meeting in Geneva (Switzerland) to set priorities in research and development of medicines, diagnostics and coronavirus vaccineYeah. In this meeting organized by the WHO in conjunction with the Global Research Collaboration for the Preparation of Infectious Diseases, we will discuss the origin of the virus, identify knowledge gaps or medical products that should be necessary to minimise the impact of the epidemic. \"The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus,\" says the WHO in communication.\nAn international mission led by the WHO also arrived in China this Monday to investigate the epidemic. Epidemiologists on this mission are trying to better understand how the transmission between people takes place, how the virus spreads in hospitals or why some people are dying.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nThis Monday was also marked by the visit of the President of China, Xi Jinping, to various sites in Beijing, notably a community centre, a hospital or disease control centre. Xi Jinping was always seen with a mask and his temperature was measured. At Ditan Hospital, where coronavirus-infected patients are being treated, Xi Jinping even took part in a video conference with health professionals in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, which the Chinese President has not yet visited.\nThis is considered a rare public appearance of Xi Jinping during the epidemic and occurred days after the death of doctor Li Wenliang, who tried to warn colleagues about the virus and ended up being punished for spreading rumors. The visit also took place on the day when many Chinese return to work after an extended Chinese Lunar New Year vacation. Therefore, the WHO has already stressed that the number of cases outside China may be just \"the tip of an iceberg\"",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WUHAN, China - The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak first emerged, began lifting a two-month lockdown on Saturday by restarting some metro services and reopening borders, allowing some semblance of normality to return and families to reunite.  \n After being cut-off from the rest of the country for two months, the reopening of Wuhan, where the epidemic first erupted in late December, marks a turning point in China's fight against the virus, though the contagion has since spread to over 200 countries.  \n Among those on the first high-speed trains allowed into the city on Saturday morning was Guo Liangkai, a 19-year-old student whose one-month work stint in Shanghai stretched to three months due to the clamp down on movement.  \n \"It makes me very happy that I can see my family,\" Guo told Reuters after being greeted by his mother at the main station.  \n \"We wanted to hug but now is a special period so we can't hug or take any actions like these.\"  \n Authorities took draconian measures to stop people from entering or leaving the industrial city of 11 million people in central China. Families were confined to their homes. Bus and taxi services were shut, and only essential stores were allowed to remain open.  \n \"I think the resumption of work represents a kind of hope. It at least shows that China is victorious,\" said Zhang Yulun, 35, returning to Wuhan for work.  \n China's National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. Mainland China now has 81,394 cases, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said.  \n Wuhan accounts for about 60% of China's coronavirus cases, but they have fallen sharply in recent weeks, a sign that the measures are working. The last confirmed locally transmitted case of the virus in Wuhan was on Monday.  \n With the United States, Italy and Spain and other countries now battling soaring infections, China is focussing on the risk posed by imported cases - most of them Chinese returning home.  \n Effective Saturday, China suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits.  \n  \n DISINFECTANT AND MASKS  \n But even with the decline in cases and loosening of restrictions, Wuhan authorities were taking few chances.  \n Staff, some in full-body protective gear, and volunteers bustled around the railway station in the morning, setting out hand disinfectant and putting up signs reminding travellers they need a mobile-phone based health code to take public transport.  \n A worker walked through one metro train carrying a signboard reading: \"Wear a mask for the entire journey, people should not gather and when you disembark please scan the health code.\"  \n \"Everyone is taking the right precautions. So, there shouldn’t be a problem,\" Yuan Hai, 30, a passenger on a reopened metro line said when asked about the risks. \"But you have to be careful.\"  \n The existence of an unknown number of asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus in China has raised concerns among the public that lifting the restrictions may release thousands of people who could still be spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, without knowing they are sick.  \n Life in Wuhan remains far from normal. The vast majority of shops are shut while bright yellow roadblocks remain. Wuhan will not let people leave the city until April 8.  \n Some people at the railway station, such as a woman who only gave her surname as Zhang, said they were there to see if there was any chance people could leave earlier.  \n Her grandson came to visit her for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday in January and has been separated from his parents in the southern city of Shenzhen ever since. With schools there possibly reopening, she hopes he can get back soon.  \n \"He was supposed to leave on the fifth day (of the holiday) but has now been here for a few months,\" she said.

Russia has faced numerous rounds of Western sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. \n The world's 20 most industrialised countries are scrambling to defend their virus-wracked economies amid forecasts they will likely plunge into a recession. \n On Wednesday, the financial ratings agency Moody's estimated the G20's overall gross domestic product would contract by 0.5 percent this year, with the US economy shrinking by 2.0 percent and the eurozone by 2.2 percent. \n 'NOT ENOUGH' \n \"The G20 declaration on the Covid-19 pandemic is a document of global resolve,\" said Markus Engels, from the Global Solutions Initiative, a network of think tanks. \n \"The lesson the G20 leaders take away from their meeting should be that social and international solidarity must once again be acknowledged as the most important instrument for combating the crisis.\" \n But amid warnings that tens of millions of lives could be lost to the virus globally, international aid agency Oxfam said the G20 action was \"not enough\". \n \"The world's richest governments are still only warming up to the scale of the task,\" said Chema Vera, Oxfam's interim executive director. \n \"G20 leaders must set a truly ambitious plan... to save lives, including a massive injection of funds into public health around the globe.\" \n This week, Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping pushed for an emergency G20 summit to limit the impact of the pandemic. \n The lack of immediate action stood in contrast to the 2008 financial crisis, when the group quickly swung into action to mobilise assistance for vulnerable countries. \n 'PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO' \n Talk of global coordination has yet to resonate under Trump's isolationist presidency. \n On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took aim at China, saying the top diplomats of the Group of Seven agreed with him that Beijing was waging a \"disinformation\" campaign about the pandemic. \n At the G7 talks, a day before the G20 summit, Pompeo alleged Beijing was engaged in a social media campaign that included conspiracy theories centering on the US being behind the virus, which was first detected in the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan.  \n The G7 failed to agree on a joint declaration amid Pompeo's insistence on labelling the coronavirus as the \"Wuhan virus\", US media reported. \n \"The US has provided a perfect example of what not to do as the country pushes its 'US-first' ideology to the extreme,\" said Engels. \n Crude oil prices  hammered by the coronavirus outbreak's impact on demand as well as by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia — were also expected to be at the centre of the discussions. \n Riyadh faces pressure from Washington to row back on its decision to hike production and offer the biggest price cuts in two decades, in retaliation for Russia's refusal to tighten supply as the virus sapped demand. \n On Wednesday, Pompeo urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to \"rise to the occasion\" and \"reassure global energy and financial markets\". \n However, the Kremlin said \"the oil topic\" was off the table.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective. Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?  \n There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums.  \n \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information centre at Arizona-based Banner Health.

        "news_content_translate_en": "TORONTO - Canada's health system is preparing for an influx of coronavirus patients in the midst of a long-running bed shortage, calling doctors out of retirement and ramping down any treatment that can wait.  \n A shortage of beds during periods of peak demand, like the flu season, is a longstanding problem in the publicly funded system. While health spending has risen gradually in recent years, beds have not kept pace with population growth.  \n \"You've got people in broom closets and auditoriums and conference rooms across the country,\" said Michael Gardam, chief of staff at one Ontario's newest hospitals, the 656-bed Humber River Hospital.  \n Canada has 925 cases of the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, and 12 deaths.  \n A preliminary model published by Canadian researchers this week estimated that if cases increase by 7.5 percent each day, Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, will run out of ICU beds and ventilators in about 37 days. [https://www.covid-19-mc.ca/]  \n Between Sunday and Thursday, daily case counts grew an average of 16% a day.  \n In British Columbia, which has seen the most virus-linked deaths in Canada, the majority of hospitals are running between 110% and 140% of their official capacity, said Christine Sorensen, president of the BC Nurses' Union.  \n Most current Canadian hospitals were built between the 1940-1960s, under a federal program. Budget cuts forced closures, and in recent years, growing demand for long-term care has further strained the system.  \n Canada had 12.9 adult intensive care beds per 100,000 people, according to a study based on 2013-14 data, with variations across the country. British Columbia had only 10.5 beds, and the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador had 21.8, according to a report from Canadian Institute for Health Information.  \n Quebec's government recently said it has 1,000 ICU beds, or 11.8 per 100,000.  \n In contrast, the United States had 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 as of 2009, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information.  \n  \n CARE BY EMAIL AND IN HOTELS  \n With little time left to prepare, officials are moving to make the most of what they have.  \n British Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons put a call out to doctors who retired in the last two years to re-register under a special emergency class.  \n Ontario told hospitals this week to ramp down elective surgeries and non-urgent treatment. It also said it would invest C$100 million (£60.01 million) to increase capacity, but it is not clear how quickly that can be done.  \n An Ontario committee set up to address the crisis is looking at how to move more patients out of hospitals and into long-term care or home with care, a document obtained by Reuters showed.  \n Alberta is enabling doctors to bill for phone consultations, in an effort to keep patients at home.  \n Its College of Physicians and Surgeons told doctors that unregulated technology, like email and texting, may be justified under the \"extraordinary circumstances.\"  \n Some hospitals have the capacity to re-open beds that have been closed over the years, said Michael Hurley, president of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, but that is not occurring quickly enough.  \n \"So far we haven't talked about approaching this virus with the intensity that the Chinese have,\" said Hurley, citing China's move to open up thousands of hospital beds in a matter of days to handle the influx of coronavirus patients. China assembled new hospitals in Wuhan using prefabricated buildings.  \n One top priority will be protecting healthcare workers, for their own safety and so they can continue to see patients.  \n \"It's going to be a burden on the staff; it's going to be a burden on the system,\" said Paul-Émile Cloutier, president of hospital advocacy group HealthCareCAN.  \n \"The challenges of COVID-19 underscore the challenges that already exist in the system.\" REUTERS \n ",

I am now in self-isolation, but I will continue to lead the government's response to this videoconferencing virus. Together we'll get through this. Johnson confirmed on Twitter. This was one of the first news that opened another day of pandemic coverage.\nUS President Donald Trump spoke on the phone with the British Prime Minister, wishing him a \"speedy recovery\". Trump also spoke to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, who both decided to work together to combat the virus. Already before the Chinese leader had said that both countries must unite against the pandemic. The US President also spoke to the French head of state in what Emmanuel Macron described as \"a very good conversation\". Without going into detail, Macron has ensured that \"an important initiative\" is being prepared with Trump.\nThis was the day the United States crossed the barrier of the 100-thousand infected people and Trump invoked the Protection Act to force General Motors to produce fans. This Friday was also news that Washington is donating 210 million dollars (more than 190 million euros) to 64 of the most affected countries.\nItaly is undoubtedly one of the most affected countries at a time when sad records are being broken every day: in 24-hour, 969 people have died and there are already more infected than China.

The government will also prohibit gatherings of more than 100 people and cancel large events and celebrations, he said.  \n \"It is concerning we are now dealing with internal transmission of the virus.

Oh, what the hell. I don't think there is any business that is greater than the value of human life. We just can't mess with the economy. We have to take care of everyone today to then restore the economy.\nLet's be clear. Nobody can cope with a pandemic like this on their own. There are no resources. There's no way. Portugal is no exception. Portugal already had many problems in our National Health Service (SNS) before Covid-19. We are not prepared, or less so to test the SNS response peak, the fans, the machines, do not multiply, much less the health professionals, whose shoulders will carry weights that will test their limits, such as China and Italy have already shown uYeah.\nHowever, not being prepared cannot mean standing idly by and waiting for danger. No, we can't. For exceptional periods, responses must be exceptional. Yeah, we need to be home. Yes, we need to realize that this is no joking matter, to go to the beach or simply ignore the gravity of the contagion facility problem. In the life of society, the unconsciousness of some can, in a literal sense, endanger the lives of others, especially those of the most vulnerable.\nThat's why we need strong leadership and authority. We can't play governors. It's not enough to play statesman. We need people with fiber and a pulse to make tough, unpopular, but necessary decisions. We don't need politics. We cannot be held hostage by seemingly technical opinions, because in these public health measures the technician becomes inseparable from the politician. Italy is a dramatic example. It's over there. To observe, learn and correct answers.\nAnd this is also a defining moment. Where is the European Union? What's your answer? Years and years of building Europe, of bureaucratic institutions and when we have a global problem, it is every man for himself. This is what it feels like, very little cooperation and solidarity. And this will have economic and political consequences up ahead. But up ahead, we all want to be alive. Living also to evaluate the answers that our political decision-makers have given us, that time will come to take stock, to make the assessments, but after the fire has turned to ashes. Living to rebuild a world that's all connected and that shows us that there's no one immune in a situation like this. Rich and poor, West and East. We are all in the same boat, humanity, just like the planet where we live, is one.\nI think there is no greater fear than death or watching our own perish. And that should be our focus. Then, with health care, with all patients treated, we must rebuild a global economyYeah. We still can't account for the two-week damage at home, especially when we don't even know if it's only gonna be 15 days or more. It will be dramatic for commerce, catering, hospitality and other services. Yes,ma'am. I'm afraid so. The tourism sector is devastated by the cancellations. Many factories will have to stop or work well below their capacity. But we urgently need to clamp this thing down so we can get back to the terraces, the restaurants, the shopping centres and the beaches. Without a vaccine, without effective anti-virus suppression of COVID-19 we are left with, as epidemiologist Peter Piot (one of the researchers who discovered Ebola) called them, \"medieval methods of containment: isolation, quarantine and contact mapping\".\nFuck the economy, people's safety comes first. It takes courage",

Carnivals are held across the region, with pageants and dance parties as well as religious ceremonies.  \n Myanmar on Friday became the first to ban all mass gatherings to mark the Thingyan holiday – the most important event in the Theravada Buddhist year – over the fast-spreading coronavirus. Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand have also taken steps but have not introduced outright bans yet.  \n \"Since the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is easily contracted in crowded spots, citizens are not allowed to participate in events, festivals and celebrations for Myanmar’s traditional water festival,\" Myanmar’s presidential office said in a statement.  \n All such events and festivals will be banned until the end of April and possibly longer, it said.  \n The Thai government has urged the public not to organise big festivals and water fights, but to celebrate more traditionally at home with their families, pouring water on elderly people to ask for blessings and offering alms to monks.  \n Bangkok, which typically closes off streets in April for water fights, has called off Songkran activities to reduce of risk of an outbreak. The city has also asked businesses and malls to not hold activities including water fights.  \n Siam Piwat, which operates popular malls like Siam Paragon, said they would have smaller events to celebrate the culture of Songkran and not draw large gatherings.  \n The beach resort town of Patong in Phuket Isalnd, famous for its nightlife, has also cancelled Songkran events, which usually includes musical performances and dances.  \n Thailand on Friday had a total of 75 coronavirus cases.  \n Neighbouring Cambodia cancelled celebrations in Siem Reap, where the first Cambodian was confirmed to have fallen ill with the virus on Saturday, and Laos urged citizens to avoid mass gatherings in a statement on Wednesday.  \n An official from Luang Prabang told Radio Free Asia all public events to mark the new year in the city had been called off.  \n \"Only necessary traditional rituals will be allowed,\" the official said.  \n Despite close links with China, where the virus originated in Wuhan city, Southeast Asia has had fewer cases than other regions, though some fear they are going under-reported due to weak healthcare systems and lack of testing.  \n \"It is difficult to predict what will happen in Myanmar, but the global situation is not good,\" Kaung Sithu, the organizer of one big annual new year party in the commercial capital of Yangon told Reuters by phone.  \n \"Now is the time to be concerned, we do not want to be reckless and gather people.\" REUTERS \n ",

In Hubei Province, epicenter of the pandemic, it was the first time that the daily total was written with just one digit: 8.\nBy midnight on Wednesday (16h in Lisbon), the number of deaths in mainland China, excluding Macao and Hong Kong, rose in 11 to 3.169. In total, the country adds 80.793 infected.\nThe National Health Commission reported that 62.793 people were discharged after having overcome the disease to date and 14.831 remained in treatment.\nTen of the eleven deaths occurred in Hubei Province, an epicentre of the epidemic, where eight of the 15 new cases detected at national level also emerged.\nIn total, Hubei sums up three.056 deaths and 67.781 cases of infection, most of them worldwide.\nIn the last 24-hour period, six \"imported\" cases were detected from outside the country, including three in Guangdong Province, adjacent to Macao.\nMeanwhile, an investigation of the Chinese magazine Caixin reveals that the Chinese hospital where Li Wenliang worked, the first doctor who warned of the dangers of the new coronavirus, was the most affected by the outbreak because it concealed essential information.\nAmong the 4.000 employees working at Wuhan Central Hospital, 230 died from Covid-19 infection, the highest mortality rate among health workers in Wuhan, the Chinese city that is epicenter of the outbreak.\nThe head of one of the departments of the hospital mentioned by Caixin, one of China's rare independent publications, blamed the authorities for putting lives at riskYeah.\n\"The false information released by relevant departments [that the disease was controllable and not infectious among humans] left hundreds of doctors and nurses in the dark, who did everything in their power to treat patients without knowing the disease\", pointed out the person responsible, whose name is not identified by the Caixin.\n\"And even those who fell ill could not report it. They couldn't alert their colleagues and the public in time, despite the sacrifice. That is the most painful loss and lesson,\"he said.\nAccording to the magazine, the hospital had been overwhelmed by fever patients since early January. Several were taken care of doctors who were not specialized in contagious diseases.\nThe doctors cited by the Caixin blamed the administration for \"incompetence\".\nThe head of the Communist Party at the hospital had no knowledge of infectious diseases and forbade doctors from disclosing critical information to public health, he found the magazine.\nAn internal document from the Central Hospital obtained by the Caixin also revealed direct interference by the Wuhan municipal health authorities, which made it difficult for the hospital to disclose cases, especially between the 12th and 17th days of last January, when the local Communist Party cadres took part in the meetings of the local legislative body.\nAccording to Caixin, an official of the Ministry of Public Security visited the hospital on January 12th, and ordered the forms on infectious diseases to be filled in and reported only after consultations with experts at the municipal and provincial level, delaying the process.\nOn January 13th, Wang Wenyong, head of the infectious disease control office of Jianghan district in Wuhan, called the hospital and asked that suspected reports of infection with the new coronavirus, filed in January 10th, be amended to show other diseases in the fileYeah.\nIn response, the hospital asked the district health authorities to collect samples, but they were told to stand by. The wait lasted three days.\nIn January 16, after the meetings of the local legislature were completed, the disease control centre of the city of Wuhan was finally collecting samples. At the time, the hospital had 48 suspicious cases.\nThe new revelations illustrate how the Wuhan authorities acted to suppress information on the disease, which has already caused four.500 deaths and infected over 124 thousand people in a hundred countries and territories",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SEOUL — South Korea summoned Japan's envoy on Friday (March 6) to protest against its neighbour's decision to quarantine South Korean visitors for two weeks, and threatened retaliation, as the bid to rein in a coronavirus ignited a new row, following a trade spat last year. \n Japan is among almost 100 nations to impose curbs on travellers from South Korea, which has suffered 42 deaths and 6,593 infections in the biggest outbreak outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. \n It has barred entry to visitors from highly affected areas in South Korea, and ordered two weeks in quarantine for others. \n \"If the Japanese government does not withdraw their decision... we cannot help but devise necessary countermeasures, including reciprocal measures,\" Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha told Japanese ambassador Koji Tomita. \n She condemned Japan's decision to impose the quarantine without sufficient consultation or prior notice, despite Seoul's efforts to persuade it against travel restrictions. \n \"We express deep regret towards the unjust measures taken by the Japanese government,\" Ms Kang added. \n She held a separate briefing for some 100 mask-wearing diplomats stationed in Seoul later on Friday on South Korea’s prevention efforts. \n Speaking through a translator, Mr Tomita responded that Ms Kang should be well aware of the worsening situation. \n \"The next two weeks are a critical time period that will determine whether or not we can put an end to Covid-19,\" the Japanese ambassador said, referring to the illness caused by the virus, which first emerged in China late last year. \n Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters in Tokyo that the quarantine instructions, which would also apply to visitors from China, would take the form of a request for them to stay in their hotels. \n \"This is a request, we'll do everything to make sure people understand,\" he said. \n Seoul has earlier protested to the envoys of Southeast Asian neighbours Singapore and Vietnam over similar curbs. \n Tokyo faced \"mistrust from the international community due to its opaque, passive\" response to the coronavirus outbreak, the National Security Council (NSC) said after a meeting at the presidential Blue House earlier in the day. \n \"We will explore necessary countermeasures based on principles of reciprocity,\" it said in a statement. \n Japan's chief government spokesman defended the travel restrictions. \n \"The decision was the result of a comprehensive review of the information available about the situation in other countries and the effects of other measures,\" said Mr Yoshihide Suga. \n \"I think the timing is appropriate.\" \n The number of coronavirus cases in Japan stood at around 1,060 as of Friday evening, with new infections reported from Yamaguchi prefecture in the southwest to Hokkaido in the north, according to national broadcaster NHK. \n The rapid spread of the disease has raised doubts about whether Tokyo will be able to host the Olympics this summer, but the government has insisted in recent days that the Games will go-ahead as scheduled. \n NUMBER OF NEW CASES FALL \n The number of new cases of the flu-like virus fell to 505 in South Korea on Friday, from 760 the previous day, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. \n Vice-Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said authorities had almost finished tests on more than 200,000 followers of a church in southeastern Daegu city at the centre of the outbreak. \n More than 90 per cent of South Korea's infections were in Daegu and nearby North Gyeongsang province. Smaller clusters elsewhere include a new one reported on Friday at a hospital in Seongnam, southeast of the capital. \n The number of South Korean visitors to Japan fell nearly 26 per cent last year to 5.6 million, the first drop since Japan's tsunami and nuclear disaster in 2011, Japanese tourism officials say. \n Difficult relations between Japan and South Korea date from the former's occupation of the Korean peninsula from 1910 to 1945. Last year Tokyo slapped trade curbs on South Korea, which responded with a boycott on Japanese goods and services. REUTERS \n ",

In the United States, for instance, Indian imports accounted for 24 percent of medicines and 31 percent of medicine ingredients in 2018, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  \n FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn told U.S. senators on Tuesday that the agency is working to determine how the restrictions will affect the U.S. medical supply and the effect on essential medicines.  \n The FDA last week announced the first coronavirus-related drug shortage in the United States but declined to name the drug in question. Hahn said on Tuesday that drug was in shortage because of a lack of materials needed to make the API.  \n Indian drugmakers rely on China, the source of the virus outbreak, for almost 70% of the APIs for their medicines. Industry experts say they are likely to face shortages if the epidemic drags on.  \n \"Export of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs... is hereby 'restricted' with immediate effect and till further orders,\" the Director General of Foreign Trade said in a statement https://dgft.gov.in/sites/default/files/Noti%2050_0.pdf on Tuesday, without explaining the extent of the restrictions.  \n \"Irrespective of the ban, some of these molecules may face shortages for the next couple of months,\" Dinesh Dua, chairman of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India, told Reuters. The council falls under the federal commerce ministry.  \n \"If coronavirus is not contained, then in that case there could be acute shortages,\" Dua said.  \n In a statement, the Indian federal government said state authorities had been asked to monitor the production and availability of APIs and formulations to prevent black marketing and hoarding.  \n U.S. drugmakers have said they are monitoring their supply chains and Mylan NV <MYL.O> warned last week that there could be drug shortages. Eli Lilly and Co <LLY.N> said on Tuesday it does not expect the coronavirus outbreak to result in shortages for any of its therapies, including insulin products.  \n  \n INDIA MONITORING PATIENTS  \n Separately, the Indian government said on Tuesday it had detected \"high viral load\" in six people who had been in contact with a patient who contracted the virus in New Delhi, the capital.  \n The patient in New Delhi was being monitored and was stable, the government said.  \n The six people have been kept in isolation and their samples are being sent to India's National Institute of Virology for confirmation, the government said in a statement https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1604938.  \n Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to quell public fears.  \n \"There is no need to panic,\" he said in a tweet.  \n \"Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus.

        "news_content_translate_en": "GENEVA/BEIJING - The new coronavirus appears to now be spreading much more rapidly outside China than within, and airports in hard-hit countries were ramping up screening of travellers.  \n World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said almost eight times as many cases had been reported outside China as inside in the previous 24 hours, adding that the risk of coronavirus spreading was now very high at a global level.  \n At a briefing in Geneva, he said outbreaks in South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan were the greatest concern, but that there was evidence that close surveillance was working in South Korea, the worst affected country outside China, and the epidemic could be contained there.  \n U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said that within 12 hours, airports across South Korea and Italy will screen all travellers for coronavirus. Pence, who has been put in charge of the U.S. response to the outbreak, also said U.S. travel restrictions may expand.  \n The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said U.S. industry expects to have the capacity to perform 1 million coronavirus tests by the end of the week.  \n The global death toll exceeded 3,000, with the number of dead in Italy jumping by 18 to 52. Latvia, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Morocco reported cases for the first time, bringing the total to more than 60 countries with the illness known as COVID-19.  \n But equity markets surged after their worst plunge since the 2008 financial crisis last week, encouraged by the prospect of government action to stem the economic impact. In the United States, the Dow jumped nearly 1,300 points, or 5%, while the S&P 500 closed 4.6% higher.  \n Finance ministers of the G7 group of leading industrialised democracies were expected to discuss measures in a conference call on Tuesday, sources told Reuters.  \n Oil prices jumped 4% amid hopes of a deeper output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  \n  \n (Graphic: Tracking the coronavirus https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html)  \n  \n MORE THAN PREDICTED  \n A senior U.S. official said he was concerned about a likely jump in the number of cases in the United States, which has had more than 90, with six deaths. More testing will almost surely lead to more confirmed cases.  \n \"When you have a number of cases that you've identified and they've been in the community for a while, you're going to wind up seeing a lot more cases than you would have predicted,\" Dr Anthony Fauci, head of the infectious diseases unit at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, told CNN.  \n South Korea has had 26 deaths and reported another 599 infections on Monday, taking its tally to 4,335.  \n Of the new cases in South Korea, 377 were from the city of Daegu. That is home to a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, to which most of South Korea's cases have been traced after some members visited the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the disease emerged.  \n The Seoul government asked prosecutors to launch a murder investigation into leaders of the church. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said that if founder Lee Man-hee and other heads of the church had cooperated, fatalities could have been prevented.  \n Lee knelt and apologised to the country, saying that one church member had infected many others and calling the epidemic a \"great calamity\".  \n It was not immediately known how many of South Korea's dead were members of the church.  \n  \n 'OUTBREAKS ARE CURBED'  \n But Wuhan itself, at the centre of the epidemic, shut the first of 16 specially built hospitals that were hurriedly put up to treat coronavirus cases, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said.  \n There was also a steep fall in new cases in Hubei, the province around Wuhan, but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries.  \n The virus broke out in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, mostly in China.  \n Only eight cases were reported in China beyond Hubei on Sunday, the WHO said.  \n China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun at a news conference said: “We definitely believe that with the coming of spring we’re not far from the coming of the victory of the final defeat of COVID-19.”  \n Outside China, there are now more than 8,700 infected and over 125 deaths.  \n Iran, one of the worst-hit nations, reported infections rising to 1,501, with 66 deaths, including a senior official. With stocks of gloves and other medical supplies running low in pharmacies, authorities uncovered a hoard of supplies including millions of gloves.  \n In Britain, which has 40 confirmed cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to be prepared for a further spread.  \n (For more coverage of the coronavirus, see https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484) REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Certain mathematical models for simulating financial markets are similar to those for studying epidemics. \n We know this because we are two financial modellers who have been involved in modelling epidemics for public health authorities. \n Here, we would like to do our bit for public education on the Covid-19 outbreak by explaining five concepts from epidemiology, which is the study of how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why.  \n The hope is that when the public is better able to understand what information about Covid-19 is shared, it will minimise irrational fear. \n KEY STATISTICS \n The media has been reporting on the number of newly infected and deaths cases daily. What is equally important is the number of recoveries, which is infrequently reported by the media. \n Imagine this: There are 10 newly infected and three deaths one day. This sounds terrible, but if eight people recover on that day, then there is a net “exit” of one patient (3+8-10) from the pool. \n In any epidemic, perhaps the most important indicator is whether the net pool is increasing or decreasing. \n Another helpful statistic is the growth factor, which is each day's new cases divided by new cases from the previous day.   \n The growth factor computed from total cases reported (worldwide) was mostly below one from Feb 13 to 19, but surged back to mostly above one from Feb 20 until now, as infections began spreading rapidly beyond China to other countries. \n Sophisticated models should also consider relevant country-level statistics, such as population, density, travel frequencies, medical resources available per capita and spare capacities in health systems to cope with infectious diseases.  \n EPIDEMIC PYRAMID \n The typical classifications in an epidemic pyramid are death, severe, mild and asymptomatic, as follows:  \n  \n Learning from their Sars outbreak experience in 2003, Singapore and Taiwan have resources and operating procedures in place to reach deep down the pyramid to trace every (asymptomatic) case possible even before symptoms are shown.   \n But let’s be realistic. No matter how effective the screening process is, there will be misdiagnosis. \n Initial statistics collected from any outbreak almost always understate the full burden.  \n For example, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially estimated 12,469 deaths for the H1N1 virus in the US from April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010. But by 2019, it increased its estimate for that period to at least 75,000 deaths, or six times the earlier figure. \n Initial observed fatality statistics can be used to project the full burden with data that may take months or even years to arrive. This is called a cross-sectional problem because we take one cross section of the pyramid to make an educated guess on the size of a deeper cross section of the pyramid.  \n Case fatality rate is the number of deaths over a defined period of time divided by the number of individuals diagnosed with the disease during that time.  \n This is a different problem by focusing on the time dimension. As long as epidemic models are careful in drawing conclusions from data already available at specific time points, they can still provide helpful insights. \n TOCC (TRAVEL, OCCUPATION, CONTACT, CLUSTER) TRACING \n Some countries may be too big in physical size. Many lack the resources to test and diagnose every suspected case.  \n Moreover, many patients avoid seeking medical help until they show severe symptoms. As a result, we have to assume that a portion of undiagnosed patients may still be infecting others in the overall population.  \n As long as there is a way to perform TOCC tracing from the diagnosed cases, there is a path to slow down the spread of infections.  \n Public health officials worry the most about infections from unknown sources — also known as the silent patients — in which contacts cannot be back-traced easily.  \n When the silent patients include say a taxi driver, he or she may have infected some passengers with no easy way to trace all related passengers riding his/her taxi.  \n That is how epidemic control can become extremely challenging.  \n Those were the worrying signs observed in the early stages in Wuhan and Hubei, and perhaps we are noticing similar patterns emerging in Japan, South Korea, Iran and Italy.   \n TREATMENTS \n From an epidemiological point of view, patients are removed from the pool by either recoveries or deaths.  \n The human body does have natural mechanisms to rid itself of viruses including the Covid-19 virus, but that is not always successful before the onset of other fatal complications.  \n Therefore, the medical goal is to increase recoveries by treatments and to decrease deaths. \n Certain treatments such as antibody therapy have been around since the 1970s. The issues are what dosage to use for which types of patients, and whether there are any potential side effects.  \n Safe vaccines may take many months to develop by clinical trials.  \n In a public health emergency such as the outbreak in Wuhan, public health authorities may choose to bypass lengthy clinical trial procedures, but it is unwise if shortcuts are taken everywhere.    \n EPIDEMIC MODELS \n Epidemiologists describe the dynamics of how a disease is spread with mathematical models to better predict the effectiveness of disease control measures using “before and after” analyses. \n Impactful epidemic models require: 1) reasonable and transparent data as model parameters, or the entire exercise will become “garbage in, garbage out”; 2) a research environment where model results can be discussed openly to focus time and energy on the roughly correct models.  \n There is a legitimate policy concern that raw data may be prone to misinterpretations by potentially faulty analyses, creating unnecessary fear among the public. \n Discussions among responsible scientists can take place in a “moderated” but still expedited forum (such as on the medRxiv server co-hosted by Yale) to encourage participation and to minimise unnecessary overreactions to preliminary results. \n This way, “scientifically credible” clinical data can be released in a much shorter timeframe than the typical journal peer review process to allow other scientists to begin accessing the data, creating a win-win solution to address both scientific and public policy concerns. \n We encourage everyone with a good grasp of these concepts to review the primary sources instead of relying solely on secondary sources to interpret the statistics.  \n For example, a recent report by the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre and the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London shows the estimates of the overall case fatality ratio in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of Covid-19 to be approximately 1 per cent.  \n The confidence range is from 0.5 per cent to 4 per cent. At the low end of the range or 0.5 per cent, Covid-19 is a low fatality but highly infectious disease like a terrible influenza, but public health officials may need to consider additional measures at the high end of the range or 4 per cent.  \n Armed with better understanding of information shared, the public will be more prepared until effective vaccines and treatments become widely available.  \n   \n ABOUT THE AUTHORS: \n Anthony G Constantinides is Professor of Communications and Signal Processing of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and heads the Financial Signal Processing Lab at Imperial College London. Imperial alumnus Dr Bernard Lee is Founder and CEO of financial analytics firm HedgeSPA and author of Investment Analytics in the Dawn of Artificial Intelligence. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "模拟金融市场的某些数学模型与研究流行病的模型相似。\n我们之所以知道这一点，是因为我们是两位金融建模者，曾参与为公共卫生当局建模流行病。\n在这里，我们想通过解释流行病学的五个概念来为关于Covid-19爆发的公共教育做一点贡献，流行病学是研究疾病在不同人群中发生的频率和原因的\n希望当公众能够更好地理解关于Covid-19的哪些信息被共享时，它能将非理性的恐惧降到最低。\n主要统计数据\n媒体每天都在报道新感染和死亡病例的数量。同样重要的是回收次数，媒体很少报道。\n想象一下：一天有10名新感染者和3名死亡者。这听起来很可怕，但如果8人在那一天康复，那么就有一名患者（3+8-10）从游泳池中净“退出”。\n在任何流行病中，可能最重要的指标是净池是增加还是减少。\n另一个有用的统计数据是生长因子，它是每天的新病例除以前一天的新病例。 \n从2月13日至19日（全球范围内）报告的病例总数计算得出的增长因子大多低于1，但从2月20日到现在，随着感染开始迅速蔓延到中国以外的其他国家，增长因子又飙升至大多高于1。\n复杂的模型还应考虑国家一级的相关统计数据，如人口、密度、旅行频率、人均可用医疗资源以及卫生系统应付传染病的剩余能. \n流行病金字塔\n流行病金字塔中的典型分类是死亡、严重、轻微和无症状，具体如下：\n新加坡和台湾从2003年非典爆发的经验中吸取教训，拥有足够的资源和操作程序，可以深入金字塔深处，甚至在症状出现之前追踪每一个可能的（无症状的）病例。 \n但要现实一点，不管筛查过程有多有效，都会出现误诊。\n从任何疫情中收集的初步统计数据几乎总是低估了全部负担\n例如，美国疾病控制和预防中心最初估计，2009年4月12日至2010年4月10日，美国死于H1N1病毒的人数为12469人。但到2019年，它将这一时期的死亡人数估计增加到至少75000人，是先前数字的6倍。\n最初观察到的死亡统计数据可用于预测可能需要数月甚至数年才能到达的数据的全部负担。这称为横截面问题，因为我们取金字塔的一个横截面来对金字塔较深横截面的大小进行有根据的猜测\n病死率是指在规定时间内死亡的人数除以在此期间被诊断患有该疾病的人数\n这是一个关注时间维度的不同问题。只要流行病模型在从特定时间点已有的数据中谨慎地得出结论，它们仍然可以提供有用的见解。\nTOCC（旅行、职业、联系、集群）追踪\n有些国家的实际规模可能太大。许多人缺乏检测和诊断每一个疑似病例的资源\n此外，许多病人在出现严重症状之前都避免寻求医疗帮助。因此，我们不得不假设一部分未确诊的病人可能仍在感染其他. \n只要有办法从确诊病例中进行TOCC追踪，就有办法减缓感染的蔓延\n公共卫生官员最担心的是来自未知来源的感染，也被称为沉默的病人，在这种情况下，接触者很难追溯\n当沉默的患者包括出租车司机时，他或她可能已经感染了一些乘客，无法轻易地追踪所有乘坐他/她的出租车的相关乘客\n这就是流行病控制如何变得极具挑战性的原因\n这些是武汉和湖北早期观察到的令人担忧的迹象，也许我们注意到日本、韩国、伊朗和意大利也出现了类似的情况\n治疗\n从流行病学的角度来看，患者要么通过康复要么通过死亡被从游泳池中带走\n人体确实有清除病毒（包括Covid-19病毒）的自然机制，但在出现其他致命并发症之前，这并不总是成功的\n因此，医疗目标是通过治疗提高康复率并减少死亡。\n某些治疗方法，如抗体治疗，从20世纪70年代就开始出现了。问题是对哪种类型的病人使用什么剂量，以及是否有任何潜在的副作用\n通过临床试验，安全疫苗的研制可能需要几个月的时间\n在武汉爆发这样的突发公共卫生事件中，公共卫生当局可能会选择绕开冗长的临床试验程序，但如果到处走捷径，那是不明智的\n流行病模型\n流行病学家用数学模型描述疾病传播的动态，以便通过“前后”分析更好地预测疾病控制措施的效.\n有影响的流行病模型要求：1）以合理、透明的数据作为模型参数，否则整个研究过程将变成“垃圾输入、垃圾输出”；2）一个可以公开讨论模型结果的研究环境，将时间和精力集中在大致正确的模型上\n有一种合理的政策担心，原始数据可能容易被潜在的错误分析曲解，在公众中造成不必要的恐惧。\n负责任的科学家之间的讨论可以在一个“温和”但仍然快速的论坛（例如耶鲁大学共同主办的medRxiv服务器）上进行，以鼓励参与并尽量减少对初步结果不必要的过度反应。\n这样，“科学可信”的临床数据可以在比典型的期刊同行评审流程更短的时间内发布，以允许其他科学家开始访问数据，从而创建一个双赢的解决方案，解决科学和公共政策问题。\n我们鼓励每一个对这些概念有很好把握的人审查主要来源，而不是仅仅依靠次要来源来解释统计数字\n例如，世界卫生组织合作中心和伦敦帝国理工学院MRC全球传染病分析中心最近的一份报告显示，Covid-19所有感染（无症状或有症状）的总病死率估计约为1%\n置信区间在0.5%至4%之间，在区间的低端或0.5%范围内，Covid-19是一种死亡率低但传染性强的疾病，类似于可怕的流感，但公共卫生官员可能需要考虑在区间的高端或4%范围内采取额外措施\n随着对共享信息的更好理解，公众将更加做好准备，直到有效的疫苗和治疗被广泛使. \n \n关于作者：\nAnthony G Constantinides是电气与电子工程系通信与信号处理教授，伦敦帝国理工学院金融信号处理实验室负责人。帝国理工大学校友Bernard Lee博士是金融分析公司HedgeSPA的创始人兼首席执行官，《黎明投资分析》的作者人工智能",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — For six months from March 2, companies in the manufacturing and services sectors will be able to hire work permit holders from China who are already in Singapore, without having to wait for them to exit the country first. \n Right now, the law allows companies in these two sectors to hire Chinese work permit holders only after they have left Singapore. This is because when work pass holders leave a company, their work permit must be cancelled and they must leave the country, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) stated on its website.  \n MOM said in a statement on Tuesday (Feb 25) that it has partnered the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) to introduce this temporary measure to give companies in the two sectors more flexibility to manage their manpower needs amid the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak.  \n “Companies facing a shortage of manpower can save on search and recruitment expenses. At the same time, companies that have excess manpower can provide their workers with an opportunity to continue working in Singapore and save on repatriation costs,” it said. \n MOM and SBF will facilitate the transfer of Chinese work permit holders between companies in the same sector. \n Companies in the construction, process and marine sectors are already allowed to hire such workers before they exit Singapore. The latest move extends the scheme to manufacturing and service companies. \n SBF's chief executive officer Ho Meng Kit said: “This initiative will benefit all parties — companies that require additional workers to meet their business needs, companies that are looking to release their workers, and workers who find themselves displaced due to the Covid-19 outbreak.” \n Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, assistant director-general of the National Trades Union Congress, said that there are some small- and medium-sized enterprises that have a surplus of manpower now and other companies who have workers who are unable to return to China. \n “We are also mindful that some of these workers may still be paying off their loans, so this move would give them a chance to continue to work,” he added. \n The scheme is extended to all companies in the manufacturing and services sector, and not just to SBF members.  \n Interested companies can approach SBF and it will help employers looking to release their Chinese work permit holders connect with other employers who are experiencing a shortage of manpower.  \n Companies can only hire or transfer existing Chinese work permit holders within the same sector.  \n Should a connection be made, SBF will inform MOM and the hiring company can submit a work permit application to the ministry.  \n Mr Jack Wong, chief financial officer of engineering and skill training firm Wong Fong Industries, said that his company would ”definitely” be tapping the scheme, but said that he would still face the challenge of training new workers in a short span of time.  \n The firm has 13 Chinese work permit holders still in China, out of a total of close to 300 workers, who are primarily Chinese nationals and Malaysians. Though he cannot provide any figures, he told reporters on Tuesday that the company “does feel a drop” in production.  \n “(The scheme) helps in the overall management of the business. But of course, you will take some time to bring these (new) workers up to speed.”  \n He said that it can take at least three months to train a worker from the same industry, which would eat into the duration of the six-month scheme.  \n “Those from the same sector, if they are trained properly, they will need less (time to train), but there are certain skill sets they still need to conform to, such as safety.”  \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON - The Trump administration is asking Congress for $2.5 billion to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus, including more than $1 billion for vaccines, the White House said on Monday.  \n With financial markets falling on concerns that the virus will have a significant impact on the global economy, the Trump administration is eager to show it is prepared to combat the virus despite the limited number of cases so far in the United States.  \n The virus has spread to some 29 countries and territories beyond mainland China, with outbreaks in South Korea, Iran and Italy. [L3N2AO07M]  \n \"The Trump administration continues to take the spread of the COVID-19 Coronavirus Disease very seriously. Today, the administration is transmitting to Congress a $2.5 billion supplemental funding plan to accelerate vaccine development, support preparedness and response activities and to procure much needed equipment and supplies,\" said Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.  \n The money will be used for therapeutics, vaccine development and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks, the White House said.  \n Of the $2.5 billion request, $1.5 billion represents new funding. The rest would come from funds already budgeted by Congress, such as unused money to fight the Ebola virus. The administration requires congressional approval to redirect that money to fight the coronavirus.  \n House of Representatives Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a Democrat, said in a statement the Trump administration's funding request was \"woefully insufficient to protect Americans from the deadly coronavirus outbreak.\"  \n House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said late on Monday that the supplemental funding requested by Trump is \"undersized\" and \"completely inadequate to the scale of this emergency\".  \n \"The House will swiftly advance a strong, strategic funding package that fully addresses the scale and seriousness of this public health crisis,\" Pelosi said in a statement.  \n The United States has not seen the virus spread through its communities the way that China and other countries have experienced, but health officials are preparing for the possibility even as Americans affected so far have been quarantined.  \n There have been 53 confirmed U.S. cases of the new coronavirus so far - 14 in people diagnosed in the United States and 39 among Americans repatriated from the outbreak's epicentre of Wuhan, China, and from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \n  \n TRAVEL WARNING  \n U.S. health officials have warned that cases among repatriated citizens will likely increase.  \n The CDC warned Americans on Monday to avoid travel to South Korea because of the virus.  \n \"We have aggressively worked to combat the spread of this virus, tried to prevent it as best we could from coming into this country,\" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters earlier on Monday.  \n Trump has been at odds with his own White House advisers over China's coronavirus response. He has sought to downplay the impact of the virus, saying it could fade in April with warmer weather - something health experts said is unknown.  \n Trump has praised the work of Chinese President Xi Jinping, even as his advisers have questioned the reliability of the information Beijing has shared on the virus and expressed frustration over its reluctance to accept U.S. expertise in combating it.  \n The Trump administration is also grappling with where to send Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess who tested positive for the virus after backing off plans to quarantine them in a federal facility in Alabama.  \n In a statement on Monday, HHS cited a \"rapidly evolving situation,\" but said the Alabama centre was \"not needed at this time\" and that it was looking for alternatives.

Both have passed away,\" said Mr Alireza Vahabzadeh. \n QUARANTINE HOSPITALS READIED \n Qom is a centre for Islamic studies attracting scholars from Iran and beyond. \n However, the head of the health ministry's contagious diseases unit said the pair who died were Qom residents who were not known to have left Iran. \n \"These two were from Qom and visited (us) two days ago after falling ill... they didn't even have a history of going abroad,\" IRNA quoted Mohammad Mehdi Gouya as saying. \n Another official in Qom said people suspected of being infected with the coronavirus would be put into quarantine in two hospitals. \n Mr Mohammadreza Ghadir, head of the city's medical sciences unit, told IRNA that \"the spread of coronavirus in Qom has been controlled and we want the people not to worry about it.\" \n The new coronavirus has now claimed the lives of eight people outside mainland China. \n One has died in Japan, one in Taiwan, another in the Philippines and two in Hong Kong. One has also died in France. \n The United Arab Emirates last month became the first country in the Middle East to report cases of the coronavirus strain.  \n Egypt has also reported cases. \n Iran's health sector has been hit by sanctions imposed by the United States since Washington withdrew in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal between the Islamic republic and world powers.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI/TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. - More than 300 American cruise liner passengers, including 14 who tested positive for coronavirus, were flown home to military bases in the United States, after two weeks under quarantine off Japan.  \n The cruise ship Diamond Princess, with more than 400 cases by far the largest cluster outside China, has become the biggest test so far of other countries' ability to contain an outbreak that has killed 1,770 people in China and five elsewhere.  \n Ground crew in anti-contamination suits met a chartered jet that touched down at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and passengers could be seen climbing down the stairs wearing face masks in the pre-dawn mist. Another flight landed at Travis Air Force Base in California hours earlier. Those arriving were taken into a two-week quarantine.  \n Although U.S. officials said passengers with coronavirus symptoms would not be taken, 14 passengers found at the last minute to have tested positive were permitted to board the planes. The U.S. State Department said the infected passengers were kept in isolation on the flights.  \n Across mainland China, officials said the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 2,048 to 70,548. That was slightly more new cases than were reported on Sunday, but hundreds fewer than reported on Saturday.  \n Chinese authorities say the stabilisation in the number of new cases is a sign that measures they have taken to halt the spread of the disease are having an effect.  \n However, epidemiologists say it is probably still too early to say how well the outbreak is being contained within China and its central Hubei province, where the virus first appeared. Official figures of new cases have levelled off in the past, only to jump suddenly after changes in methodology.  \n China has responded to the COVID-19 virus by locking down Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, a megacity of 11 million people, and imposing restrictions in a number of other cities.  \n But the ruling Communist Party is also under pressure to prevent the economy from crashing and get people back to work.  \n China's central bank cut the interest rate on its medium-term lending, a move that is expected to pave the way for a reduction in the benchmark loan prime rate on Thursday. Beijing has also announced plans for cuts in taxes and fees.  \n Even so, economists expect China's economic growth to slow. Ratings agency Moody's on Monday lowered its 2020 GDP growth forecast to 5.2%, making it likely China would miss a goal to double GDP over the decade to 2020.  \n  \n CRUISE SHIPS  \n Around half of all known cases of the virus outside China have been found aboard the Diamond Princess, where around 400 people have tested positive since the cruise liner was ordered to stay under quarantine off Japan on Feb. 3.  \n Several other countries have announced plans to follow the United States in bringing passengers home. Around half of the 3,700 passengers and crew are Japanese.  \n Matthew Smith, an American passenger who remained on the ship after refusing to board the voluntary repatriation flights, tweeted that staying behind was the \"best decision ever\".  \n \"US Gov't said they would not put anyone on the planes who was symptomatic, and they ended up knowingly and intentionally putting on 14 people who actually have the virus,\" he wrote.  \n Authorities around the world were also trying to track down passengers from another cruise liner, the Westerdam, which was turned away from ports across Southeast Asia for two weeks before docking in Cambodia on Thursday.  \n One American passenger who disembarked in Cambodia tested positive for the virus in Malaysia on Saturday.  \n Carnival Corp., which operates both cruise liners, said it was cooperating with authorities in trying to trace other passengers from the Westerdam. None of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew had reported any symptoms, it said.  \n \"Guests who have already returned home will be contacted by their local health department and be provided further information,\" a statement from the company's Holland America Line unit said. Hundreds of passengers are still in Cambodia, either on the ship or in hotels.  \n \"We will all be tested for the coronavirus today and tomorrow by the Cambodian Ministry of Health,\" said passenger Holley Rauen, a public health nurse and midwife from Fort Myers, Florida. \"We have no idea when we get to get home.\"  \n  \n CHINA BACK TO WORK?  \n After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China needs to get back to work or suffer severe economic consequences. There is a proposal to delay the opening of the annual session of parliament, due on Feb. 24.  \n Some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country. Many factories have yet to re-open, disrupting supply chains in China and beyond.  \n In Japan, where data showed on Monday that the economy had already shrunk last quarter at the fastest pace in almost six years, the impact of the virus is expected to show up in the current quarter, stoking fears of recession.  \n Trade-dependent Singapore downgraded its 2020 economic growth forecast and has said recession is possible. It is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow on Tuesday.  \n Organisers of the Tokyo Marathon have decided to limit the March 1 race to top-level athletes, banning 38,000 general participants, a person with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.  \n Japan's Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito's public birthday address on Feb. 23, his first since his coronation last year. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the Imperial Palace in the heart of Tokyo. REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK — The number of cases and deaths in the coronavirus epidemic in China jumped sharply Thursday (Feb 13) as the authorities there changed how they keep track of the illness, and not, primarily, because of any change in the shape of the outbreak. \n There is still a lot of uncertainty about the true numbers — as with any new epidemic — and that will continue for the foreseeable future. Underscoring that point, hours after China revised its figures, the World Health Organization (WHO) put out a lower set, saying that for now, it would not change the way it counts. \n But experts say there were good reasons for changing the way patients with the illness, called Covid-19, were counted, and the new approach should catch many cases that had been missed before. That will allow more patients to get treatment and be quarantined faster. \n Here is a look at what we know — and what we don’t — about the new coronavirus numbers and what they say about the scope of the crisis. \n HOW DID THE NUMBERS CHANGE? \n For several days, the Chinese government had reported figures that suggested the spread of the epidemic was slowing, but that changed abruptly Thursday. \n Officials in Hubei, the Chinese province that is the epicenter of the outbreak, said there had been more than 48,000 cases there, a 44 per cent jump from the day before. They also reported 1,310 deaths, a 23 per cent increase. The trend continued Friday, though not as markedly, when Hubei officials disclosed another 4,800 cases and 116 more deaths. \n Previously, cases were counted only if patients tested positive for the new virus. Now, the figures appear to include anyone who has a CT scan of the lungs showing a telltale pattern of pneumonia. \n In the short run, the new accounting may deepen confusion about the true size of the epidemic. It also complicates efforts to track the growth of the illness over the last several weeks. \n “We need to be careful in interpreting these numbers,” Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO emergency responses chief, said Thursday. The larger number of cases, he said, “does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak.” \n The WHO then released its own figures, leaving out the diagnoses made without a positive test for the virus — and indicating that it did not fully understand the change China had made. \n “For consistency, we report here only the number of laboratory-confirmed cases,” the organisation said in a situation report. “WHO has formally requested additional information on the clinically diagnosed cases, in particular when these have occurred in the course of the outbreak and whether suspect cases were reclassified as clinically diagnosed cases.” \n The WHO reported almost 47,000 confirmed cases worldwide, fewer than 1 per cent outside mainland China. The Chinese figures put the total at more than 61,000 cases. \n WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE OLD WAY? \n In a word, plenty. \n Kits to test for the virus are not being produced quickly enough to keep up with demand, and they take days to produce results. Using CT scans means more patients can be checked, with the results available almost immediately. \n And the tests for the virus have not been very reliable. Many sick people have tested negative, only to test positive later. That appears to be, at least in part, because standard testing involves swabbing nasal passages and the throat, while the virus may be lodged in the lungs. \n In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shipped hundreds of testing kits to state laboratories — and days later revealed that some of them were faulty. It is not clear whether China has experienced similar problems in making the tests. \n SO ARE THE NEW NUMBERS DEFINITIVE? \n No. \n There are several ways cases might still be missed. Some people get sick, and die or recover, without ever seeing a doctor. CT scans allow doctors to identify people whose infections have caused pneumonia, which can be fatal, but the scans will not catch people with milder symptoms. \n There is another source of confusion about the numbers. It was reported this week that China is no longer counting as confirmed cases people who test positive for the virus yet show no symptoms. But some experts said they were not sure what had actually changed. \n The Chinese health authorities say they can distinguish, on a CT scan, pneumonia brought on by the coronavirus from some other serious lung epidemics. But it is not clear that they can tell it from pneumonia caused by other illnesses, like seasonal influenza; the accuracy may vary with the skill of the doctor reading the scan. \n WILL WE EVENTUALLY GET MORE ACCURATE FIGURES? \n Quite possibly. \n Right now, labs are testing for the virus, itself, and viruses can be hard to detect. What is often easier to identify is the immune system's own response. \n When a patient contracts an infection, the body produces antibodies to it — proteins in the blood that recognise a particular pathogen and trigger an immune system attack on it. Labs around the world are working to develop a test for antibodies to the new coronavirus, but none is available yet. \n It could be tricky. \n There are several strains of coronavirus in humans, including ones that cause common colds, Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome). Antibodies to the new virus may be hard to distinguish from the antibodies people already have to other coronaviruses. \n In any case, it can take days or weeks before a patient tests positive for antibodies to a new infection, so the test may not be useful in diagnosing current illnesses. \n So while an effective antibody test may produce a fairly comprehensive picture of an outbreak, that picture will lag a bit behind the reality.

CT扫描可以让医生识别出感染导致肺炎的人，肺炎可能是致命的，但扫描不会发现症状较轻的人。\n关于这些数字还有另一个令人困惑的原因。本周有报道称，中国不再将那些病毒检测呈阳性但没有症状的确诊病例计算在内。但一些专家表示，他们不确定到底发生了什么变化。\n中国卫生部门表示，通过CT扫描，他们可以将冠状病毒引起的肺炎与其他一些严重的肺部疾病区别开来。但目前尚不清楚他们是否能将其与其他疾病（如季节性流感）引起的肺炎区分开来；准确度可能因医生阅读扫描结果的技巧而异。\n我们最终会得到更准确的数字吗？\n很有可能。\n现在，实验室正在测试病毒本身，病毒可能很难被发现。通常更容易识别的是免疫系统自身的反应。\n当病人感染时，身体会产生对它的抗体——血液中的蛋白质，识别特定的病原体并触发免疫系统对它的攻击。世界各地的实验室都在努力开发一种新型冠状病毒抗体的测试方法，但目前还没有。\n这可能很棘手。\n人类中有几种冠状病毒，包括引起普通感冒的病毒、Sars（严重急性呼吸综合征）和Mers（中东呼吸综合征）。新病毒的抗体可能很难与人们已经拥有的其他冠状病毒的抗体区分开来。\n在任何情况下，病人可能需要几天或几周的时间才能检测出对新感染的抗体阳性，因此该检测可能对诊断当前疾病没有帮助。\n因此，虽然有效的抗体测试可能会产生一个相当全面的爆发画面，但这一画面将落后于现实。纽约时",

It's very harmful,\" Mr Cui said in the interview that aired on Sunday (March 22). \n \"Eventually, we must have an answer to where the virus originally came from. But, this is the job for the scientists to do, not for diplomats.\" \n Mr Cui's comments represent a sharp public rebuke to Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who has publicly questioned whether the virus originated in China and even touted the idea that it may have been introduced by US Army athletes. \n Such public differences are rare among Chinese officials, who are famous for their ability to stick closely to the Communist Party's official line. \n Mr Cui is appointed directly by President Xi Jinping and holds a vice-ministerial rank in China's political hierarchy. \n That makes him two levels senior to Mr Zhao, whose official title is deputy director of the foreign ministry's Information Department. \n Mr Zhao continued to promote the theory on Sunday, retweeting speculation from a Twitter user who goes by the name \"the lizard king\" that Covid-19 has been around in America \"for a while\". \n The user is described as an \"fl transplant to the desert\", a \"mama\" and \"not an expert\". \n The ministry spokesman's statements have been echoed in official state media in recent days and have provoked anger in Washington. \n President Donald Trump has taken to calling the pathogen the \"Chinese virus\" and has blamed the US's outbreak on the Asian country's early failures to control the disease. \n \"As you know China tried to say at one point -- maybe they stopped now -- that it was caused by American soldiers,\" Mr Trump told reporters March 18. \"That can't happen. It's not going to happen, not as long as I'm president. It comes from China.\" \n Meanwhile, China has also found itself in a tit-for-tat with the Trump administration over foreign journalists in Beijing. \n Last week, authorities in the foreign ministry expelled at least 13 American journalists from Beijing and forced at least seven Chinese nationals to stop working for American news outlets there. \n Asked by Axios about Mr Zhao's comments, Mr Cui referred the question back to the spokesman and his authority as ambassador to speak on behalf of the Chinese government. \n \"Maybe you could go and ask him,\" Mr Cui said. \"I'm here representing my head of the state and my government.\" \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - The drug touted by United States President Donald Trump as a possible line of treatment against the coronavirus comes with severe warnings in China and can kill in dosages as small as 2g. \n China, where the deadly pathogen first emerged in December, recommended the decades-old malaria drug chloroquine to treat infected patients in guidelines issued in February after seeing encouraging results in clinical trials. But within days, it cautioned doctors and health officials about the drug's lethal side effects and rolled back its usage. \n This came after local media reported that a Wuhan Institute of Virology study found that the drug can kill an adult dosed at just twice the daily amount recommended for treatment, which is 1g. \n As the drug has not been approved by the US Food And Drug Administration to treat the disease known as Covid-19, the Chinese experience may be useful as the American regulator studies the medication which has been endorsed by Mr Trump as well as Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk. \n The pandemic, which has sickened more than 235,000 globally and killed over 9,800 people, has triggered growing anxiety across the US as states say they lack testing kits and medical equipment. California instituted a statewide lockdown on Thursday (March 19) to slow the outbreak. \n Chloroquine was among the first group of therapies Chinese scientists identified as being effective in curbing the new coronavirus. Clinical trials on about 130 patients demonstrated the drug's ability to reduce the severity of the illness and speed up virus clearance, according to China's Ministry of Sciences and Technology. \n Chloroquine phosphate was officially recommended on Feb 19 in the Covid-19 treatment guidelines published by China's National Health Commission, along with a few other drugs such as AbbVie Inc's Kaletra and flu drug arbidol as antiviral treatments for patients. The commission recommended no more than a 10-day course of chloroquine for adult patients at 500mg - half a gram - twice a day. \n As hundreds of clinical trials are launched to study potential Covid-19 treatments, stocks of drugmakers and biotechnology companies have racked up big gains on the hope that the industry will see a windfall. But the history of previous viral outbreaks like Ebola and Zika show little success in producing viable treatments. Some potential drugs were developed only after the epidemics already waned through containment measures. \n China's recommendation to use chloroquine in treatment was quickly followed by a warning. \n Two days after the treatment guideline update, the health authorities in Hubei province - China's worst-hit region, where the outbreak started and which accounted for the majority of its over 80,000 patients - asked hospitals to closely watch for, and immediately report, any adverse side effects of chloroquine phosphate, according to a report in local media outlet The Paper. \n The drug is known to have short-term side effects such as nausea, diarrhoea and tinnitus, while long-term use can irreversibly impair eyesight. It is forbidden for pregnant women, as it can cause congenital defects in babies. \n The China Health Commission revised the dosage in a Feb 29 notice tightening chloroquine use. The drug cannot be given to pregnant women, those with heart disease, terminal liver and renal disease, retina and hearing loss and patients on antibiotics such as azithromycin and steroid. \n It can now be given only to patients between 18 and 65 years of age for a seven-day treatment course. Patients weighing over 50kg can take 500mg twice a day - the usual dose - while those weighing less will be administered the drug just once a day after two days of use, according to the latest guidelines. \n ",

The patient stayed on the island for about a week before flying on Garuda Indonesia flight GA858 from Bali to Shanghai on Jan 28. \n The patient was found to have been infected with the coronavirus on Feb 5 by Huainan CDC according to the Weibo post. \n \"For passengers on the aforementioned flights, please enact preventative measures immediately,\" wrote the Anhui administration on its Weibo account, which is a local version of Twitter. \n \"Please don't go out for a while and if you get a fever, go to the nearest hospital,\" the statement said. \"Please use masks when you travel to the medical centre and don't use public transportation,\" it went on. \n Garuda Indonesia spokesman Dicky Irchamsyah said he had not yet received a report about the case but \"will check up on it\". Lion Air spokesman Danang Mandala separately said he would also look into the case. \n Meanwhile, the Health Ministry's disease control and environmental health director-general, Mr Anung Sugihantono, said his office had not yet received the information and was still \"confirming it\" but he was quick to say that it was \"a rumour\". \n The ministry advises regular washing of hands, avoiding uncooked meat and wearing face masks when sick to minimise the chances of contracting the disease. \n The Jakarta Post first obtained the information about the Anhui administration's statement from a Chinese citizen who sent a letter on Wednesday. The citizen provided two links: one was the Weibo post and the other was a search page for \"Epidemic situation, public transportation epidemic inquiry\". \n The Post asked two Chinese journalists from two respected media in China to check whether the links are official or not and both confirmed that the links are official. \n The Chinese citizen who first informed the paper about the alert from the Anhui provincial authorities provided an English translation of the Weibo post and The Post also asked an Indonesian journalist friend who understands Chinese to translate it into Indonesian. \n The Post also ran a search with keyword \"GA858\" on the public transportation history site and found a result dated Jan 28 that contained a link to the Weibo post from Anhui. The newspaper also searched the site with the keyword \"JT2618\" but it did not show any result. \n The Post tried to contact the Anhui and Huainan CDC offices on Wednesday to find more information about the patient but calls were not answered. Indonesian Ambassador to China Djauhari Oratmangun told the Post he had yet to receive any information about the matter but he would find out more information. \n ",

Whether a country's developmental strategy is right depends on that country's situation, said the spokesman, citing China's progress over the past 70 years to become the world's second-largest economy, and lifting over 800 million people out of poverty. \n Those achievements were made under the leadership of the CCP and the \"system of socialism with Chinese characteristics\", benefiting not just China but the rest of the world. \"Though Mr Bilahari himself did not deny China's great achievements, he still criticised the political system and the leadership system that created them. Actually it is logically self-contradictory,\" added the spokesman. \n He added that the country has united around the CCP Central Committee headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, its general secretary, since the 18th National Congress in 2012. \"China is striving hard to modernise the system and capacity for governance. All constructive comments and suggestions are welcomed, but arrogance and prejudice through coloured glasses are unacceptable,\" said the spokesman. \n He also said the Covid-19 coronavirus is \"the enemy to all mankind\", and that Mr Xi is \"in full command, and the whole country is united as one\" in battling the epidemic, bringing \"positive results\". \n The spokesman questioned why the same criticism was not levelled when the H1N1 flu originated in North America and spread globally in 2009, saying: \"At the moment, what the world needs most is unity and trust, not the political virus that keeps people at bay.\" \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "On the afternoon of Tuesday, 17 March, the round table television programme discussed Cuba's strategy to control and prevent the expansion of covid-19, inviting the following panellists:\nDr. Francisco dur á n Garc í a, director of national epidemiology, Ministry of health and social welfare of Cuba, director of the centre for health promotion and disease prevention, Ministry of health and social welfare of Cuba, Dr. Jorge Delgado bustello Mar í a Guadalupe Guzman tirado, director of ipk research, diagnosis and reference center\nDr. Francisco dur á n Garc í a, director of national epidemiology, Ministry of public health (minsap), introduced the latest world development of SARS cov-2 coronary aneurysm, which is the cause of the risk of HIV / AIDS and infectious diseases.\nPhoto: screen capture shows that since the first case was found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, progress has been very rapid.\nHe explained that the latest figures showed that the number of countries with at least one case was 144. According to the latest data released on Tuesday, more than 180000 people were infected and more than 7000 died.\nDr. Duran Garcia stressed China's efforts to contain the virus and pointed out that more than 98000 people outside China had been infected with the virus, with a mortality rate of 4%, higher than during the most severe period in China.\nWith regard to the situation on the island, he confirmed the emergence of two new cases of covid-19 in Cuba, with seven patients diagnosed with the disease.\nHe pointed out that almost all infectious diseases have a feature that they are transmitted through contact with foreign infected persons.no\n\"We cannot talk about the presence of infectious diseases in our country, because when we start to find people with HIV, whether they have symptoms or not, they are associated with any infected people from abroad or with them. 'we are preparing for this,' he said.\nThis means that since January, Cuba has developed a plan for the prevention and control of the epidemic, and since then, a series of actions have been carried out under the leadership of the main national authorities in the country, as the disease requires cross sectoral prevention and treatment.\nThe director of the national epidemiology division of the Ministry of health added that the plan had incorporated knowledge of clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic characteristics.\nIn our country, there is no land border and good control. This advantage minimizes the risk of entering our country, because this person may be spreading disease and has not been detected at the time of entry.\nFrom the beginning, we have taken measures to isolate people with the characteristics of the disease in designated centres, enabling us to closely monitor nearly 25000 primary health care workers and anyone from countries at risk of the epidemic.\nTwo new cases of covid-19 have been reported, bringing the total number of infections in Cuba to seven.\nHe reported that today, the laboratory of the Pedro Kouri Institute of Tropical Medicine confirmed the diagnosis of Cuba's seventh case, almost all of whom came from countries of transmission, two of whom had very close ties with people abroad.\nOn the issue of quarantine, he pointed out that \"this measure is formulated in every country, because the situation of quarantine is becoming more complex, not international\".no\nIf the prescribed measures are taken and there is no evidence of the spread of the disease in a group of cases, then isolation is not justified.\nSimilarly, he explained that shutting down workplaces and educational institutions creates stress and stress, a process known to reduce the body's immune capacity and increase risk.\nAware of this, the country has taken measures in recent days to prevent population aggregation.\n4、 Why is Cuba not taking extreme measures?\nCommenting on why Cuba did not take extreme measures such as quarantine, he explained that quarantine was carried out by each country according to its characteristics. The World Health Organization has developed phased implementation measures.\nThe expert reiterated that all cases found in Cuba were not transmitted but were due to infection abroad.\n\"Segregation is determined on the basis of dissemination and there is no reason at present. 'we didn't try to get there,' he said.\nIt noted that it would also be unwise to close schools or workplaces before domestic broadcasting.\nIf there is no obvious spread and school closure, there will be additional pressure and reduced immunity. He stressed that Cuba noted and publicly announced that a highly populated group had ceased its activities. \"\nCuba and acute respiratory infections\nMar í a Guadalupe Guzm á n tirado, director of the research, diagnosis and reference centre, outlined acute respiratory infection (IRA), which experts believe is the cause of 3 to 5 million deaths worldwide. Despite the abuse of antibiotics and other secondary conditionsno\n\"` in other words, we have encountered this disease in history, most of which are viral, sometimes accompanied by inappropriate use of antibiotics, and confusion due to the similarity of symptoms such as pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, etc., he warned.\nHe said that Cuba has not evaded this reality. Anger is the main cause of death due to infection in our country, but it is also the cause of hospitalization, and in many cases it is also the cause of abuse of antibiotics, because most antibiotics are viral, although bacterial infection can also produce viruses. In addition, it has resulted in absenteeism and absenteeism.\nIn anger, he said, the virus dominates and produces a variety of symptoms, including nephritis, common cold and downhill pneumonia, bronchopneumonia and bronchitis in children. Different viruses can produce the same symptoms\nIn this regard, he stressed that the viruses we talked about include influenza A, influenza B, parasitic diseases, enteroviruses d68 and other emerging viruses and coronaviruses that shook the world in 2009.\nMonitoring of respiratory infections in the Cuban system\nThe director of ipk research, diagnosis and Reference Center pointed out that the coronary artery worm is a well-known virus population, which was identified in the 1930s as affecting many animals, such as birds, bats, rabbits, horses, mice and pigs, producing respiratory system and diarrhea, including nervous system.\nIn the 1960s, a group of coronary aneurysms were found, which affected people and became zoos. There are four basic principles, all monitored by Cuba.\nIn this global emergency, more active follow-up is under way, but national health systems monitor viral respiratory and bacterial infections on a daily basis.no\n\"Personal care can only be done by individuals,\" he said.\nDr. Guzman tirado explained that the coronary artery virus is a \"preputial soft virus RNA virus\" Because of these characteristics, people often talk about hand washing or using chlorine or alcohol as part of personal care to deal with these problems because they are easy to solve.\nPersonal care can only be done by everyone. When someone sneezes, if we touch any entrance, such as mouth, eyes or nose, we may be infected with any kind of virus. Therefore, frequent hand washing is required.\n\"However, the occurrence of coronary aneurysm in Wuhan at the end of 2019 is a new disease, which is known to be very similar to the isolated SARS in bats. Bats are a collection of different viruses.\"\nHe recalled that in 2009, mortality was high in the eastern Mediterranean, between 30 and 35 per cent, and that economic and social development in southern Africa had been strengthened. In 2012, the death rate of SARS in China was 9%, which was very serious.\nAs for the new coronary artery aneurysm virus, because it is similar to the SARS virus in bats, ipk experts believe that although there may be an unrecognized intermediate host, it is likely to come from bats.\n\"` when viewed through an electron microscope, its eyeball is similar to the crown, which is called the coronary artery.\nPhoto: screen capture technology is necessary for covid-19 detection.\nOn the other hand, Dr. Mar í a Guadalupe Guzman tirado, director of the ipk research, diagnosis and reference center, explained that acute respiratory infection was one of the causes of death among 3 to 5 million people worldwide, and Cuba was not spared.no These viruses may cause a range of different types of symptoms, so different viruses may produce the same symptoms.\nAccording to experts, this kind of coronary artery was diagnosed by the former nasofarinigeo, which is a cheap technology with a cost of up to $50. We have not only ipk, but also Villa Clara and Santiago in Cuba. \"We also have reagents, professionals, laboratories, equipment and so on,\" he said.\nWith regard to the Convention on the rights of the child, doctors stressed that the Convention has three main functions: Research on infectious diseases, specialized services and teaching. The center provides treatment for people living with HIV / AIDS in accordance with the protocol of the World Health Organization, China's experience and China's experience.\nIn terms of teaching, staff of the Cuban health system and other institutions, i.e. staff from different sectors, as well as trainers who impart knowledge in other centres, have been trained.\nIn addition, communication with scientists from other countries and the international health organization is not only for the treatment of coronary artery aneurysm, but also for the prevention and treatment of other diseases. The expert thanked the solidarity with Cuba.\nDiagnosis of new coronary artery\nThe diagnosis of this coronavirus was carried out through the former nasofarinegeo. In this case, we found the particles of the virus through the advanced molecular technology, the so-called real-time global warming potential, which was used to identify different types of viruses.\nThey are modern and expensive methods. Real time PSR testing could cost between $40 and $50, he said.no\nHe added that the technology was available at ipk in Cuba and at three laboratories at provincial health and epidemiological centres in Havana, Villa Clara and Santiago.\nPrevious photos\n4、 Strengthening community participation\n17. Pablo FeAl Canizares, head of the unit for health promotion and disease prevention, said that in Cuba, the health system has taken action to protect people. He said the plan is in line with the country's and the rest of the world's health experience.\nFamily doctor clinics and polyclinics have been organized to provide closer care, she said. The main task now is to identify vulnerable groups, such as people over 60 years of age or with respiratory diseases, those living alone and elderly homes.\nIn addition to the disinfection campaign, he argued, family doctors have intensified active investigations, prioritized the group and looked for respiratory symptoms in order to take immediate action.\nHe said the plan provided for certification of each process, explaining that more specialized training was now needed after training activities were carried out nationwide.\nAnyone can view this photo\nWith regard to the publicity plan, Pablo FeAl Ca ñ azas added that the level of public participation had increased and that the state media had provided timely and authentic information, highlighting the risks but not causing panic.\n\"The most important thing is to convey the message of trust, security and the need of the Cuban people for self-protection.\".\nAt the same time, media publicity and education materials have been produced, and interdepartmental participation has been increased. Each organization has its own missionno\nThe expert recommends that if respiratory symptoms occur, you should see a doctor as soon as possible and avoid leaving the country, and if you travel and return, you should be examined by the health authorities.\n\"Above all, Cubans have to be cautious, responsible and cautious,\" he said.\nHe reiterated that money laundering was the most effective measure to prevent the disease. As for the nasobuco people, he called on the Cubans to show their solidarity because they could make them in their own homes. \"The purpose of industrial production is to ensure that people in direct contact with infected or suspicious persons (such as doctors) wear masks.\".\n[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:TrackMoves/> <w:TrackFormatting/>

Colaboración Médica Cubana, precisó que la brigada médica cubana en el exterior está presente en 34 países que tienen reportes de la enfermedad.\nTodos los colaboradores cubanos han sido capacitados para enfrentarse a la enfermedad. A través de un grupo de WhatsApp se mantienen informados 24 horas y saben que tienen como premisa la protección. A la familia de estos compañeros queremos decirles que están protegidos, aseguróno\nWith regard to requests from other governments for support from Cuba, doctors explained that a decision on cooperation was being taken.\n(welcome SM Braemar's team is ready)\nWith regard to the movement of passengers on the MS Braemar cruiser, which will stop at the Cuban port on Wednesday morning, Dr. Duran Garcia pointed out that all measures had been taken at the landing site and at the airport to avoid danger to our people. He said.\nThis humanitarian action has been appreciated by many parts of the world and by others on board, who have emphasized the solidarity of the Cuban people.",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "3月17日星期二下午，圆桌会议电视节目讨论了古巴控制和防止COVID-19扩大的战略，邀请以下小组成员：\n•Francisco Durán García博士，古巴卫生和社会福利部国家流行病学主任，古巴卫生和社会福利部健康促进和疾病预防中心主任，Jorge Delgado Bustillo博士María Guadalupe Guzman Tirado，IPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任\n公共卫生部（MINSAP）国家流行病学主任Francisco Durán García博士介绍了SARS COV-2冠状动脉瘤的最新世界发展情况，该冠状动脉瘤是造成艾滋病毒/艾滋病的危险和传染性疾病的原因。\n照片：屏幕捕捉显示，自2019年12月在中国武汉市发现首例病例以来，进展非常迅速。\n他解释说，最新数字表明，至少有一个病例的国家数目为144个，根据本星期二公布的最新数据，有180 000多人感染，7 000多人死亡。\n杜兰·加西亚博士强调了中国为遏制这一病毒所作的努力，并指出，在中国境外，有98 000多人感染了这一病毒，死亡率为4%，高于中国感染最严重的时期。\n关于岛上的情况，他证实古巴出现了两个新的COVID-19病例，使七名患者被诊断患有这种疾病。\n他指出，几乎所有的传染病都有一个特点，即它们是通过与外国感染者接触传染的。否\n“我们不能谈论在我国存在传染病，因为当我们开始发现有艾滋病毒的人时，不管有没有症状，他们与来自国外的任何感染者或与他们有联系。他说，我们正在为这种情况做准备。\n这意味着，自1月份以来，古巴制定了预防和控制这一流行病的计划，自那时以来，在全国主要国家当局的领导下，开展了一系列行动，因为这一疾病需要跨部门的防治。\n卫生部国家流行病学司司长补充说，该计划已将各种临床、流行病和治疗特点的知识纳入其中。\n在我国，没有陆地边界，控制良好，这一优势最大限度地减少了进入我国的危险，因为这个人可能是在传播疾病，而且在入境时没有检测到。\n从一开始，我们就采取措施，在指定的中心隔离具有这种疾病特征的人，使我们能够密切监测近25 000名初级保健人员和来自有这种流行病危险的国家的任何人。\n据报告，有两个新的COVID-19病例，使古巴的感染者总数达到7人。\n他报告说，今天，Pedro Kouri热带医学研究所实验室证实了对古巴第七例病例的诊断，几乎所有的人都来自传播国，其中两人与国外的人有非常密切的联系。\n关于检疫问题，他指出，“这一措施是在每个国家内制定的，因为检疫的情况正在变得更加复杂，而不是国际性的”。否\n如果采取了规定的措施，并且有一组病例没有证据表明该疾病的传播，那么隔离是没有道理的。\n同样，他解释说，关闭工作场所和教育机构造成了压力和压力，这一过程已知会降低人体的免疫能力，并增加风险。\n该国意识到这一点，最近几天已经采取措施防止人口聚集。\n四、为什么古巴没有采取极端措施？\n他在评论古巴为何没有采取检疫等极端措施时解释说，检疫是由每个国家根据其特点采取的。世界卫生组织制定了分阶段实施的措施。\n该专家重申，在古巴发现的所有病例都不是通过传播，而是由于在国外感染。\n“隔离是根据传播情况确定的，目前没有理由。他说，我们努力不到那个时候。\n它指出，在国内广播之前关闭学校或工作场所也是不明智的。\n如果没有明显的传播和关闭学校，就会产生额外的压力，降低免疫能力。他强调说，古巴注意并公开宣布，一个人口高度集中的团体已经停止活动。”\n古巴和急性呼吸道感染\n研究、诊断和参考中心主任María Guadalupe Guzmán Tirado概括地提到急性呼吸道感染（IRA），专家认为，急性呼吸道感染是全世界300万至500万人死亡的原因。尽管滥用抗生素和其他次要情况也起到了作用否\n“`换言之，我们在历史上曾遇到过这种疾病，其中大多数是病毒性的，有时还伴随着不适当地使用抗生素，以及由于诸如肺炎、支气管肺炎等症状的相似性而产生的混淆，他提出警告。\n他说，古巴并没有逃避这一现实，愤怒是我国因感染而死亡的主要原因，但愤怒也是住院的原因，而且在许多情况下也是滥用抗生素的原因，因为大多数抗生素是病毒性的，尽管细菌感染也会产生病毒。此外，这也造成了旷课和缺勤。\n他说，在愤怒中，病毒占据了主要位置，产生了各种各样的症状，包括肾炎、常见感冒和下丘陵性肺炎、支气管肺炎和儿童支气管炎。不同的病毒可以产生相同的症状\n在这方面，他强调，我们谈论的病毒包括2009年震撼世界的流感A、流感B、寄生虫病、肠道病毒D68等新出现的病毒以及冠状病毒。\n监测古巴系统的呼吸道感染情况\nIPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任指出，冠状动脉虫是一个众所周知的病毒群体，在1930年代被确定为影响到许多动物，如鸟类、蝙蝠、兔子、马、老鼠和猪，产生呼吸系统和腹泻，包括神经系统。\n在1960年代，发现了一组冠状动脉瘤，它们影响到人，变成了动物园。有四个基本原则，都由古巴监测。\n在这一全球紧急情况下，目前正在采取更加积极的后续行动，但国家卫生系统每天都在监测病毒性呼吸道感染和细菌感染。否\n他说，“个人护理只能由个人来做”。\nGuzman Tirado医生解释说冠状动脉病毒是“包皮病毒软体病毒RNA病毒”由于这些特点，人们经常谈论洗手或使用氯或酒精作为个人护理的一部分来处理这些问题，因为这些问题很容易得到解决。\n个人护理只能由每个人来做。当有人打喷嚏时，如果我们碰到任何一个入口，例如嘴巴、眼睛或鼻子，我们就可能感染任何一种病毒。因此，需要经常性的洗手。\n“然而，2019年底在武汉出现的冠状动脉瘤是一种新的疾病，已知与蝙蝠体内孤立的非典有很大的相似性，蝙蝠是不同病毒的集合。”\n他回顾说，在2009年，地中海东部地区的死亡率很高，在30%至35%之间，南部非洲经济和社会发展得到加强。而在2012年，中国的非典型性肺炎死亡率为9%，表现得很严重。\n关于新的冠状动脉瘤病毒，由于它与蝙蝠的非典病毒相似，IPK专家认为，虽然可能有一个尚未被承认的中间宿主，但它很可能来自蝙蝠。\n“`当通过电子显微镜观察时，它的眼球与皇冠相似，它被称为冠状动脉。\n照片：屏幕捕捉技术是进行COVID-19检测所必需的。\n另一方面，IPK研究、诊断和参考中心主任María Guadalupe Guzman Tirado博士解释说，急性呼吸道感染是全世界300万至500万人死亡的原因之一，古巴也没有幸免。否这些病毒可能导致一系列不同类型的症状，因此不同的病毒可能产生相同的症状。\n据专家说，这种冠状动脉是通过以前的Nasofarinigeo诊断出来的，这是一种不便宜的技术，其成本高达50美元。我们在古巴不仅有IPK，而且还有Villa Clara和Santiago。他说，“我们还有试剂、专业人员、实验室、设备等”。\n关于《儿童权利公约》，医生强调，该公约有三大职能：传染病研究、专门服务和教学。该中心根据世界卫生组织的议定书、中国的经验和中国的经验，为感染者和艾滋病毒/艾滋病患者提供治疗。\n在教学方面，古巴卫生系统和其他机构的工作人员，即来自不同部门的工作人员，以及在其他中心传授知识的培训人员，已经接受了培训。\n此外，还与其他国家的科学家以及国际卫生组织进行交流，不仅是为了治疗冠状动脉瘤，而且是为了防治其他疾病。该专家感谢对古巴的声援。\n关于新冠状动脉的诊断\n对这种冠状病毒的诊断是通过以前的Nasofarinegeo进行的，在这种情况下，我们通过先进的分子技术，即所谓的实时全球升温潜能值，发现了病毒的粒子，这种技术被用来识别不同类型的病毒。\n它们是现代和昂贵的方法。他说，实时PSR测试可能需要40到50美元。否\n他补充说，这项技术可在古巴的IPK以及设在哈瓦那、Villa Clara和Santiago的省级卫生和流行病中心的三个实验室获得。\n上一组照片\n四、加强社区的参与\n17.促进健康和预防疾病股股长Pablo Feal Canizares说，在古巴，保健系统采取了保护人民的行动。他说，该计划符合该国和世界其他国家的卫生经验。\n她说，家庭医生诊所和综合诊所都已组织起来，以提供更密切的护理。目前的主要任务是查明弱势群体，如60岁以上或患有呼吸道疾病的人、独居者和老人院。\n他争辩说，除了消毒行动外，家庭医生还加强了积极的调查，优先考虑这一群体，并寻找呼吸症状，以便立即采取行动。\n他说，该计划规定对每一个进程进行认证，同时解释说，在全国范围内开展培训活动之后，现在需要进行更加专业化的培训。\n任何人都可以查看此相片\n关于宣传计划，Pablo Feal Cañazas补充说，民众的参与程度有所提高，国家媒体提供了及时、真实的信息，强调了风险，但没有造成恐慌。\n“最重要的是传达信任、安全和古巴人民需要自我保护的信息”。\n与此同时，还制作了媒体宣传教育材料，同时增加了部门间的参与。每个机构都有自己的任务否\n该专家建议，如果出现呼吸症状，应尽快向医生看病，并避免离开该国，如果旅行和返回，则由卫生当局检查。\n他说，“最重要的是，古巴人必须保持谨慎，负责任和谨慎”。\n他重申，洗钱是预防这一疾病的最有效措施。至于Nasobuco人，他呼吁古巴人给予声援，因为他们可以在自己家里制作。“工业生产的目的是确保直接接触感染者或可疑者（如医生）的人员戴面罩。”.\n[如果gte
