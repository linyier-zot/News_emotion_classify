The room has also been sealed.   \n Speaking to the media on Thursday night (Jan 23) hours after a media briefing by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Mr Josef Dolp, the executive vice-president of operations for Southeast Asia and Australasia of Shangri-La Group, also said that the four hotel employees who cleaned the man’s room and served the guests have been isolated. \n The 66-year-old man, who lives in Wuhan, arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Monday night and was travelling with nine other companions. \n He stayed at Rasa Sentosa until Wednesday and during this period, he fell ill and notified the hotel’s staff members.   \n He went by taxi to the Singapore General Hospital on Wednesday and has been isolated after he was admitted.  \n The hotel had put in place precautionary measures even before Jan 20, the day that the man checked into the hotel.  \n Mr Dolp said of what happened after the man left for the hospital: “We isolated our staff and we asked them to stay at home and wear masks and wait for the result.” \n On Thursday evening, the man tested positive for the new coronavirus that has killed 17 in China and infected hundreds in other countries, with cases reported in Japan, South Korea Taiwan, Thailand and the United States. The latest country after Singapore to confirm its first case is Vietnam.  \n CONTRACT TRACING \n With the results confirmed, Mr Dolp said that the Government is aware of the identities of the four isolated hotel employees and their conditions are being monitored by the Government as well.  \n The hotel will support MOH’s efforts in contact tracing beyond the four workers, through the use of surveillance footage and so forth, he added\n.  \n  Mr Josef Dolp, the executive vice-president of operations for Southeast Asia and Australasia of Shangri-La Group, said that hotel employees have been reminded to practise strict hygiene habits at all times. Photo: CNA \n In recent weeks, due to the growing threat of the virus which causes fever, pneumonia and other flu-like symptoms, Mr Dolp said that the hotel has been taking more precautionary measures. After guests have checked out, the rooms have been thoroughly disinfected and sanitised. \n “We have increased our cleaning and sanitising frequency of guest rooms, hotel facilities and all public areas. Temperature checks are in place for our guests and colleagues.  \n “We have also reminded our staff to practise strict hygiene habits at all times, to stay at home if they are not feeling well and to seek medical attention immediately if they believe they have some symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness,” he added.  \n Mr Dolp said that they will work with other hotel guests who might have concerns about transmission.  \n “We will, of course, install information desks… we will address questions the guests have. We will also, if they want to move, help them to move.” \n The authorities in China confirmed a few days ago that the coronavirus could be transmitted from human to human.  \n Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people. In rare cases, they evolve and spread from human to human. \n The new virus, known as 2019-nCoV, is a strain that has not been previously identified in humans. \n It is in the same family as the ones that caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), as well as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak which killed almost 800 people worldwide from 2002 to 2003, including 33 in Singapore. \n The Sars virus was transmitted from civet cats to humans and the one causing Mers was from one-hump camels to humans. \n To date, the source of the new virus has not yet been established.\n",

The most recent data place where 18 dead and about 634 infected.\nThis measure affects all flights, trains and buses, as well as subway service. Yunfei station, for example, have placed a grating in all accesses minus one. There, a security guard who prefers not to reveal his name said something before the ten o'clock closing came into force, the number of people is much lower than that of a normal day. Confesses \"eager to go home\". The ban also affects intercity taxis, although the street is one, and Didi-one phone application similar to über- no drivers available. Highways have been cut, so private cars can not leave the city.\nThis blockage is one of the measures included in the protocol more serious action, whose launch announced Wednesday the State Council, although the scenario is listed as Level B infectious disease, the second highest. Another of the provisions referred to is the mobilization of the armed forces. A nearby town, Huanggang, located 70 kilometers from Wuhan, also will close public bus and train to the end of Thursday, according to the mayor announced. The authorities have also ordered the closure of entertainment venues in the city of 7.5 million inhabitants, such as cinemas and Internet cafes, and have asked people not to leave it except for special circumstances, reports Reuters. Do the same the smallest relatively Ezhou, of a population of one million residents.\nBefore the announcement of the siege in Wuhan, a lot of people I headed for the airport and railway stations in order to leave town before it came into force. One was Niki, a Taiwanese student of 22 who had come to Wuhan to visit a friend. Niki expressed the conviction that make it to time because it had found a particular driver willing to take her. \"I've come to the wrong place!\" Goodbye as he ran down the street pushing his luggage. Wuhan Airport has been saturated with billing queues up to 100 meters, local media reported.\nWith this decision, the Government intends to isolate the population, the epicenter of the outbreak, which is particularly important given the proximity of the Chinese New Year. At this festival, which will take place next Saturday, followed a week of national holidays in which people usually visit relatives in other parts of the country or traveling abroad. Shifts can achieve these days the figure of 3,000 million, which is the largest human migration in the world. Wuhan, home to 11 million people -more than London or New York, is also a knot in Chinese railway communications. And Thursday in an unusual contrast, the windows of many establishments in the city look the typical decorations of these dates despite being mostly empty.\nThey are met, therefore instructions Zhong Nanshan, a scientist who leads the team trying to break the coronavirus. \"From the time when transmission between humans is proven [one end discarded until this week], quarantine should be the first priority,\" he declared at a press conference on Tuesday. Zhong, 84, is the largest Chinese eminence in infectious diseases and rose to fame in 2002 directing the Government's response to SARS. This epidemic also originated in China and killed 700 people worldwide after becoming a global crisis, it is marked in memory of the population. \"Quarantine is the most effective measure because we have not developed a specific drug to deal with the coronavirus\", sentenced the researcher.\nAnother requirements instituted by local authorities in Wuhan passes mandatory to use masks in public space. This object has become the first line of defense against the outbreak and nobody moves without it. In many supermarkets, on the other hand, perfectly supplied, the corresponding masks shelf is empty. \"We have sold all, to those of the warehouse.

The newspaper Beijing News reported that many of them are saturated with patients, some of whom make queues outside despite the cold temperatures. Transfusion rooms are also overcrowded, and many patients are crowded, connected to their droppers, in the hallway. \"My father has a high fever and respiratory problems since last January 2.

We transferred to the Wuhan Xinhua hospital and could not serve there.

I chose to limit my trip to the maximum, so tomorrow I'll fly back home. I am very worried, \"he noted. Before the imposition of the veto, most likely Pin Xian has not achieved its purpose. On the same plane, the stewardess Lian shared that flights have experienced a notable decline in the number of passengers. She herself is from Wuhan, but quoted a popular saying to illustrate your peace of mind, \"Shi fu huo bushi, shi huo buguo duo\", \"a blessing not a curse, and a curse has no escape\".\nJust outside the airport, where no exceptional security measures seen, the driver Wang Zheng complained: \"I spent five hours standing in line, passengers do not come, so we do not move\". His son, 13, is not going to school since last January 10 because classes have been suspended. Asked about the credibility given to official figures affected, he replied: \"That's better not to talk\". The government has threatened to punish anyone who contributes to spreading rumors and local or regional administrations maquillen reality.\nDespite his concern, he was optimistic Pin Xian. Not remember the SARS epidemic because it was \"too small\", but it is sure that this time will not be as severe. \"China is now a powerful country and our leader Xi Jinping has addressed the people to ensure that our best minds are working on it.

Severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.\n** Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people and can evolve into strains not previously identified in humans.\n** Preliminary research has suggested that the Wuhan coronavirus may have made the jump into humans from snakes. But Chinese government medical experts have also suggested badgers and rats as possible sources.\n** Like other coronaviruses, the new China virus is being transmitted from person-to-person via droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n** Like the viruses that cause MERS and SARS, the new China virus is an RNA virus, which means it has RNA rather than DNA as its genetic material. This means the virus blends with its host’s DNA, and also means it can mutate rapidly.\n** Testing for the new China virus involves using a real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which identifies the viral RNA in a sample. These could be from a throat swab, a cough sample, or a blood sample if the patient is very ill\n.\n(This story refiles to correct wording in first paragraph to say virus was identified in Wuhan)\n",

airport, to deal with the arrival of a flight departing from Wuhan, before it was closed by the Chinese authorities.\nThe 202 passengers were brought to a sterile area to be measured body temperature by health professionals equipped with glasses and masks and sanitary clothing.\nNo passenger was stopped, but there were emergency ambulances to transport any infected to hospitals, which were placed to prevent the outbreak of the virus.\nYeah.\nOn flights from Wuhan to the United States, passengers were directed to a number of airports: John Kennedy, New York, Los Angeles, O'Hare, Chicago, Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta-- where sanitary facilities were set up for screening cases of contamination.\nThe British authorities have informed that passengers from China who have landed at Heathrow Airport in London are not being tracked, but are given leaflets containing instructions that they may be ill.\nIn Germany, the Frankfurt airport operator said that the government has not yet provided instruction for sorting, so there are no restrictions and they are expected shortly.\nIn Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Health has announced that it will start tracking passengers from flights direct and indirect from China, and in Bahrain the carrier Gulf Air said that it has taken \"preventive measures\" in the case of the virus.\nIn Africa, airports in countries such as Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya are also tracking passengers from China, one of the main economic partners in several African regions.\nThe main feast of Chinese families, equivalent to Christmas in Western countries, is also the largest internal migration on the planet: according to the Chinese Ministry of Transport there will be a total of three billion domestic journeys over the next forty days, Therefore the Chinese authorities are taking further measures at several airports in the country.\nThe World Health Organisation Emergency Committee is meeting today in Geneva, Switzerland, to decide whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus is declaring an international public health emergency.\nInternational regulations stipulate that an outbreak can be designated as an international emergency in a \"extraordinary event\" that represents a risk beyond borders, requiring a coordinated response between several countries.\nYeah.\nThe new virus causing viral pneumonias was detected in China at the end of 2019 and has already infected several hundred people and caused death to at least 17.\nThere are at least 571 infected persons only on Chinese mainland territory and cases have already been detected in Macao, Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and the United States.\nThe Chinese authorities consider the country to be at the \"most critical\" point with regard to the prevention and control of the virus and have quarantined, preventing entry and exit, three cities where over eighteen million people -Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou live.\nIn an unprecedented effort to stop the spread, Chinese New Year celebrations have also been cancelled in various locations including the capital, Beijing.\nThe first cases of the \"2019 -nCoV\" virus appeared in mid-December in the Chinese city of Wuhan, capital and largest city in the Chinese province of Hubei, when people with a viral pneumonia began to arrive at hospitals.\nSymptoms of these coronaviruses ar e more intense than flu and include fever, pain, general malaise and respiratory distress, including shortness of breath.\nThe World Health Organisation Emergency Committee (WHO) meets again today in Geneva, Switzerland, to decide whether the outbreak of the new coronavirus is declaring an international public health emergency.\n",

Protein consumption in emerging countries has soared as the economy and living standards have risen. Interaction between virus also animal and human diseases. known risks, but unfortunately increasingly common. which it can be curbed, but there is also a risk of it becoming a global pandemic. Previous experience was more like that of the Sars virus in 2002-2003. They have since improved prevention mechanisms and response to health alerts across Asia.

To date, the consequences of these events have not spread beyond a few months. Not a big relief, in any case, because if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic, the effects can be serious in a moment of true decay. The strength of a weak global economy in 2020 goes through the evolution of the Chinese economy and the coronavirus does not help. The first reflections and appreciated.

The fall in demand among other issues by lower industrial activity and land and air traffic in China reduced the price of a barrel Brent 6% only last week.\nValue indices and stock market volatility have not yet reacted to these fears appreciably.

If this and other dangers such as geopolitical tensions with Iran are not reflected more in the markets it is because they are more aware of the central banks. Lax monetary policy seems to have undermined the ability to emit warning signals.\nIf you get to a pandemic, experience dictates that could be affected values ​​emerging companies, with falls of up to 20%. SARS life took 800 people and had an estimated cost of $ 50,000 million. Already more than 40 million Chinese citizens isolated but some analysts fear that this circle of protection has been late. It has rekindled the debate in the medical community about whether the massive use of antibiotics in farm animals is having a negative effect on immunity levels in humans.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "部长会议由古巴共和国总统米格尔·迪亚斯·卡内尔·贝穆德斯领导，并由曼努埃尔·马雷罗·克鲁斯总理领导，于1月最后一个星期三举行会议，讨论国家经济和社会生活的问题。\n在这次会议上，最高政府机构的议程讨论了奥尔金省的土地和城市管理计划、第一次国家全面控制钢铁工业企业集团Gesime的结果以及文化部门的外国投资和出口。科学和体育。\n此外，还介绍了确保遵守全国人民政权代表大会去年12月通过的立法时间表的组织措施，以及古巴预防和控制新冠状动脉的计划。\n一个多月以前评论\n为了充分利用奥尔金省的自然、旅游、生产和人力潜力——该省是该岛第三大省，人口刚超过100万——部长会议批准了该领土的土地和城市规划计划，该计划还包括：北部旅游区，首都城市和另外七个沿海城市。\n正如有形规划研究所所长Samuel Rodiles Planas所详细说明的那样，这些指导文件为投资进程的短期、中期和长期远景规划提供了战略远景，并确定了灵活和有活力的领土发展模式。\n他说，预计Holguin工业和旅游业将得到巩固，该地区的潜力很大。同时，将继续按设计的分阶段实施东西传输系统。\n否\n在这方面，总理说，“该地区有一项明确的旅游发展战略，该战略是全面的，目的是创造就业机会和促进与古巴经济其他部门的生产联系”。\nMarrero Cruz说，为此目的，我们从共产党中央委员会第一书记劳尔·卡斯特罗·鲁斯将军那里得到了50多条指示，我们必须在这一发展中考虑到这一点，在这一发展中，秩序和纪律必须占主导地位。\n国家综合控制A Gesime\n在近20个控制机构和实体的参与下，对钢铁工业企业集团（称为Gesime）进行了第一次全面的国家控制，该集团负责指导钢铁和机械部门的工业政策。\n共和国主计长Gladys Bejerano Portela告诉部长会议成员，这项工作的目的是评估企业集团为确保遵守其经济计划和发展战略、处理和预防犯罪而采取的行动。1.非法入境和腐败表现，同时评估内部管制制度的效力。\n主计长说，80%的缺陷具有主观性，在与安全、运输、工资和工作安全有关的活动中反复出现。然而，公众对科学和技术促进发展协会的活动以及犯罪行为，特别是在生产过程中的犯罪行为提出的申诉、控告和要求都在减少。\n否\n经过广泛讨论，在执行2014年给予安的列斯钢铁公司的信贷时发现了一些问题，该公司目前正在研究中，主计长说，“重要的是，所有管理人员都要考虑我们的工作方法……在检查一份工作时，该机构有义务用手触摸事物（……），在有问题的地方，必须到达、看到和交谈。”\n二、文化、科学和体育，包括对经济的贡献\n外国投资和出口问题每月都被列入部长会议的议程，这与古巴政府优先重视这些对该岛可持续发展至关重要的问题是一致的。\n这次辩论的重点是文化、体育和科学部门能够继续作出的贡献，外贸和外国投资的负责人罗德里戈·马尔米耶卡·迪亚斯强调指出，这些部门“具有实现出口多样化和增加出口的潜力，对国家未来的经济和社会发展计划有直接影响。”\n部长指出，已经开始采取措施，增加外来资本的参与，以此作为发展这些工业和扩大其专业服务能力的途径。文化部列出了处于不同筹备阶段的6家企业，科学、技术和环境部列出了另外5家企业，也有外国参与。\n关于出口，他认为这三个机构都计划开展活动，扩大预期的数量，主要是专业服务。\n否\n立法时间表：需采取的行动\n古巴政府最高机关还在关于组织措施的会议上讨论了确保遵守立法时间表的问题。去年12月由全国人民政权代表大会通过，正如迪亚斯-加内尔总统重申的那样，这是今年的主要工作之一。\n司法部长Oscar Silvera Martínez在详细阐述这一问题时指出，“时间表的制定具有必要的灵活性，以满足立法工作的优先事项和国家的需要”。\n它回顾说，该委员会由39项法律和31项法令组成，议会每年将评估其执行情况并通过必要的修正案。\n部长详细说明了为协调、组织和监督立法时间表的执行而建立的工作制度，这是一个“需要高度集中和优先考虑的复杂进程”，他强调了这一点。\n根据立法时间表，在2月份，必须提交关于干部及其储备工作系统、在古巴农业中使用转基因生物以及改进国家文件管理系统的法令，供国务委员会批准。还有档案\n司法部长说，有五项法律正在审议中，供议会于今年7月审议：外交部；部长会议的组织和运作；省人民政权政府的组织和运作。（a）市镇行政委员会的组织和运作；\n否\n在这一点上，Marrero Cruz坚决提到严格遵守《宪法》，“我们都通过了最高文件，必须成为一个永久性的工作文件，但也必须成为一个永久性的参考文件”。\n正如总理所指出的那样，司法部必须成为一个对《宪法》的遵守情况保持长期警惕的机构。\n古巴对冠状动脉的警报\n世界卫生组织在15个国家中有5 000多个新冠状动脉感染病例，其中99%在中国，因此敦促世界各国政府保持警惕，采取行动，防止已经造成100多人死亡的这种传染。\n在不浪费时间的情况下，部长会议通过了一项预防和控制所谓“武汉肺炎”的计划，这是一个中国城市，据报第一批患急性呼吸系统综合征的病人来自那里，主要是通过病毒携带者向中国人传播的唾液。咳嗽或打喷嚏。\n公共卫生部长若塞安赫尔·波尔图·米兰达在会上明确指出，该计划的目标是“尽量减少冠状动脉在我国境内引进和传播的危险，尽量减少这种流行病对人民健康的负面影响及其对经济和社会领域的影响”。\n他证实，主要的行动包括根据国际卫生管制条例保护我国边界，这些条例在入境点生效，目的是阻止生病的旅客通过机场、港口和海上入境。\n此外，它还补充说，“确保严格遵守对来自传输区的旅客和机组人员抵达后的监测和控制措施”。\n否\n他概述了不仅需要由公共卫生部门，而且需要由国家其他中央行政机构执行的措施。\n在这种情况下，他补充说，设立了一个临时工作组来指导预防和防备新冠状动脉瘤的行动，就象过去对埃博拉和H1N1等疾病所做的那样，古巴在这方面有着丰富的经验，可以作出准确的反应。\n",

The US is 6th on the list, Australia 10th, the UK 17th and India 23rd, the researchers said in the study released on Tuesday.\nAccording to the study by the university's WorldPop team, Bangkok in Thailand is currently the city most at risk from a global spread of the virus. Hong Kong is second on the list, followed by Taipei in Taiwan.\nSydney, New York and London are among the top 20 other major international cities ranked in the research, released on Tuesday.\nWithin mainland China, the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chongqing are all identified as high-risk by the researchers, along with the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Henan.\n\"It's vital that we understand patterns of population movement, both within China and globally, in order to assess how this new virus might spread -- domestically and internationally,\" said Andrew Tatem, a professor at the University of Southampton.\n\"By mapping these trends and identifying high-risk areas, we can help inform public health interventions, such as screenings and healthcare preparedness,\" Tatem said\n.\nThe team used anonymised mobile phone and IP address data -- which helps to identify devices -- along with international air travel data to understand typical patterns of movement of people within China, and worldwide, during the annual 40-day Lunar New Year celebrations.\nFrom this, they identified 18 Chinese cities -- including Wuhan -- at high-risk from the new coronavirus, and established the volume of air passengers likely to be travelling from these cities to global destinations over a three month period.\nThe team, including researchers from the University of Toronto in Canada, and the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, was then able to rank the top 30 most at-risk countries and cities around the world.\nThe researchers acknowledge that their analysis is based on 'non-outbreak' travel patterns, but highlight that a high proportion of people travelled with symptoms at an early stage of the outbreak, before restrictions were put in place.\nTravel cordons are likely to have only coincided with the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan for the holiday period, the researchers noted.\nAccording to Wuhan authorities, it is likely that more than five million people had already left the city, they said.\n\"The spread of the new coronavirus is a fast-moving situation and we are closely monitoring the epidemic in order to provide further up-to-date analysis on the likely spread,\" said Shengjie Lai from the University of Southampton.\n\"This includes the effectiveness of the transport lockdown in Chinese cities and transmission by people returning from the Lunar New Year holiday, which has been extended to February 2,\" said Lai.\n",

ET Sunday, US citizens who have traveled in China within 14 days will be directed to one of eight airports designated for screening, with three more to be added Monday.\nWe can’t have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem - the coronavirus, Trump told Fox during a short interview broadcast on Sunday. He said US officials had offered China tremendous help in dealing with the epidemic.\nTrump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, in a separate interview, said China had been more open about the coronavirus than it has been in previous crises but had not yet accepted US offers of assistance.\nSo far the Chinese have been more transparent certainly than in past crises and we appreciate that, O’Brien said in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation.\nHe said Beijing has still not responded to US offers of help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health professionals.\nWe’ve got tremendous expertise, he said. This is a worldwide concern. We want to help our Chinese colleagues if we can and we’ve made the offer and we’ll see if they accept the offer\n.\nThe Group of Seven leading industrialized democracies are seeking a unified procedure to tackle the fast-spreading coronavirus, and will hold a conference on the virus, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday, after speaking with US Health Secretary Alex Azar. Azar’s office had no immediate comment.\nIn addition to Germany and the United States, the G7 includes France, Italy, Japan, Canada and Britain.\nCDC officials have not been invited into China, but are in neighboring Kazakhstan to help guard against the spread of the virus, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday during a visit there.\nYou’ve got a long border with China which is where this disease has emanated from, Pompeo said in an interview with a Kazakh journalist. And we’ve got our people from the Center for Disease Control right here on the ground, helping Kazakhstan deal with this so that you don’t have an enormous outbreak.\nThe local health commission in China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, reported 56 new deaths on Sunday, bringing the total to 350.\nAt least 171 cases have been reported in more than two dozen other countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, Thailand, Hong Kong and Britain.\nA ninth case of the fast-spreading virus was confirmed in the United States on Sunday, in Santa Clara, in the San Francisco Bay area, health officials said. The Pentagon is providing housing for people arriving from overseas who might need to be quarantined.\nAmericans who visited China’s Hubei Province, epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic, will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of 14 days - the incubation period of the virus - upon entering the United States. Americans who traveled to other parts of mainland China will undergo health screening and be asked to self-quarantine for up to 14 days.\nForeigners who have traveled in China within 14 days of their arrival will be denied entry.\nChad Wolf, U.S\n. Homeland Security acting secretary, said the overall risk to the American public remains low.\nThe coronavirus is believed to have originated in a market that traded illegally in wildlife in Hubei’s provincial capital, Wuhan.\n",

Even North Korea is banning Chinese people from entering,” wrote the anonymous author of the petition, adding that even a temporary ban would help stop the virus from spreading too widely.\nThe Blue House has not directly responded to the petition. When asked about other countries’ bans on Chinese entries, its spokesman said only that the issue should be handled in close consultation with the World Health Organization.\nThe newly identified coronavirus has created alarm because many of its details are still unknown. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases. It is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads.\n“The government must respond to the petition and come up with strong measures such as barring Chinese tourists,” said a passerby in Seoul, a man in his 50s who only gave his surname Chae.

        "news_content_translate_en": "LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s domestic coal mines are struggling to ramp up production in the face of the ongoing coronavirus epidemic. That’s a situation that may seem positive for seaborne exporters, but in reality it may be challenging for miners to take advantage.\nWhile there may be increased demand for imported coal in China in coming weeks, the problem for major exporters such as Indonesia, Australia and the United States is going to be one of logistics.\nThe coronavirus is starting to have an impact on supply chains and will make it more challenging for shippers to find vessels to go to China. And even if exporters do get their goods to Chinese ports, they will likely face headaches in unloading cargoes and transporting them from docks to end-users.\nBy Thursday, the country’s health authority said, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan had reached 563, with more than 28,000 others infected.\nWhile the fatalities and infections draw headlines, the impact of the virus is starting to cascade through China’s economy - as well as businesses in countries that trade heavily with the world’s largest consumer of commodities.\nThe challenge of shipping coal to China was illustrated by the Australian government’s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on vessels leaving mainland China after Feb. 1.\nThis means such vessels will face delays upon reaching Australian ports, as the sailing time between China and both the east and west coasts of Australia is generally less than 14 days.\nVessel queues outside Australian coal ports are already lengthening. Argus Media reported on Feb. 4 that the number of ships waiting outside Newcastle, the world’s largest coal export harbor, was at an 18-month high of 20 vessels\n.\nThere are some other factors that may be contributing to longer vessel waiting times, such as weather and port and rail maintenance, but the overall trend is clear: Shipments to, as well as from, China are becoming more complicated to arrange.\nOne thing that is working in exporters’ favor is a sharp decline in shipping rates. The rate to ship coal from Newcastle to China dropped to $5.87 a tonne on Wednesday, the lowest in almost four years and about a third of the $16.49 peak reached in September last year.\nAt these freight prices, shipping companies will be losing money on every voyage, while they are also facing higher costs from the mandatory switch to cleaner fuels that kicked in last month as part of a change in global shipping regulations known as IMO2020.\nWhile the cost of shipping may be depressed, the main challenge will be securing vessels with owners prepared to send them to China.\nCertainly, Asian seaborne coal prices have yet to show any meaningful spike from China’s domestic coal woes.\nThe price of 6,000 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) coal at Newcastle, as assessed by brokers Tullett Prebon climbed to $69.35 a tonne on Thursday, up from a recent low of $66.30 on Feb. 3, but still below the high so far this year of $72 on Jan. 13.\nThe price of lower-quality 4,200 kcal/kg coal from Indonesia has fared better, with the weekly Argus index rising to a six-month high of $35.48 a tonne in the week ended Jan. 31.\nThe rise in the Indonesian coal price follows similar gains in domestic prices in China, with thermal coal at Qinhuangdao, as assessed by SteelHome ending at 563 yuan ($80.66) on Wednesday, down slightly from 564 yuan on Feb. 4, which was the highest in three months.\nThe coal market appears to be reacting with caution to the coronavirus, with still considerable uncertainty over how much domestic output has been lost, what transport bottlenecks exist currently in China and whether more imported coal will be needed\n. Even if it is, can it get there efficiently?\nWhat is becoming clearer is that the efforts to contain the virus by limiting economic activity in China is going to have multiple flow-on effects through commodity supply chains.\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In January 30th, the WHO launched the new contagion of the new coronavirus as an international public health emergency. At the same time, it expressed confidence in the ability of China to control the epidemic. With more and more cases in China showing the spread of the epidemic, more and more countries are affected, including Russia and other multinational governments taking measures to close the border, the United States, the United Kingdom and France and other airlines have taken grounded flights, and some countries have begun to withdraw overseas Chinese.\nA Agence France-Presse reporter saw a white haired man wearing a mask and a more than 60 year old man who appeared to be on the street in Wuhan on January 30th. He suddenly fell dead and was holding a shopping bag. Wuhan used to be crowded with people. Now there are few pedestrians on the street. No one dares to approach the man who died on the side of the road.\nMedical staff and some onlookers were worried, and the atmosphere in the whole city of Wuhan was scared. The reporter reported that the Sixth Hospital of Wuhan is one of the main medical centers for the treatment of pneumonia patients in Wuhan. It is full of people waiting for examination.\nThe Chinese authorities have taken unprecedented measures to block the city, blocking roads and flights, and trying to stop the spread of the virus.\nFrench historian and Chinese expert Francois gudeming, now an Asia consultant at the University of Montaigne in France, said it was true that the Chinese government delayed acknowledging the outbreak and drew criticism. It is true that the Chinese government has not invested enough in public health, such as the lack of hospitals and freelance doctors. In the second stage, the Chinese government took urgent measures. Although it made life inconvenient for the local people, there was no other way. The Chinese government has taken relatively strict measures to control the spread of the epidemic to other countries.\nFor criticizing the lack of transparency of the Chinese government in dealing with the crisis, Gu Deming believes that it is true that the initial stage of the outbreak was like this. Although the central government was not completely transparent in dealing with the epidemic since January 20, especially in how to find the origin of the virus, there was little information from the outside world. At present, the Chinese government has not cooperated with the outside world, but it has improved compared with the outbreak of SARS in 2003 Time has improved. We can see some English articles published by Chinese criticizing the government's slow action. In addition, we can use wechat to report local officials' concealment of the epidemic, showing some changes.\nThe current situation is that China's new coronavirus can be transmitted to humans rapidly, and the number of cases is faster than that of 2003 SARS virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome.\n。\nBut the initial symptoms of SARS are high fever and dry cough, which lead to dyspnea. In a few days, severe patients need artificial oxygen to survive. The latent period of the new coronavirus is almost asymptomatic.\nWuhan is suffering from severe pneumonia.

        "news_content_translate_en": "The United States is the first infected country where Wuhan pneumonia has spread to the outside world: a Chinese working in Seattle returned to work after visiting his family in Wuhan, and soon had a fever and cough. The health authorities in Seattle released the condition of the Chinese for the first time, treated him effectively, and provided relevant data to China. At present, five patients with Wuhan pneumonia have been found in the United States, all of them Chinese who have been to China. The Institute of allergy and infectious diseases of the National Institutes of health and the Department of medical research of several universities announced the development of a new Wuhan coronavirus vaccine. After three months, the clinical trial will take place in a year. Five major airports in the United States have screened passengers from Wuhan, and the State Council has upgraded the travel warning to Wuhan from level 2 to level 4. The State Council decided to send a transfer flight on January 28 to bring back all American citizens in Wuhan. The mainstream media in the United States put the news of Wuhan pneumonia in an important position to report, and expressed shock and wonder that the Chinese Communist government closed Wuhan, with a population of more than 10 million, and cut off all contact with the outside world. Americans don't believe what the Chinese authorities say. There are only 2000 people infected and more than 80 people died in Wuhan. They know that the epidemic in Wuhan is more than several times and dozens of times more serious than that announced by the Chinese authorities. However, the United States did not close its doors to the Chinese like China's brother North Korea, but some Chinese public opinions refer to Wuhan pneumonia as a biological and chemical weapon used by the United States to prevent the rise of China's great power. In the United States, of course, the most concerned about Wuhan pneumonia is 5 million Chinese in the United States, most of them come from mainland China, and everyone has relatives or friends in China. These days, when they meet each other, they have to exchange their own information, each of which carries terror and death. This spring festival's new year's Eve meal, because of the concern for domestic relatives and friends, has no taste. Chinese in the United States watch CCTV's \"Spring Festival Gala\" every year. Although the \"Spring Festival Gala\" is more and more like \"chicken ribs\", which is tasteless and regrettable to be abandoned, it is always entertainment from the motherland, which is better than nothing. This year, many Chinese in the United States hope CCTV to cancel the \"Spring Festival Gala\", but on the thirties of this year, they see the \"Spring Festival Gala\" on TV, which is indeed regardless of the helpless Wuhan people The fear of life and death and the enveloped land of China, singing, dancing, rising, and joyful, are not ashamed to celebrate Xi Jinping's new socialist era. This year's Spring Festival Gala, in the eyes of many Chinese Americans, is not only \"chicken ribs\", but also dehumanizing\n。 At present, Chinese from all over the United States are voluntarily donating to buy masks for Wuhan citizens and medical staff. Some people have proposed to buy at least 10 million masks. A Chinese in Los Angeles took a donation to a warehouse store to buy all the masks in the store. The manager asked the reason and gave all the masks to the buyer free of charge. The problem now is that Chinese Americans don't know who to give the masks they bought, and there is no official institution in China to accept overseas donations. The United States is looking at Wuhan, not only to help Wuhan find a good medicine against the new coronavirus, but also to continue to provide China with real information about Wuhan pneumonia. Recently, the US online science journal wired published the model inference of authoritative virologists, pointing out that by February 4, Wuhan will have more than 190000 people infected with pneumonia, more in the country, and may become the most serious worldwide infectious disease after the Spanish influenza outbreak in 1918. In order to control the spread of pneumonia in Wuhan, 75% of the infectious sources must be controlled, but it has not been done. Before the closure of the city, there were 150000 people flowing out of Wuhan to the whole country every day, and only Tibet was left in China without any cases of infection. According to the false data provided by the CPC authorities, who concluded that Wuhan pneumonia did not constitute a public health emergency of international concern. One day, who will prove that they helped the Chinese government hide the truth about Wuhan pneumonia from the world. The Communist Party of China conceals the real situation of Wuhan pneumonia, while the United States continues to send real information about Wuhan pneumonia to the world. People can see the comments of Chinese netizens on the Internet: Fortunately, the world is not only China, but also the United States.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "In just a few days, Wuhan new coronavirus continues to show the characteristics of \"God infection\", which can be described as \"God does not know the ghost\" to let people \"win\". Ma Xiaowei, director of China's National Health Commission, said on Sunday that the virus was also contagious in its incubation period, according to observations. Some patients may have transmitted their own virus to others before the onset of the disease. Some \"Wuhan pneumonia\" patients have normal body temperature in the early stage, many mild cases and recessive infection. These \"walking infectious sources\" make the prevention and control more difficult. Some influenza patients have no symptoms during the incubation period, but they have been able to infect. At this point, Wuhan new coronavirus is similar to influenza virus.\nIt is reported that there was a confirmed case in Anyang, Henan Province. Five of them were relatives, but none of them had traveled or lived in Wuhan. Three of them had contact with a female family member who came back from Wuhan. They were her father and two aunts, respectively. However, the woman has not had any symptoms of new pneumonia so far. The case shows that during the incubation period before the infected person has any symptoms, it is possible to transmit the virus to others.\nIn addition, the infection of new coronavirus caused by international communication is also proving the great infectious force of this virus. The first 4 confirmed infections in Japan were tourists from Wuhan, but one of the 2 new coronavirus infections found in Japan was a bus driver living in Nara County, who was more than 60 years old. He had no experience of visiting China. But in January, he traveled 2 times from Wuhan.\nThe German Ministry of health in Bavaria held a press conference at 28 a.m. on 10 January 27th to elaborate on the first case of a new coronavirus confirmed in Germany on Monday night. The German patient, a 33 year old man, was infected at a company training meeting last week when she had contact with a Chinese female colleague. It was later found that the Chinese female colleague, although from Shanghai, had just met her parents in Wuhan before coming to Germany. If a few days of training contact can lead to infection, the man recently had close contact with at least 40 people, including children in kindergarten. These people are advised to stay at home for continuous observation and examination\n。\nLi Xingwang, chief expert of the infectious diseases diagnosis and research center of Ditan hospital in Beijing, said at a press conference held on the morning of the 28th of the national health and Health Commission of China that at present some asymptomatic but nucleic acid positive infected people have been observed, and some patients have no obvious fever, occasional dry cough or weakness. According to the law of infectious diseases, these patients also have a certain transmission power Therefore, it brings certain difficulties and complexity to the prevention and control work.\nAs asymptomatic infections are mainly found in \"close contacts\", once they are found, they should be isolated at home and observed in medicine according to the requirements. They can not move freely in public places to ensure the control of infectious sources.\nThe spread of the new coronavirus in Wuhan shows that it not only has the ability of continuous human to human transmission, but also can sometimes come and go without trace. Researchers at Imperial College London released a report on Saturday estimating that as of January 18, an average of 2.6 people had been infected with each case of Wuhan pneumonia. This means that the authorities must block more than 60% of the transmission in order to effectively control the epidemic.\nBased on the total number of international tourists and overseas case reports from Wuhan, the researchers also estimated that there were 4000 new coronavirus cases in Wuhan as of August 18. Compared with the official figure of 4515 newly confirmed cases in China on the 28th, this is not high.\nOnly when the infection rate drops below 1, the number of new cases will gradually decrease and eventually the epidemic will be calmed down, the report said. Given that the estimated infection rate of these viruses is still as high as 2.6, it is unclear whether the \"Wuhan pneumonia\" epidemic can be controlled in China, which will depend on the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures taken in Wuhan and other regions of China.\nIn addition to 8 cases in Taiwan, 69 of the total international diagnoses of the new coronavirus have been identified in 16 countries. The newly added countries are Kampuchea, Sri Lanka and Germany. There were 14 cases in Thailand, 8 in Hong Kong, 7 in Macao, 5 in the United States, 5 in Australia, 5 in Singapore, 4 in Malaysia, 6 in Japan, 4 in Korea, 3 in France, 2 in Vietnam, 2 in Canada, 1 in Nepal, 1 in Cambodia, 1 in Sri Lanka and 1 in Germany.\nThe more optimistic analysis shows that Wuhan new coronavirus is much faster than SARS virus in terms of its transmission speed and adaptability to human body, but this may mean that it may also disappear quickly\n。\nHowever, pessimistic international studies suggest that \"Wuhan pneumonia\" cases may still increase exponentially in the near future. Researchers at Lancaster University in the UK estimate that if the epidemic continues in Wuhan, by February 4, there will be about 190000 cases in Wuhan alone, and such a pattern of infection will be established in other cities in China, and the virus's export abroad will become more frequent.\nReports from Wuhan hospital show that: the hospital is still overcrowded, there are diseases can not be diagnosed, after diagnosis can not be isolated and hospitalized treatment, all kinds of complaints are found in the network and media. Although the number of patients per day has increased dramatically and climbed up, many people still question that the number of outbreaks in China is far lower than the actual number.\n",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "在短短几天中，武汉新冠病毒不断显现“神传染”的特性，可谓“神不知鬼不觉”地让人“中招”。中国国家卫健委主任马晓伟上周日指出，从观察情况来看，这类病毒在潜伏期也具有传染性。一些患者在发病之前可能就已经把自身携带的病毒传染给了他人。部分“武汉肺炎”患者早期体温正常，轻症病例较多，存在隐性感染者，这些“行走的传染源”让防控难度陡增。一些流感患者在病毒潜伏期没有出现症状，却已经具备了传染能力。在这一点上，武汉新冠病毒与流感病毒类似。\n据报道：在河南安阳出现一例确诊病例，其中5人是亲属关系，但均无到武汉旅行和居住过，其中3人曾与从武汉回来的一位女性家人接触，他们分别是该女子的父亲和2个姑姑，但该女子至今却没有出现任何新型肺炎的症状。该病例说明：在被感染者尚未出现任何症状之前的潜伏期内，却有可能把自身病毒传染给他人。\n此外，国际间交流引发的新型冠状病毒传染病例也在证明这一病毒的巨大传染力。日本最早确认的4人感染，均是来自武汉的游客，但日本国内新发现的2例新型冠状病毒感染者之一是居住在奈良县的大巴司机，60多岁，并没有访问中国的经历，但在1月份2次搭载了从武汉市来的旅行团。\n德国巴伐利亚州卫生部28日上午10点举行新闻发布会，详细说明周一（1月27日）晚间确认的德国首例新型冠状病毒病例。该德国病患为33岁男子，在上周的一次公司培训会议上，与一名中国女同事有接触而被感染。后被查出：这名中国女同事虽然来自上海，但在来德国前刚与住在武汉的父母见过面。如果说几天的培训接触会发生感染，这位男子最近至少与40多人有过密切接触，包括上幼儿园的孩子。这些人都被建议留在家里持续观察并进行检查。\n中国国家卫生健康委员会28日上午召开记者会，北京地坛医院感染性疾病诊疗与研究中心首席专家李兴旺表示，目前观察到一些没有症状、但核酸检测为阳性的感染者，还有一些病人发烧不明显，偶尔乾咳或无力；从传染病规律来说，这些病人也具有一定的传播力，因此对防控工作带来一定的困难和複杂性。\n由于无症状感染者主要是在“密切接触者”中发现的，所以一旦被发现，都应按要求进行居家隔离和医学观察，不能随意到公共场所自由活动，保证对传染源的控制。\n新冠病毒在武汉的疫情传播程度表明，它不仅具备了持续人传人的能力，而且有时会来去无踪。关于其传染能力，英国帝国理工学院(Imperial College London)的研究人员上周六发布报告估计，截至1月18日，每个“武汉肺炎”病例平均传染了2.6个人。这意味着，当局要阻断六成以上的传染才能有效地控制疫情。\n基于从武汉出发的国际旅客总量和境外病例报告，这些研究人员还估算，截至18日，武汉共有4000例新冠病毒病例。这与28日中国新确诊病例4515例的官方数字相比，只低不高。\n报告说，只有传染率降至1以下时，新病例的数量才会逐渐减少，最终得以平息疫情。鉴于这类病毒传染率的估算值日前仍然高达2.6，研究人员目前尚不清楚“武汉肺炎”疫情能否在中国得到控制，这将取决于武汉和中国其他地区采取的防控措施的有效性。\n除了台湾8例以外，新型冠状病毒的国际病患累计已经有69例确诊，分布于16个国家，新增国家为柬埔寨、斯里兰卡及德国。分别为泰国14例、香港8例、澳门7例、美国5例、澳洲5例、新加坡5例、马来西亚4例、日本6例、韩国4例、法国3例、越南2例、加拿大2例、尼泊尔1例、柬埔寨1例、斯里兰卡1例及德国1例。\n较乐观的分析认为：从武汉新冠病毒的传播速度以及对人体的适应能力来看，它要比非典病毒快很多，但这可能意味着它可能消失得也快。\n不过，悲观的国际研究认为：“武汉肺炎”病例仍然可能会在近期呈指数增长。英国兰卡斯特大学(Lancaster University)的研究人员估算，如果疫情在武汉持续不减的话，到2月4日，仅在武汉当地就会出现19万左右的病例，并且这样的传染规律也会在中国其他城市建立起来，而病毒的境外输出也会变得更加频繁。\n来自武汉医院的报道显示：医院仍然人满为患，有病得不到诊断，诊断后得不到隔离和住院治疗，种种怨言载道见于网络和媒体。虽然每天的病人数字大幅增加和向上爬坡已惊心动魄，但多方仍质疑中国的疫情数字远远低于实际数字。\n\n",

At the end of February 7, 2020 at 2:58 in the morning, we deeply mourn and mourn.\nPictures of mourning for Dr. Li Wenliang on the Internet, accompanied by candles falling like rain, sent Dr. Li Wenliang off. Some netizens also said in comments by Chinese state media that doctors were arrested at the end of December because of rumors that they could not forget or forgive. The title of a netizen's request for a public apology from Wuhan authorities was blocked, which had been widely spread before.

and don't know - about the drugs deployed against the SARS-like virus.\nWhy anti-retrovirals?\nPatients diagnosed with the common flu are often prescribed an antiviral drug widely known as Tamiflu.\nBut the seasonal flu is \"very different from the Chinese coronavirus\", said Sylvie van der Werf at the Paris-based Pasteur Institute.\nTwo weeks ago Chinese doctors confirmed they had been giving anti-HIV drugs to coronavirus patients in Beijing, based on a 2004 study during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, that showed \"favourable\" responses.\nUsed together, lopinavir and ritonavir decrease the amount of HIV cells in a patient's blood, stripping back the virus's ability to reproduce and attack the immune system.\nDoctors have also combined the treatment with another anti-flu drug called oseltamivir, hoping the creative cocktail can sap the new coronavirus of its strength.\nThe Pentagon is preparing to house up to 1,000 people at military sites who may need to be quarantined due to the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak | @BISouthAfrica https://t.co/sUDS1ISKnT pic.twitter.com/ab2YoV9bWF\nIn Thailand, where there are 19 confirmed cases, a 71-year-old Chinese patient returned a negative test within 48 hours of being given the three drugs.\nBut Thai doctors cautioned the medicine needed to be given under supervision due to possible side effects or it clashing with pre-existing medications.\nDoes it actually work?\nIn short, we don't know for sure\n.\nThe 2004 study showed anti-retrovirals used on patients with SARS had \"substantial clinical benefits\", experts in China said.\nBut random trials on 41 coronavirus patients had \"limitations\", according to the research, which was published in medical journal The Lancet on January 24.\nREAD | 10 myths about the coronavirus\nThe researchers were not able to obtain complete samples from the patients' lower respiratory tract - which is suspected to be the target site of the new coronavirus - and there were not enough patients to verify results.\n\"Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture,\" they wrote.\nWhat's big pharma doing?\nBiotech firms are working on a suite of treatment options.\nCalifornia-based Gilead Sciences said they are working with Chinese authorities on clinical trials to determine if remdesivir -

Molecular biologists from China and Canada analyzed the evolutionary nature of the 2019 ncov virus, which caused pneumonia in China and other countries, and concluded that this was not a single cause, These are two pathogens. The scientists' conclusions are contained in an article published by the biorxiv Electronic Science Library.\nOur analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by at least two different strains. Most likely, it began a few months ago, its presence was known, and began to formally inform the health authorities - researchers wrote.\nScientists from the University of Ottawa (Canada) and Shanghai Fudan University (China) studied two dozen small mutations in the complete 2019 ncov genome set, and came to this conclusion. Blood was extracted from patients in hospitals in Wuhan and other cities in China.\nGeneticists compared these data with RNA fragments of other coronaviruses, including SARS and mers fever in the Middle East. This allows researchers to restore the evolution tree of virus 2019 ncov and understand when common ancestors of all pathogens that exist today emerged.\nThe scientists made two unexpected discoveries\nAbout First, the virus did not appear in early or mid December, but about three or even six months ago. Secondly, biologists found a set of unique mutations in 2019 ncov samples collected in Wuhan. This clearly shows that the outbreak of this viral pneumonia has at least two puerperas.\nAt present, the researchers point out that it is not clear whether the isolation occurred before the virus began to infect the human body or after the outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan. The fact that the pathogen has two different claims, they say, raises questions in itself about the theory that the city's exotic food market is the only source of the virus.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "By Ali Imran Mohd NoordinKUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) -- The first seven days of February saw various developments in Malaysia's efforts to check the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak.This afternoon, Health Minister Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad announced that 15 people in Malaysia have so far been tested positive for the new coronavirus. Eleven of the cases involved Chinese citizens (10 are from Wuhan and one from Guangzhou) while the remaining four cases involved Malaysians.In Malaysia, from Jan 10 up to today (Feb 7), the total cumulative cases of patients under investigation (PUI) stood at 313. Seven of these cases tested positive for 2019-nCoV, 297 tested negative and nine are awaiting laboratory test results.Over the week, there were three important developments with regard to 2019-nCoV. The first was the humanitarian mission to Wuhan where a special flight brought home a number of Malaysians and their families who had been stranded there since Jan 23 after the city was put on lockdown by the Chinese government. In the second development, the first case of 2019-nCoV infection involving a Malaysian was revealed. The number of Malaysians tested positive for the coronavirus has since increased to four.In the third development, two Malaysians were charged in court for making false statements with regard to 2019-nCoV on their Facebook accounts. HUMANITARIAN MISSIONThe Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) mission was carried out successfully. AirAsia Flight AK8264 took off from KLIA2 at 3.20 pm on Feb 3 for Wuhan. Its cargo included half a million pairs of rubber gloves, constituting Malaysia's contribution to China in its efforts to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.On Feb 4 at 5.57 am, the aircraft touched down at KLIA, carrying on board 88 Malaysians and 19 of their non-Malaysian family members who were stuck in Wuhan; 12 flight crew members; eight HADR officials; and six officers from the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing. Another 34 people stranded in Wuhan who were supposed to return to Malaysia could not catch the flight due to logistics issues.After the plane landed in KLIA, all 133 passengers and crew were ferried to the Air Disaster Unit in a bus for health screening. Out of the 107 people 'rescued' from Wuhan, two did not pass the screening and were sent to Hospital Kuala Lumpur.The remaining 105 passengers were taken in a bus to the Higher Education Leadership Academy (AKEPT) in Bandar Enstek, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, for the 14-day quarantine process.The two passengers who failed the health screening were eventually tested negative for 2019-nCoV and they were taken to AKEPT to be quarantined.On Feb 5, Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah said Malaysia will bring home all government staff and their family members in China as soon as possible. CASES INVOLVING MALAYSIANSOn Feb 4, the Health Minister announced the first Malaysian who was tested positive for the coronavirus, a 41-year-old man from Selangor who had travelled to Singapore for a meeting from Jan 16-23.  He was tested positive on Feb 3.The man's sister was tested positive for coronovirus on Feb 6 after coming into contact with him in Sungai Petani, Kedah. She is now in the isolation ward at Hospital Sultanah Bahiyah, Alor Setar.The Health Ministry, in the meantime, has also implemented the process of tracing the close contacts of the 2019-nCoV cases.On Feb 5, a father and child who were among those flown back from Wuhan in the HADR mission were tested positive for the coronavirus. The 45-year-old father and his nine-year-old son did not show any sign of infection when they were first taken to AKEPT. The two are now in the isolation ward at Hospital Tuanku Ja’afar, Seremban. FAKE NEWSOn Feb 5, Attorney General Tan Sri Tommy Thomas said those who initiate and disseminate false information relating to 2019-nCoV on the Internet would be investigated and charged in court if there is a case against them.Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk Mazlan Mansor said as of now 13 investigation papers have been opened in relation to the dissemination of fake news in respect of 2019-nCoV on social media. He said one case was filed in the Kuala Lumpur court on Feb 5 and one more case in Kuala Terengganu on Feb 6. A third case will be filed in Sandakan later. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador advised Malaysians not to waste time disseminating fake news with regard to the coronavirus as it would cause unnecessary panic among the public.\"Yesterday, there was a fake post about a ship that supposedly docked in Kuala Linggi (Melaka) and, according to the person who posted it, the ship came from Wuhan.

We believe sharing information will lead to effectiveness to control outbreak and improve treatment,” he said at a daily briefing here today.Earlier this week, two doctors from Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok said they discovered a new approach – a combination of medications for flu and HIV led to improvement 48 hours after treatment. They said the treatment improved the condition of several patients under their care.As of today, Thailand has confirmed 25 coronavirus cases where nine had been cured and discharged from hospitals.On calls to ban Chinese tourists to the kingdom, Anutin said infection prevention and control measures are more effective than a travel ban which it does not reduce the number of cases. “However, I must reiterate that the people’s lives and health are our top priorities,” he said.Anutin said the Chinese government has expressed its gratitude to the Thai government for taking good care and treated its citizens diagnosed with coronavirus in the kingdom.-- BERNAMA   \r\n ",

But is the outbreak also officially an international\nEmergency? In order to decide this, a body of the World Health Organisation had to\nWHO today ask the following questions:\nLike most experts, the WHO body was of the opinion that:\nthat all these questions must be answered with yes and called the emergency\nOff. The amazing thing is that the decision to the panel everything else\nas lightweight. It was only in the second beginning and after long discussions that the Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, decided to do so. Why the hesitation? Why did the decision become such a policy, and what does this emergency actually mean?\nFirst of all, to clear up a misunderstanding:\nThe WHO decision is not a risk assessment. That the WHO now\nCauses a health emergency, not because it causes the new corona virus\nConsiders it more dangerous than at 22nd. January, when the first emergency meeting took place.\nThe new Coronavirus has been a source of concern to scientists and researchers from the outset. Since the 13th. January gives\ncases outside China. It is now known that the virus has been\nHuman to human transmission, probably since mid-December (New\nEngland Journal of Medicine: Li et al., 2020).\nThe virus has not suddenly become more threatening simply because the WHO\nEmergency call.\nThe call for a health emergency serves something else:\nVery simply, it will give the WHO more powers. She advises\nnot as usual the countries concerned, but begins to\nMeasures to coordinate\nYeah. \"Competences to the WHO and\nMaike Voss, who works at the Foundation Science and Politics on Global Health Issues, explains.\n2005 196 States have agreed on International Health Regulations (IHR). Since then, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for five international health emergencies (PHEIC):\nFor example, when an emergency has been declared, countries must justify what they are doing in terms of health.\ntuna. China could now within\n48-hours must explain why it is useful for the health of the population,\nTo quarantine entire cities. The same applies when countries border\nclose or stop trading. This is also the idea behind the international health emergency to ensure that food\nor medicines continue to come to affected places.\nAt the end of 2019, the Chinese authorities reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) a frequency of pneumonia of unclear cause in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Already a week later, Chinese researchers identified a novel virus as the cause of the disease. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. A few days later, a group around the virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite published the first diagnostic test for the new virus, which researchers provisionally call 2019-nCoV. The test can be used to detect the virus in the laboratory. As a source of the pathogen, the Chinese authorities suspect a food market in Wuhan, where, in addition to fish and seafood, exotic animals such as snakes were sold. The market was closed and disinfected.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals\nYeah. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003, about 8.000 people died, more than 750. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of the year 2019 about 2.500, and every third person has died from it. Overall, however, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause, for example, colds.\nIn China, several thousand people are now ill, some of them, most likely pre-infected, have died of pneumonia caused by the virus. The first infections outside China were known in Thailand, Japan and South Korea. These are travellers who had previously been to Wuhan. I have 21. In January, US authorities reported the first infection in a tourist who returned from Wuhan on the 24th. In January, the first cases in France became known. In the meantime, the first cases in Germany have also been confirmed. Typical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. The virus can cause pneumonia that can end in death. Because it's a viral disease, antibiotics don't help.\nIt is now clear that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. The Chinese authorities have confirmed several such transmissions after about a dozen medical personnel have been notified. Doctors assume that the virus is mainly transmitted via droplet infection. The World Health Organization, like it does on 24th. January, currently reporting that an infected person in sections 1,4 to 2,5 infects other people. If these numbers persist, the virus is less contagious than Sars and also the virus flu. The WHO recommends to observe general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals\nYeah.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The World Health Organization shared on 28. In January, approximately one fifth of the reported cases are seriously affected by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. According to reports, the first victims were patients who had some severe pre-existing diseases. Other infectious diseases also pose a particular risk to people with pre-existing diseases, such as influenza. Coronaviruses are known to mutate, so they can change their heritage. This may lead to them becoming more dangerous to humans during an outbreak, but also to the exact opposite. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) does not currently expect a mortality rate similar to that of the Sars outbreak.\nAlthough the declaration of a health emergency is not a miracle weapon, medical lawyers write in an article published today (Jama: Phelan et al., 2020). It was a \"strong signal to the international community\". The WHO Director-General and many experts hope that countries with weaker health systems will also benefit if the corona virus arrives.\nIn addition, the emergency room is also an operation\nto the sovereignty of a state and thus always a policy. In the case of\nCoronavirus 2019-nCoV in China is even highly political. China has tried to make the world\nmassive containment measures to show that it is in control of the emergency\nMaike Voss said: \"Health protection is always a sign\nChina wanted to show the world that there was no\nNeed help. At a time when it is in a trade conflict with the United States and\nthe new Silk Road Initiative its economic power worldwide\nshows it does not want to show weakness\nYeah.\nThere is something else: in the past\nhealth emergencies often caused in situations where the\nThere is a need for money and help in areas and countries, such as democratic\nRepublic of Congo in the fight against Ebola. Or because more research is urgently needed into an organism\nfor example with Zika virus 2016. But both are true\nthe Coronavirus outbreak rather not to: China demonstrates that\nown forces in the fight against the outbreak gets very far. And researchers\nin recent weeks, huge amounts of data about the virus\nand shared with the WHO.\nThe Director-General of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, should:\nAgainst the background of all this, he must have been torn apart: legally, he must have caused a health emergency. On the other hand, the\nEmergency, some say, the important cooperation with the Chinese government\nto put at risk the data and laboratory samples with the\nWHO and other countries. A collaboration between Ghebreyesus and his\nVisit to China and in talks with the Head of State Xi Jinping in the\nthe past few days.\nAnd so it also fits that Ghebreyesus after the last emergency health meeting\nsaid it bothers him that when asked about the emergency\nYes or no and nothing in between. And that he said twice in today's press conference that the declaration was'no vote of no confidence in China'. It was the politician Ghebreyesus,\nwho emphasized this, in a situation where it was clear that health can also\nbe a very political issue.\nYou can find the full report on the Coronavirus on our topic page.\n",

In Japan, therefore, 33 cases have been confirmed.\nThe remaining 3.700 passengers and crew members should remain on board for another 14 days, said Health Minister Katsunobu Kato. He referred to the previous findings that it may take up to 14 days for the Coronavirus infected to show the first symptoms. The ship had returned to Yokohama, near Tokyo, after landing in ports in Vietnam, Taiwan and other cities in Japan.\nIt was quarantined in the port of Yokohama on Monday. The reason for the quarantine was an 80-year-old boy from Hong Kong who tested positive for the corona virus on Saturday. The man was at 20. In January in Tokyo's neighboring city Yokohama rose and left the Diamond Princess in Hong Kong five days later, it was said. The ten people now diagnosed had all either had symptoms or had close contact with the man.\nMeanwhile, the number of confirmed infections and deaths from the Coronavirus has continued to rise in China. Until Wednesday, further 3.887 infections have been registered, as reported by the Beijing Health Commission, currently 24.324. The number of deaths increased by 65 to 490. The Health Commission also counts more than 23.000 suspicious cases.\nOutside mainland China, there are more than 230 confirmed infections in more than two dozen countries, twelve of them in Germany.\nYeah. Two people died in Hong Kong and the Philippines. According to the doctors, the twelve patients are doing well in Germany. In addition to two infected people who had been flown out of Wuhan on Saturday with other Germans, there are ten patients in Bavaria who are related to the Webasto car supplier. Two of them have a mild fever. The German infected on the Canary Island of La Gomera is also well, according to the authorities.\nThe radical measures to contain the epidemic have led to a drastic slowdown in public life in China. Many factories and offices are still closed for the time being. Supply chains are often interrupted as well. Like Lufthansa, many airlines have cancelled their Chinese flights. The impact on economic life is enormous.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "For most people in the Upper Bavarian small town of Gauting, the Chinese million metropolis of Wuhan is miles away. But this changes rapidly when an employee of a local car supplier discovers the new Coronavirus.\nIt's the first case in Germany. Just a few hours later, webasto's headquarters in the 4000-inhabitant district of Stockdorf Camerateams are swarming, and local pharmacies have a run on oral protection masks and disinfectants on Tuesday. Three other cases relating to the first are already known on Tuesday evening.\nThese, too, are Webasto employees and, like about 1000-others, worked in the Starnberg district headquarters, where the first person was employed, a spokesman for the Bavarian Ministry of Health in Munich and the company reported on Tuesday evening. \"It has been decided that the three new patients at the Munich clinic Schwabing will also be admitted stationary and will be medically monitored and isolated there,\" the ministry continues. \"Some other contact persons are currently being tested for an infection with the Coronavirus.\" Further information should follow on Wednesday. Webasto temporarily closes the Stockdorf site until Sunday.\nThe first confirmed cases in Germany leave those responsible reeling. \"Our night was relatively short,\" says the President of the Bavarian National Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL), Andreas Zapf, on Tuesday. At 20.30 o'clock on Monday evening he is informed that the Bayer has tested positive for the corona virus. The wires have been burning ever since. Shortly before midnight the Bavarian Ministry of Health informs the public, a few hours later the Ministry's lobby bursts from all corners\nYeah.\nAt the press conference, experts are mapping the path that the virus, with its provisional name 2019-nCoV, has taken on its way to Germany: On the 16th. In January, a Chinese employee of Webasto receives a visit from her parents from the region of Wuhan particularly affected by the new Coronavirus in Shanghai. Three days later, she makes her way to the headquarters of her company in Germany. I have 21. In January, she participates in a training course in the Gautinger district of Stockdorf. According to her, she was still doing well.\nOnly on her return to China on the 23rd. In January, the woman feels flu, goes home to a doctor and is tested positive for the corona virus. Monday, the 27th. In January, the company management in Germany learns about the finding. It acts quickly and informs colleagues. An employee who has participated in the training together with the woman and worked in a small group can be tested. At the weekend, Zapf said he felt \"flu-like, more like a severe bronchitis\".\nAnd in fact, the test is positive. The family father comes immediately to the Schwabing Clinic, is closely supervised by the doctors in an isolation room with a lock and und er pressure, and is now fit again. A \"healer\" at the isolation station- this unusual situation makes the treating chief physician Clemens Wendtner joke: \"He is awake, approachable and I would also venture the statement that he is out of danger of life.\" The patient has neither fever nor cough, he is \"doing very well\".\nHowever, the man must remain in isolation for an indefinite period of time. \"We cannot yet say with certainty how long the virus of the sick person, if he is healthy, will continue to be transmitted,\" explains Zapf. The virus is so new that the doctors don't know so many things.\nYeah. Relatively rare is such a transmission: so far only three other cases have been known worldwide in which one person has contracted an infection outside China with another, which occurred in Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan. Most people also had symptoms when they infected others.\nMore suspicious cases are reported in Germany during the day. While the laboratories in the other federal states are still examining the samples, the authorities in the free state are concentrating on around 40 people with whom the German patient and the Chinese woman had closer contact. Among them are not only colleagues, but also the husband's family; they are to stay at home during the incubation period from up to 14 days. In the view, those responsible also have a nursery in Landsberg am Lech district, which visits the patient's little child. \"We do not see any reason to close the crypt at the moment,\" a spokesman for the Land Council emphasises. \"Neither the patient's wife nor child have been affected so far.\"\nIn the case of the company concerned, the employees go in and out on Tuesday- the decision on the temporary closure takes place only in the evening after the three other cases become known. Outside, the Webasto car supplier operates normally before, even if one or other of them reaches the entrance for their own hand disinfection. Most employees don't want to comment on the case. \"No comment,\" it is said again and again. One employee says that there is \"normal operation\". However, there is also uncertainty. Another reported that it was very quiet, apparently many had actually stayed at home.\nThe pharmacies in Gauting and throughout the Worm Valley are experiencing a storm. Demands are made for disinfectants, but above all for respiratory protection.\nYeah. However, such masks make no sense, as the chairman of the German Society of Infectiology, Bernd Salzberger of the University Hospital Regensburg, stresses. The so-called surgical facial masks were not designed to protect against infections, but only to prevent infectious drops from the surgeon's breathing air from entering the surgical wound. \"But protection against an infection from the outside is very, very bad,\" Salzberger explains. Martin Hoch, head of the LGL Task Force on Infectiology, also emphasises that normal hand hygiene and cough labels are sufficient.\nIn its special unit there is a very specific alarm plan with several escalation stages for cases such as the current one. Step one: doctors across the country are informed and sensitised. This took place last week. With the first confirmed case, another escalation stage has been reached: for example, information screens are now being run at the airport, including in Chinese. Stage three is when controllers take a close look at the incoming passengers and measure the temperature by a distance thermometer.\nSuch measures are also discussed by the national health ministers. Subsequently, Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) informs the Tower of the state of health of passengers on flights from China prior to landing at German airports. Travellers from China should also fill out forms on how to reach them in the next thirty days so that contact persons can be identified in case of infection.\nIn the main country of China, more than 100 people have already died of the infection, most of which were elderly patients with severe pre-conditions. The total number of known diseases worldwide has now increased to more than 4500\nYeah.\nMany countries are bringing their citizens back from Wuhan, such as the UK, Belgium, Japan, South Korea, France and the USA. The Federal Government is also preparing an evacuation flight to fly volunteer Germans out of Wuhan.\nWith all due caution, those responsible keep making it clear:'In our opinion, the risk to human health in Germany remains low', as Minister of Health Spahn emphasises on Tuesday. \"There is no need for excessive concern.\"\nChief physician Wendtner also considers a completely different danger much greater. \"In my view, this case would be enough reason to put the prevention of influenza back in the foreground.\" Because even if in the next few weeks more people in Germany were to get the Coronavirus, the flu killed around 25.000 patients nationwide in the season 2017/2018.

        "news_content_translate_en": "HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - People across the globe are stockpiling facial masks to protect themselves from the new coronavirus, depleting online malls and store shelves from California to Beijing. Yet their efficacy against an outbreak that has claimed more than 130 lives remains uncertain. \n On Amazon and Alibaba, many shops peddling anti-virus masks had run out of stock as of Wednesday (Jan 29). Across China, Hong Kong and Singapore, people lined up for hours at stores and pharmacies hoping to secure dwindling supplies. People from San Francisco to Orlando said they were unable to find surgical masks at their usual outlets. \n While the rush is global, Chinese people living abroad have been buying masks - especially the popular N95 variant made by 3M - to send back to family members or resell them online, often via Tencent's WeChat messaging app. \n Demand is only likely to increase - even though doubts have surfaced among the medical community about their effectiveness in curbing the disease, which some doctors say can spread through physical contact. \n The coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 6,000 - more than the 5,327 cases officially reported in China during the Sars epidemic of 17 years ago. \n \"I've been running around town for days to buy masks,\" said Ms Liu Yan, a 36-year-old who works in the cryptocurrency industry in Tokyo. She scooped up 2,000 masks to send back to people in China without asking for additional money. \n She said she may stop buying soon because patient numbers were on the rise in Japan and she didn't want to deprive locals of supplies. \n While it is still unclear how the 2019-nCoV virus is spreading, one confirmed channel is through direct contact with infected people - most likely coming into contact with respiratory secretions or virus-containing droplets from an infected person's cough\n. It's also possible the virus could be shed in other ways, including through the fecal waste of acutely infected people. \n Good hand hygiene, including the regular use of an alcohol-based sanitiser, may be more effective than face masks at preventing transmission of the 2019-nCoV virus, said Dr Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Australia's Canberra Hospital. \n China's government has responded to the worsening shortage by cracking down on vendors who sell fake masks or overcharge online. Over 80 shops on e-commerce platform Taobao, run by Alibaba Group Holding, allegedly sold counterfeit 3M and N95 face masks, Chinese state-media reported on Monday. \n The company said on its official Weibo account that it removed shops found to engage in false advertising or price rigging. The e-commerce site said it sold 80 million face masks through Taobao within two days. \n In Hong Kong, some store chains have begun restricting sales. Watsons said on its official Facebook account it would receive a limited supply on Jan 30, then limit purchases to 50 masks per person on a first come first serve basis. People in the city who have tried to send masks to mainland China said their deliveries got bounced back without being given a clear reason. \n 3M said it is increasing output and working with distributors to ensure sufficient inventory to meet demand and supply existing customers, according to a representative. Other factories are ramping up production. In Japan, plants that supply personal care company Unicharm have been working around the clock since Jan 17 after orders increased tenfold, according to spokesman Hitoshi Watanabe.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "GENEVA (AFP) - Keen to avoid stigmatising the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, or Chinese people, the World Health Organisation (WHO) is treading carefully on naming the new coronavirus. \n The UN health agency's official temporary name for the disease, which it has designated as a global health emergency, is \"2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease\". \n The date refers to when it was first identified on Dec 31, 2019 and \"nCoV\" stands for \"novel coronavirus\" - the family of viruses it belongs to. \n \"We thought it was very important that we provide an interim name so that no location was associated with the name,\" Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's Emerging Diseases unit, told the agency's executive board on Friday (Feb 7). \n \"I'm sure you've all seen many media reports that are still calling it using Wuhan or China and we wanted to ensure that there was no stigma,\" she said. \n The final decision on a name is expected within days and is up to the WHO itself as well as coronavirus experts on the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). \n But picking a more specific name is fraught with dangers. \n Under a set of guidelines issued in 2015, WHO advises against using place names such as Ebola and Zika - where those diseases were first identified and which are now inevitably linked to them in the public imagination. \n Dr Sylvie Briand, head of WHO's Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, said this week that the use of a place name created \"an unnecessary burden\". \n More general names such as \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\" or \"Spanish flu\" are also to be avoided as they can stigmatise entire regions or ethnic groups\n. \n \"It is the responsibility of us all to ensure that there is no stigma associated with this disease, and the unnecessary and unhelpful profiling of individuals based on ethnicity is utterly and completely unacceptable,\" said Dr Michael Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme. \n The WHO also points out that using animal species in the name can create confusion such as H1N1, which was popularly referred to as \"swine flu\". \n This had a major effect for the pork industry even though the disease was being spread by people rather than pigs. \n H1N1 was also sometimes also called Mexican flu \"which was not very nice for Mexican people,\" Dr Briand said. \n People's names - usually the scientists who identified the disease - are also banned, as are \"terms that incite undue fear\" such as \"unknown\" or \"fatal\", the WHO said. \n \"We've seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and trigger needless slaughtering of food animals,\" the WHO said in its guidelines. \n Instead, it recommended that any new name should be descriptive and include the causative pathogen if known, as well as being short and easy to pronounce. \n \"We are really trying to be as neutral as possible, but as helpful as possible as well, because we need to name things with the same name everywhere in the world if we want to tackle the enemy in the same way,\" Dr Briand said.\n",

This new data increases the total number of deaths worldwide to 212. According to the Wuhei health authorities, the number of infected people in Chinese territory has also increased to 5806, aggregating 9320 cases of infection worldwide. 98 There are confirmed cases of infection outside China in at least 18 countries. There was also confirmation that the virus has already reached all Chinese provinces, including Tibet.\nThis Thursday, at least 6000 people were detained inside a cruise ship off Italy because they suspected that a couple might be infected with the new coronavirus, reported to Reuters. On suspicion were two passengers arriving from Macao to board the Smeralda Coast, which was docked at the port of Savona, and presenting flu-like symptoms. However, it confirmed the Italian Government at the beginning of the evening that the tests on the couple were negative.\nAlthough no case was detected on the cruise ship, Italy confirmed two cases on Thursday in the new coronavirus country and suspended all flights to or from China despite opposition to the restrictions on flights from the World Health Organisation (WHO). \"As in other countries, we have two confirmed cases of the new coronavirus. These are two Chinese tourists who arrived a few days ago [Italy],\"said the Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, quoted by the agency France-Presse, adding that the decision to close the Italian airspace to flights\"to and from\"to China was\"as a precaution\".\nItaly is the fourth European country to confirm cases of viral infection after France, Germany and Finland\nYeah. The new coronavirus has reached at least 18 countries in addition to China, including India and the Philippines, which have recorded the first cases in the last few hours.\nThe new coronavirus has also arrived in India: there is at least one positive case detected in the state of Kerala, according to a statement from the Indian health authorities. The Philippines has also confirmed its first case.\nIn both cases, infected people had travelled from the Wuhan province, the epicenter of the outbreak. In the Filipino case, the infected woman is 38-year-old and of Chinese origin. In the Indian case, the infected student was studying at the University of Wuhan, although it is not known when he returned from China to India. The student is currently under quarantine.\nAccording to the Indian Ministry of Health, all hospitals and health centers are prepared for a possible outbreak and airports are monitoring symptoms (such a s fever, cough or breathing difficulties) in all incoming passengers. The Indian Government is also planning two flights to repatriate citizens in Hubei Province, China. Only those citizens who are healthy will be transported.\nIt is not the only country to choose to repatriate its citizens. Japan and the US have already sent chartered flights to China in order to withdraw nationals from their countries. Australia is preparing to do the same and has already announced that the rescued nationals will be isolated on Christmas Island in quarantine. The arrival of planes from South Korea and the United Kingdom was delayed by the lack of authorisation from the Chinese authorities, writes The Guardian.\nIn Europe, the second Hi fly chartered flight to repatriate 350 people from several European states left Beja Airport at 10am this Thursday. This flight is expected to bring back the 17 Portuguese who have asked to leave China\nYeah. Italy and Germany also independently announced two flights\nIn response to the outbreak, Russia has chosen to close its border with China, reporting the South China Morning Post. Nor will any electronic visas be issued to Chinese nationals wishing to visit Russia from this Thursday.\n\"We must do everything to protect our population,\" said Prime Minister Mishustin, who also advises that all trips to China should be avoided.\nThe Macao Government also decided this Thursday to postpone the resumption of the lessons. The new date will be announced one week before the reopening of \"higher and non-higher education institutions (secondary, primary and child education) and the resumption of activities in the\"private complementary educational support centres and in continuing education institutions\".\nWithout giving a date, Kong Ngai, head of the education department in the semi-autonomous region of China, added that during suspension schools must \"use remote means\" to work and accompany students. Even cross-border pupils \"do not need to go to Macao\" and \"should stay home until school starts again\". Schools should \"cooperate\" with the Government of Macao and avoid crowding people and reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus.\nOn the other hand, Macao's health authorities have stated that the most recent cases of coronavirus in Zhuhai are people who have been in the territory and the routes of these patients are being checked. According to the Chinese National Health Commission, 26 confirmed cases of infection with the new coronavirus have been confirmed to date. Zhuhai is located in Guangdong Province (South China), the second with the largest number of cases in the country: 354\nYeah.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) decided this Thursday to classify the coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international interest, the most important signal the WHO can give the world. In order to declare a public health emergency of international interest (PHEIC) the situation under examination must meet three criteria: it must be an extraordinary event, with a risk of high public health risk from other countries and requiring a coordinated international response. This is the sixth time that the WHO has used this global alert instrument.\n\"In recent days the spread of the virus, especially in some countries and especially by the transmission of humans-to-humans, is worrying us,\" said the Director-General of OMS Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday, quoted by the BBC. In Germany, Vietnam and Japan, there are reports of people who have become infected without ever travelling to China: only by contact with other infected people. \"Even though the numbers outside China are relatively small, they have the potential to cause a much larger outbreak,\" he added.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAccording to a study published in the scientific journal The Lancet, which analyses at least 99 cases of the new coronavirus treated at Jinyintan hospital in Wuhan between 1 and 20 in January, at least 46 people had been on the Wuhan fish market. The average age of the infected is 55,5 years and most of them were male. The most common symptoms are fever and cough. At least 11 of the infected in this hospital died from organ failure. Researchers concluded that the infection affects older men more with other previous medical problems.\nWith Sofia Neves\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "JAKARTA/BOGOR, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesia is not hiding anything over the coronavirus, the health minister said on Tuesday, after some medical researchers expressed concern that cases may have gone undetected in the world’s fourth most populous country.\nWhile the virus has quickly spread from China throughout much of the rest of the region and beyond, the sprawling Southeast Asian country of more than 260 million people has not recorded any cases so far.\nDozens of cases have been recorded in other regional countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, where one person has died, raising suspicions on social media in particular over a potential lack of vigilance in Indonesia.\nResearchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, then said in a study last week that Indonesia should rapidly strengthen outbreak surveillance and control - especially given that it had direct flights from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.\nThe Harvard team said that Indonesia’s lack of confirmed cases “may suggest the potential for undetected cases” as air travel may contribute to cases being exported from China.\nThe virus has killed over 1,000, with more than 42,000 confirmed cases in China and 319 cases in 24 other countries. Many of the cases outside China have been in people who have a history of travelling to the country.\n“We have the kits to check coronavirus and they’re certified ... Nothing is concealed,” Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto said after a cabinet meeting at the Bogor presidential palace outside Jakarta, in response to the concerns.\nIndonesia has tested 64 samples from suspected coronavirus infections - 62 of which were declared negative with two still being tested, health ministry Research and development agency head Siswanto said during a tour of its laboratory in Jakarta.\nNavaratnasamy Paranietharan, the WHO’s Indonesia representative, told a conference on Tuesday: “Indonesia has taken concrete measures and the World Health Organization is quite confident that Indonesia is ready to be able to respond to this situation.”\nIndonesia has barred entry to visitors who have been in China for 14 days and stopped all flights to and from there.\nVivi Setiawaty, another health ministry official, said it was unclear why Indonesia had not seen any cases but said authorities were better prepared since facing H5N1 avian influenza from 2005. “We remain cautious,” she told reporters.\nIndonesia has readied 100 hospitals across the archipelago including three in Jakarta and has also quarantined more than 240 of its citizens evacuated from Hubei province, home to Wuhan, to the island of Natuna, north of Borneo.\nThe WHO’s Paranietharan said it appeared unlikely, as some have suggested, that the hot tropical climate could be a factor in curbing cases though more data would be required to be sure.\n“It doesn’t make sense at this point whether that could be the reason why we don’t have coronavirus cases in Indonesia,” Paranietharan said.\n",

But there were net purchases of both U.S. diesel (4 million) and U.S. gasoline (7 million).\nOverall, the last time the hedge fund community was this bearish towards petroleum was in early October, and before that January 2019, when concerns about a U.S./China trade-war driven recession were at their highest.\nFund managers hold less than three bullish long positions for every bearish short one, down from a recent peak ratio of almost 7:1 at the start of the year.\nThe ratio of long to short positions is towards the bottom of the range for the last four years, currently in the 19th percentile for all weeks since the start of 2016.\nMost of the bullish positions accumulated in the last quarter of 2019 in anticipation of a cyclical economic upswing and faster oil consumption growth in 2020 have now been liquidated.\nThe liquidation seems to have been mostly completed by the start of last week and it has been followed by a $4 per barrel rally in Brent prices.\nFrom a positioning perspective, the distribution of risks had shifted to the upside by the start of last week, with the potential for a significant increase in bullish positions and prices if the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control and China’s business activity returns to near normal.\nFrom a fundamental perspective, the balance of risks appears more symmetrical, with the possibility of a quick resumption of business activity matched by the risk of a deeper and longer lasting downturn if the outbreak spreads or triggers a renewed business cycle downturn.\nRelated columns:\n- Fuel consumption sinks on record warmth across northern hemisphere (Reuters, Feb. 14)\n- Falling air freight points to renewed global economic slowdown (Reuters, Feb. 13)\n- Hedge funds sell oil as coronavirus stokes recession fear (Reuters, Feb. 10)\n- Coronavirus and the impact on oil consumption (Reuters, Feb. 4) (Editing by Barbara Lewis)\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - American passengers were taken off a cruise liner on Sunday to fly home after being quarantined for two weeks off Japan, while China said the rate of new coronavirus cases had slowed, calling that proof its steps to fight the outbreak were working.\nAn announcement aboard the Diamond Princess, where 3,700 passengers and crew have been held since Feb. 3, told Americans to get ready to disembark on Sunday evening for charter flights home. Passengers wearing masks could later be seen waving through the windows of buses parked near the ship.\nOf the roughly 400 Americans on the cruise, more than 40 are infected with the virus and will stay in Japan for treatment, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n“They are not going to go anywhere. They’re going to be in hospitals in Japan,” Fauci told the CBS News program “Face the Nation.” “People who have symptoms will not be able to get on the evacuation plane. Others are going to be evacuated starting imminently to air force bases in the United States.”\nKyodo News Agency said the flights carrying U.S. passengers left Haneda Airport at around 1700 ET (2200 GMT).\nCanadian, Italian, South Korean and Hong Kong passengers were expected to follow soon, after their governments also announced plans to repatriate passengers.\n“Leaving in a few hours. No details. Might be going to Texas or Nebraska,” U.S. passenger Gay Courter told Reuters.\nSeventy new coronavirus cases were confirmed on board, bringing the total on the ship to 355, by far the largest cluster of cases outside China. Fauci told the Washington Post there were 44 infected Americans.\nWithin China, authorities reported 2,009 new cases on Sunday, noting that this was down from more than 2,600 the previous day. They said this showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit.\n“The effect of the coronavirus controls is appearing,” Mi Feng, spokesman for the Health Commission, told reporters.\nThe new cases brought the total to 68,500 in mainland China, with 1,665 deaths, including 143 fatalities reported on Sunday. Outside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who traveled from Chinese cities, with five deaths.\nThe coronavirus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in China’s central province of Hubei. China’s response has included putting Hubei and its capital Wuhan - a city of 11 million people - on virtual lockdown.\nMi said the proportion of confirmed cases who were critically ill had fallen to 21.6% on Saturday, from 32.4% on Jan. 27. He said this showed the authorities were able to treat patients more quickly, preventing cases from becoming critical.\nMark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Britain’s University of Edinburgh, said if the numbers suggested the epidemic has peaked in Hubei, “then this would be encouraging news for the rest of the world too”.\nBut he added: “We should be cautious though; it could simply be that reporting is not keeping up with events in circumstances where the health services are under enormous pressure.”\nDeclining numbers of reported new infections could mean the virus was being contained, but could also mean it was simply running out of susceptible new hosts in Wuhan, he said.\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.\nAfter an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But in some cities streets are still deserted.\nOn board the Diamond Princess, American passenger Matthew Smith posted a photo on Twitter showing buses parked on the shore to take U.S. nationals to the airport. American officials in hazmat suits and masks had visited his room to check if he would disembark. He said he wanted to stay.\nThe ship, owned by Carnival Corp., has been held in the port of Yokohama and those with the disease have been taken to hospital onshore. No one from the ship has died.\nCountries that have announced plans to fly their citizens home from the ship say they will take them only if they are symptom-free, and quarantine them on arrival.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense is preparing to receive two flights with passengers - one to land at Travis Air Force Base, California and the other at Kelly Field/Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.\nThe evacuees will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.\nAnother cruise ship, Holland America’s MS Westerdam, docked in Cambodia on Thursday after being rejected by ports elsewhere. An 83-year-old American passenger tested positive upon arriving in Malaysia, authorities there said. A second test requested by the cruise operator confirmed the finding.\nTaiwan reported its first fatality on Sunday. The first fatality in Europe was reported on Saturday, an 80-year-old Chinese man who died at a Paris hospital.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "New coronavirus cases in the Chinese province at the epicenter of the outbreak fell for a second straight day, but deaths rose after the World Health Organization had cautioned there was not yet enough data to know if the epidemic had slowed.\nHubei reported 1,693 new cases as of Tuesday, down from 1,807 the previous day and the lowest number in the province since February 11. But deaths rose by 132, up from 93 the previous day. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 with about 2,000 deaths.\nThe head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the novel virus first appeared at the end of last year.\nIllustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc (AAPL.O) issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains.\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data \"appears to show a decline in new cases\" but any apparent trend \"must be interpreted very cautiously.\"\nOutside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.\n\"We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nRussia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens.\nBy the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.\n\"Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\nChina says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.\nThe WHO's Mike Ryan said China had success with \"putting out the fire\" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored.\n\"Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,\" Mike Ryan said\nThe numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.\nChinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.\nGLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS\nDespite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China's ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be \"limited, short-term and manageable\" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.\nChinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.\nEconomists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.\n\"The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,\" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.\nBritain's biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.\nComponents made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world, and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.\nSingapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.\nJapan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.\n",

Car makers are idling plants for lack of parts.\nThe yield curve between U.S. three-month bills and 10-year notes inverted overnight, a bearish economic signal, and German investor confidence slumped as its economy stagnates, sending the euro cheaper than $1.08 for the first time since 2017.\n“The market is trying to model itself on coronavirus and it’s struggling really hard to understand how that goes and that’s pushing capital in to the U.S.,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Melbourne brokerage Pepperstone.\n“The U.S. remains that least-dirty T-shirt, the best house in a fairly shabby-looking neighbourhood. As a destination for capital, it’s still the light that you look for.”\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the greenback is sitting by a four-month high at 99.452. It touched a one-week high against the Australian and New Zealand dollars overnight.\nBoth Antipodean currencies are heavily exposed to China, and both have lost roughly 5% against the dollar this year . Norway’s krone, sensitive to the global growth outlook via oil exports, has shed 6% in 2020 and slumped to an 18-year low overnight.\nThe euro has fallen 3.7% amid increasing signs of divergence between the European and U.S. economies.\nThe single currency last bought $1.0796. Moves in major currencies were slight in morning trade.\nChina says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show the aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.\nThat has not stopped worries mounting, with hedge funds turning to proxies from railway movements to port activity and air pollution to try and gauge how much production remains offline.\nGold is sitting above $1,600 an ounce for the first time since U.S.-Iran tensions in the Middle East sent it spiking in early January. Priced in euros, gold’s value jumped almost 2% to a record high overnight.\nInvestors are looking to the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, due to be released at 1900 GMT, for insight in to the Fed’s thinking about virus risks.\nEuropean purchasing managers index numbers and part-month Korean export figures, both due on Friday, are also going to be closely watched for the first hard signs of economic impact.\n“We assess the risks are firmly skewed towards the negative effects of COVID-19 lasting longer,” Nomura analysts wrote in a note, using the World Health Organisation’s designation for the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n“Therefore, we maintain our cautious view through positions in long USD/THB, long USD/CNH, long USD vs GBP, NZD and long AUD/NZD.”\nChina’s yuan was last steady at 7.0017 per dollar in offshore trade.

The WHO has declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, or PHEIC. The same alert was issued for Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo last year, and for Zika in 2016.\nYou can use the links below to navigate.\nLet's begin.\nWhat are coronaviruses?\nSECTION SNAPSHOT\nThe novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is part of a family of viruses named for the effect created by spike proteins on their shells, or capsids. Think of how the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere, known as the corona (Latin for crown), appears during a total solar eclipse.\nCoronaviruses are initially transmitted from animals to humans. Human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 has been confirmed.\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus infections?\nSECTION SNAPSHOT\nHere's what the World Health Organisation (WHO) says about Covid-19 symptoms.\nAre there specific medicines that can be used to treat the infection? Again, hear it from the WHO:\nHow dangerous is Covid-19?\nSECTION SNAPSHOT\nOn January 30, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\", or PHEIC, after initially deciding against issuing such an alert.\nMore than 2,300 people have died so far, almost all of them in China. The death toll is higher than the number of fatalities caused by the SARS pandemic (774) between 2002 and 2003.\nThe infections have spread to several countries across multiple continents. The number rose sharply in a very short timespan, as the Reuters interactive below shows. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed.\nThe WHO says the first vaccine is a year and a half away.\nWhere did the current outbreak begin?\nSECTION SNAPSHOT\nThe outbreak of Covid-19 has been linked to the Huanan Seafood Market in the Chinese city of Wuhan (currently under a lockdown), where wildlife was being sold illegally. Remember, coronaviruses are initially transmitted between animals and humans.\nReports by TIME and the Wall Street Journal say the market sold all kinds of wildlife, from ostriches to porcupines.\nCommunist Party leaders in charge of Wuhan city and Hubei province have been removed from office, Chinese state media reported on February 13.\nWhat precautions should you take?\nSECTION SNAPSHOT\nThe WHO has put of a list of precautions that can help reduce the risk of a coronavirus infection. Check out the infographic above for a brief overview.\nIndia has asked its citizens not to travel to China. Anyone with a travel history in China since January 15, 2020 could be quarantined, the ministry said on February 2, adding that the rule would apply to current and future travel to China.\nIf you develop fever, cough or breathing difficulties with 28 days of returning from China, you must:\nWhat is India doing to monitor the threat?\nSECTION SNAPSHOT\nIndia has evacuated over 600 of its citizens from Wuhan on two flights, and says all evacuees have tested negative.\nThree positive cases have been found in India, all of them in Kerala. All of them have been discharged and are in home quarantine, the government says.\nEight Indians aboard a cruise ship that was quarantined off the coast of Japan have also tested positive.\nThe national helpline for information and assistance related to the coronavirus threat is 011-23978046.\nIndia has cancelled visas for all foreign nationals travelling from China.\nCoronavirus: WHO busts myths\nCan your pet be infected by the new coronavirus infection? Does Covid-19 affect only the elderly?\nExperts slam India's homeopathy push\nExperts have criticised the Ministry of AYUSH's suggestion that homeopathy and unani can be used to prevent or manage coronavirus infections.\nThere's no evidence that homeopathy can cure viral infections or that the unani drugs prescribed by the government can reduce virulence, said an Australian neuroscientist and science fact-checker with AltNews.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "A shadowy church in South Korea has become the focus of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. At the heart of it is a 60-year-old coronavirus patient who may have come in contact with nearly 1200 people.\nAs South Korea battles to control the viral infection, the role of a religious congregation has come under the scanner.\nOn Sunday, the East Asian nation reported 123 new confirmed coronavirus cases and a fourth death from the virus, taking total infections to 556.\nMore than half the additional cases were found to be linked to a Shincheonji Church of Jesus congregation in the southeastern city of Daegu after a 61-year-old woman known as \"Patient 31\" who attended services at the church tested positive for the virus last week.\nWhat makes Patient 31 special? The woman had no recent record of overseas travel.\nWhile authorities call her \"super spreader\", the locals have dubbed her \"crazy ajumma (Korean for aunty)\". Diagnosed with pneumonia-like symptoms on February 18, the sexagenarian resisted doctors’ recommendations to get tested for coronavirus not once but twice.\nAunty's day out\nThe Daegu woman's story is nothing short of a Hollywood-style caper but the reality is quite grim. She was first admitted to a local hospital after an accident on February 7. While in hospital, she developed a fever but refused to get tested.\nShe was finally tested on February 17 and a day later was diagnosed with coronavirus.\nBut between first entering the hospital and finally being confirmed positive for COVID-19, Patient 31 stepped out on at least four different occasions. All very public places.\nFrom a buffet restaurant to a Korean-style public bath and then to church twice, Patient 31 is estimated to have come in contact with some 1,160 people.\nSouth Korean authorities are now pressed as they deal with the ramifications of the woman's trip around Daegu.\nChurch becomes epicentre\nThe biggest spread came from her attendance of the Sunday services at a branch of the mysterious Shincheonji Church of Jesus.\nSome 1,000 Shincheonji church followers who attended Sunday services with her have been quarantined at their homes while authorities screen them for the virus. Health authorities are also trying to monitor thousands of others.\nThe Shincheonji church blamed the woman for the spread of the disease, saying it has been advising followers since late January to stay home if they had travelled overseas or were experiencing even mild cold-like symptoms.\nHealth officials were screening some 9,300 church followers and said that 1,261 of them have exhibited cough and other symptoms. The authorities are scrambling to find churchgoers because many followers don't reveal their affiliation owing to the sect's reputation.\nAll 74 sites operated by the Shincheonji Church have been closed and churchgoers have been told to instead watch services online for a sect whose leader claims to be an angel of Christ, but who is dismissed by many outsiders as a cult leader.\nIts teachings revolve largely around the Book of Revelation, a chapter of the New Testament known mostly for its apocalyptic foreshadowing.\nAuthorities are trying to determine how Patient 31 contracted coronavirus given that she had no travel history with China. Now, church members have admitted to conducting evangelical missions with Koreans in northeastern China, some of whom were invited to South Korea.\nOfficials are also investigating a possible link between churchgoers and the spike in infections at the Cheongdo hospital, where many have been infected, mostly patients at a mental illness ward. The hospital has also recorded South Korea's fourth death from coronavirus.\nChurch or Doomsday cult?\nShincheonji, which translates as new heaven and new earth, was established in 1984 by Lee Man-hee, who has been accused by other Christian groups as a false prophet or a cult leader.\nThe church describes Lee as the Promised Pastor, an attendant of Jesus sent to testify what he claims are the fulfilled prophecies from the Book of Revelation. The church boasts of a membership of more than 1,50,000.\nShincheonji followers believe Lee Man-hee is immortal and has an eternal life, said Ji-il Tark at Busan Presbyterian University in South Korea.\nTo propagate their belief, they often approach their relatives and acquaintances or sneak to other churches without telling them they are Shincheonji members.\nTark said Shincheonji followers are likely more vulnerable to virus infections as they often sit very closely on the floor during services. At Shincheonji, attending church-related gatherings isn’t an option, but a requirement, he said.\nRituals followed at Shincheonji may have further exacerbated the spread of the virus as church members are expected to kneel 10cm apart and hold hands with each other.\nOne member told New York Times that churchgoers are restricted from wearing glasses or masks in premises.\nAlso a part of training? Not fearing diseases. For members of Shincheonji, getting sick is a \"sin\" because it \"prevents them from doing God’s work\".\nShincheonji founder Lee has termed coronavirus, \"an act of the devil who saw the rapid growth of Shincheonji and wants to destroy our advancement.\"\nAfter Patient 31's diagnosis was confirmed, the church is allegedly said to have told followers to continue their mission in small groups and deny any affiliation -- a charge that was denied officially.\nInterestingly, the Shincheonji also claims to have a big congregation in China's Wuhan -- the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (here) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:\n* Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.\n* Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.\n* COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.\n* A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.\n* They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.\n* Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.\n* The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was “too early” to speak of a pandemic.\n* Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.\n* Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with “crown”-like spikes.\n* Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.\n* Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a “recombinant” virus strain.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L) said on Friday that coronavirus would hit its earnings this year but it wasn’t sure by how much, becoming the latest airline to warn about the impact of the rapidly evolving outbreak.\nCoronavirus, which emerged late last year in China, has sent demand for travel plunging in recent weeks as the outbreak has spread around the world. Airlines are flying blind into a crisis of unknown severity and duration.\nIAG, which also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus, usually gives an earnings forecast at this time of year but said the uncertainty of the impact and duration of coronavirus meant it could not give accurate profit guidance at this stage.\n“It’s a rapidly changing situation,” Chief Executive Willie Walsh told reporters on Friday. “I wouldn’t call it unprecedented. We have seen other challenges for the industry.”\nBritish Airways has in recent days canceled flights to and from Italy, Singapore and South Korea, after it suspended all direct flights to China in January. IAG said further cancellations would follow in the coming days.\nBritish budget airline easyJet (EZJ.L) also warned on Friday that it had seen “significant” softening of demand for travel to Italy and other European markets and would cancel flights and cut costs. Finland’s Finnair (FIA1S.HE) also warned of a significant fall in profit.\nThe rapid spread of coronavirus has sent shockwaves through the global economy, hammering corporate supply chains, curbing travel, cancelling conferences and sporting events, and wiping tens of billions of pounds off financial markets.\nShare prices were on track for their worst week since the global financial crisis in 2008 and IAG’s is down 25% since the middle of January. On Friday it fell a further 8% to 474 pence.\nThe outbreak in Italy over the last week has brought new disruption to short-haul European travel but Walsh said IAG, with its strong balance sheet, was well-placed to withstand it.\n“I’m very confident that we’ll navigate our way through these challenges,” said Walsh, overseeing his last quarterly results announcement before new boss Luis Gallego takes over on March 26.\nBernstein analyst Daniel Roeska backed Walsh’s thinking: “We are also confident that a downturn would reveal the strength of the IAG model.”\nIAG said it was cutting costs and implementing revenue initiatives, which included looking at all discretionary spending, to help it weather the storm. That’s in line with moves by Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) and Amsterdam-based KLM which have both cut costs in recent days.\nIAG said flight cancellations due to falling demand would hit its 2020 capacity growth though Walsh said it could start adding capacity if other airlines fail and that the group was in a strong position to benefit from any recovery.\nThe company also said its acquisition of Air Europa remained on track for completion later this year and was not affected by the coronavirus outbreak.\nFor 2019, IAG reported a 5.7% drop in operating profit to 3.285 billion euros, slightly ahead of a downgraded forecast of 3.27 billion euros it gave in September when it said a pilots strike would result in a 215 million euros hit.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\nBy Peter Apps\nLONDON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - As the coronavirus outbreak turns global, stock markets and world populations are waking up to the threat of a global pandemic. That, though, hasn’t been the only disturbing global news this week. In the Middle East and Asia in particular, military tensions are on the rise – and major countries seem ever less bothered about taking off the gloves.\nMost worrying, arguably, were events over the last 24 hours in Syria. As that civil war enters its final throes, Russia and Turkey have been increasingly at loggerheads. The killing of 33 Turkish soldiers in an apparent Syrian government air strike on Thursday took that confrontation into untested territory, with Ankara now furious at not just Moscow and Damascus but also Western nations it believes have abandoned it.\nOn Friday, Turkey said it would no longer stop Syrian refugees from making their way to Europe, threatening a return of the mass population moves last seen in 2015-16. Then, the arrival of hundreds of thousands in Europe fuelled considerable popular discontent, powering the rise of right-wing parties. That comes against a backdrop of further confrontation between Syria and Israel, with Israeli helicopters reportedly injuring several Syrian personnel in attacks along the border.\nTensions and violence between Iran and its regional enemies in the Gulf are also arguably at an all-time high, even if the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani does appear to have deterred direct regional escalation. In eastern Ukraine, Russian troops have been on the offensive again around the town of Luhansk. And in the South China Sea, this week saw Chinese forces target a U.S. plane with what was described as a military laser, prompting angry complaints from Washington.\nDrawing a direct line between these confrontations and the virus outbreak is almost certainly a step too far, although the Chinese government in particular might welcome a distraction from the outbreak. So might Iran, already home to one of the largest outbreaks outside Asia, and where popular discontent with the government has also been on the rise. What is more unarguably the case, however, is that the resources governments will need to plough into tackling the disease will likely prove a potent distraction from events elsewhere.\nWhat that will mean will be different in different places – and the long-term legacy may be distinctly different from the short-term consequences. In Hong Kong, worries over the virus seem to have dramatically reduced protests against the government in Beijing. But they have also dramatically intensified anger and frustration with the mainland, which many Hong Kong residents see as mishandling the disease and exporting it to the city.\nIf, as seems increasingly likely, the virus outbreak dramatically dents global economic growth, perhaps even producing a recession, that will likely raise the political temperature almost everywhere.\nMuch, of course, will depend on how serious the outbreak proves. Particularly deadly outbreaks of disease have traditionally limited wars, at least their duration, decimating armies and leaving populations too weak to stomach serious conflict. Already, an outbreak in South Korea has prompted the United States to cancel planned military drills.\nWhether coronavirus is truly enough to force nations towards an even temporary peace, however, may well be in doubt. What does look increasingly probable, is that it will affect millions and perhaps kill hundreds of thousands in multiple countries around the world.\nGeopolitical confrontation invariably makes tackling such outbreaks harder, and the effect of conflict – and particularly mass population moves – can help their spread. Most notable would be the Spanish flu outbreak that swept the world following World War One. The death toll of that outbreak – believed to have affected up to a quarter of the global population - is estimated at between 40-100 million.\nIf coronavirus does go global, it is still not impossible that will drive countries together rather than apart. At worst, though, it may simply further undermine the already deteriorating trust millions of people around the world have in their leaders and institutions to protect them. That’s a recipe for further global instability, just as the world can afford it least. *** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues.

He was 71.\nThe council advises Khamenei, as well as settles disputes between the supreme leader and parliament.\nHis death comes as other top officials have contracted the virus in Iran, which has the highest death toll in the world after China, the epicenter of the outbreak.\nTrying to stem the outbreak of the new coronavirus, Iran on Monday held an online-only briefing by its Foreign Ministry as Britain began evacuating nonessential staff and families from the country which has the highest death toll from the virus outside of China.\nIran has reported 978 confirmed cases of the new virus with 54 deaths from the illness it causes, called COVID-19. Across the wider Mideast, there are over 1,150 cases of the new coronavirus, the majority of which are linked back to Iran.\nExperts worry Iran's percentage of deaths to infections, around 5.5%, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be much higher than current figures show.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi opened the online news conference addressing the outbreak, dismissing an offer of help for Iran by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\nIran and the US have seen some of the worst tensions since its 1979 Islamic Revolution in recent months, culminating in the American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and a subsequent Iranian ballistic missile counterattack against U.S. forces.\n\"We neither count on such help nor are we ready to accept verbal help,\" Mousavi said. He added Iran has always been \"suspicious\" about America's intentions and accused the US government of trying to weaken Iranians' spirits over the outbreak.\nThe British Embassy meanwhile has begun evacuations over the virus.\n\"Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain,\" the British Foreign Office said. \"In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.\"\nWhile Iran has closed schools and universities to stop the spread of the virus, major Shiite shrines have remained open despite civilian authorities calling for them to be closed.\nThe holy cities of Mashhad and Qom in particular, both home to shrines, have been hard-hit by the virus.

Noura al-Moteari later described the tweet as \"satire\" to The Associated Press after it gained widespread attention.\nThe Dubai Media Office similarly described the tweet as being written in a \"cynical style\" while distancing the Arabic-language daily from al-Moteari.\n\"Noura is a freelance writer and is not an employee of Al-Bayan nor does she represent the publication's views,\" it told the AP. \"That being said, this has no relevance to any social media policy being practiced by the publication nor the state.\"\nThe tweet comes after Qatar expressed disappointment Sunday that nearly all of its Gulf neighbors snubbed invitations to attend the weekend peace signing ceremony between the US and the Taliban.\n",

It is not known how the man in his 50s was infected.\nAmid fears of a widespread outbreak, Attorney-General Christian Porter said Australia will expand the use of a rarely used law that would either designate some places as out of bounds or place the patient in home detention.\n“Under the biosecurity act, you could have the prevention of movement from persons in and out of particular places,” Porter told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n“You might have a major sporting event where people would be in very, very close proximity to each other and... it might be determined that the risk of transmission at a venue like that was too high.”\nThe law, enacted in 2015, has rarely been used outside Australia’s agricultural sector.\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison last week said a pandemic was likely and Australia has moved to try and prevent the virus from reaching its shores.\nSince Feb. 1 Australia has stopped any foreigner from entering directly from China - its largest trading partner. The move has prevented thousands of students and tourists from entering Australia.\nSome Chinese students have traveled to a third country for two weeks, the incubation period for the coronavirus, which satisfies Australia’s quarantine restrictions.\nOne Chinese student who spent two weeks in Dubai was on Tuesday confirmed as Australia’s 34th case of coronavirus.\nAustralia has had one death, a 78-year-old man who was a former passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which was quarantined in Japan.\nKeen to temper fears, Morrison urged Australians to remain calm as some rushed to shops to stock up on supplies in case of a pandemic or restrictions of movement.\nMorrison said he has spoken with Australia’s two largest retailers, Coles (COL.AX) and Woolworths (WOW.AX).\n“They would send the same message I am sending you today. It is important that people just go about their business and their normal processes in a calm manner,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. public health officials said they have identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signaling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a statement on Friday citing three such cases newly diagnosed by state public health authorities - one each in California, Oregon and Washington state.\nIf confirmed by the CDC, together with a previous case of unknown origin announced on Wednesday in California, that would bring to four the number of diagnosed individuals in the United States with no history of travel to a country where the virus is circulating and no close contact with an infected person.\nThe three latest patients were diagnosed based on results obtained in their respective states from CDC-supplied test kits and are considered “presumptive positive” cases pending CDC confirmatory testing, the U.S. agency said.\nA fourth presumptive positive was also announced in Washington state on Friday, but that one is “likely travel-related,” the CDC said.\nStill, the three latest cases of apparent community transmission, plus the one identified earlier this week in California, are a sign the virus is now spreading within at least four separate locations up and down the U.S. West Coast.\nThey span nearly 900 miles from California’s Silicon Valley region in Santa Clara County north to the Puget Sound near Seattle.\n“What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don’t know to what degree,” said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief public health officer for Santa Clara County, speaking of the newly diagnosed case there, the latest of three in her county and the 10th statewide.\nEven as confirmation was pending there, the CDC sent a team to assist local authorities in tracing close contacts the patient had with others in a bid to curb transmission.\nUntil this week, the CDC had counted 15 confirmed cases in six states as having been detected through the U.S. public health system since Jan. 21, none fatal. Most were contracted by individuals while traveling in China, where the outbreak originated. Only two person-to-person transmissions were documented among them, both between married couples.\nAn additional 47 cases have been confirmed among people recently repatriated from abroad, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan or from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak, according to the CDC.\nThe latest flurry of cases came as the Trump administration said the United States would invoke a federal defense law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items needed to protect medical personnel from exposure.\nAround the world, more countries are reporting new infections, companies have curtailed travel and global stock markets have tumbled.\nPresident Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday the United States will decide “very soon” about whether to bar entry to travelers from countries other than China where community transmission has emerged.\nAt a rally in South Carolina on Friday night, Trump defended his administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak and accused Democrats of politicizing the disease.\n“This is their new hoax,” Trump said at the event, held a day before the state’s Democratic presidential primary.\nThe U.S. State Department has issued travel advisories for several nations and on Friday it said Americans should reconsider travel to Italy, where nearly 900 coronavirus cases have been confirmed. A similar warning was issued earlier this week for South Korea, which has hundreds of infections.\nA government task force appointed by Trump to deal with the threat will meet at the White House on Saturday morning, according to an administration official.\nLatest figures from China, where the outbreak started late last year, indicated that nearly 80,000 people have been infected, with more than 2,800 deaths. The World Health Organization reported 57 deaths in 46 other countries.\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a closed-door briefing in the U.S. House of Representatives that sustained spread of the coronavirus meant there would be many more infections in the United States, according to a source.\nFauci warned lawmakers the country lacked enough testing resources, the source said on condition of anonymity. The CDC said it has revised its criteria for who should be tested and is ramping up testing capabilities.\n“Our goal is to have every state and local health department online and doing their own testing by the end of next week,” CDC official Nancy Messonier told reporters.\nA vaccine may take up to 18 months to develop, health officials have said.\nThe United States has decided to postpone a meeting with leaders of Southeast Asian countries it had planned to host on March 14 in Las Vegas because of worries about the outbreak.\nU.S. and global stocks plummeted as rattled investors braced for the prospect that a pandemic could further dent an already slowing world economy.\nThe S&P 500 .SPX fell for the seventh straight day on Friday, suffering its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Stocks cut losses right at the end of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 1.4%.\nTrump this week said the coronavirus risk to Americans remained “very low,” but he has been increasingly alarmed by the reaction of the U.S. stock market, which he considers a barometer of the economy’s health.\n(GRAPHIC - Tracking the novel coronavirus: here)\n",

Coughing (54 percent) and fever (40 percent) were among the most common symptoms in Germany, according to data from more than 22.000 patients.\n\"It is a rumor that a Sars CoV-2 infection definitely does not cause a flu,\" says Martin Witzenrath of the Charite Berlin Hospital for Infectiology and Pneumology, where he says more than 20 patients are currently treated with different severe conditions.\nFDP politician Alexander Graf Lambsdorff told the Heidelberg \"Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung\" that the disease had been wave-like. He had some cold sores for a while, so cough was added. He described the symptoms as \"not spectacularYeah.\nAs around 100 people in the particularly affected Heinsberg district of North Rhine-Westphalia have been found in domestic isolation, teams around Bonn virologist Hendrik Streeck have asked: \"The most commonly described symptom was dry irritation with 70 percent, before the loss of sense of taste and smell with 68 percent and fatigue with 68 percent,\"he says. But many patients also reported \"runny nose\", headache, muscle and throat pain, and fever. \"Some of them were pretty good,\" says the scientist. Even diarrhoea was not uncommon, Streeck said.\nAccording to World Health Organisation (WHO) data, mild disease progression lasts on average two weeks. According to Streeck, the disease begins after previous experience with neck scrapes or pain and often fever. And with it, like many cold diseases. Is there any indication that Covid-19 can be clearly distinguished? \"The only thing that does not cause flu is this loss of taste and smell,\" says Streeck. Otherwise, in mild cases, \"It is like a flu-like infection. Those affected would not have noticed the Sars-CoV-2 infection at all.\"\nChief physician Clemens Wendtner of the Munich Infectiology Clinic Schwabing, which treated the first infected in Germany at the end of January, also reports, For example, patients could not smell and taste well for several days and felt the taste of food, although their desired dish, as metallic or bitter. According to Wendtner, the impairment may occur at the very beginning and may be the first indication of a disease. Sars, too, was believed to infect scent receptors in the nose.\nHeavy procedures with hospital treatment:\nIt is not known how many people in Germany are hospitalized or have been hospitalized because of Covid-19. In cases of scarcely 56.000 recorded in China, 14 percent was difficulYeah. At six percent, the course was critical to life-threatening, for example due to lung failure. According to the WHO, heavy runs could last between three and six weeks on average.\nIn patients with symptoms of the upper respiratory tract it takes four to eight days to decide whether the disease also affects the lower respiratory tract, says Witzenrath of the Charite. However, there are also patients who get pneumonia directly without first affecting the upper respiratory tract. Inflammatory pulmonary tissue means the oxygen intake is no longer working so well.\nItalian doctors have indicated that there are some patients in the affected country who visit a clinic too late. RKI chief Wieler said on Wednesday, if you feel increasing breathlessness, you should consult a doctor.\nAccording to Witzenrath, the disease picture in Covid-19 differs significantly from the previously known pneumonia. \"The special thing about patients is that they sometimes have a bit of a shortage of air, not dramatic, they do not seem particularly ill at all. Then you look at the lung in the CT and it looks really bad. For example, more than half of the lung could have been damaged by the virus. The course could then deteriorate rapidly.\nThe doctor calls the alarm signals: \"If you go up a staircase that you otherwise can handle easily, and after half notice that you clearly can't breathe, that should be thoughtful. Especially when you are older, you have a history of illness.\"Relatives could keep an eye on the respiratory frequency of patients: while the patient is lying in front of the TV, for example, one can\"best observe\"how often the chest is lifting unnoticed. \"If the number is quiet over 20 or 22 per minute, this is definitely a warning signa\"\nSome Covid-19 patients could be treated at normal stations first, Witzenrath says. \"For example, people who are supported by oxygen through a small plastic tube under the nose, and patients whose pre-illness worsens under pneumonia,\" the physician explains.\nIf patients need more oxygen, a certain oxygen therapy (High Flow) is also used in intensive care. If this is no longer sufficient, breathing through a tube in the trachea is necessary, patients will be put into a coma. \"However, complications can occur with the duration of intubation,\" Witzenrath says. According to the data available so far, it is assumed that those affected must be ventilated in intensive care centres on average 17-day. \"This is very, very long.\"\nAccording to experts, the proportion of patients who need to be ventilated is difficult to say, even because of the dark number of unknown infections. The RKI calls for China: two to six percent. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The number of confirmed infections has risen sharply again following the new census of viral outbreaks in China. Only in the severely affected province of Hubei in Central China were added 4823 proven infections within one day.\nThis increases the number to almost 64.000 throughout the country. In Hubei, only 116 patients died of the disease, as the provincial Health Commission reports on state television. This causes almost 1400-year-old deaths throughout the country. Experts, however, also look at the new figures with caution and fear a high dark number.\nThe newly submitted statistics also caused confusion at first. According to its own information, the National Health Commission deducted cases from the previous day from the national aggregate statistics because it counted Hubei figures twice. The day before yesterday there had been excitement because the number of newly confirmed infections had increased dramatically by 15.000. The reason was the new counting method, which also included the clinical diagnoses of the Covid-19 lung disease mentioned in recent weeks.\nBecause the DNA tests in the laboratory often fail to detect the infection, cases of pneumonia, fever, respiratory problems and other typical Covid-19 symptoms are now also included, and therefore a diagnosis of the infection can be made without a laboratory test.\nIn the 4823 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus mentioned on Friday in Hubei, 3095 such cases with only clinical diagnosis were also included, as reported by the Provincial Health Commission. However, the new census is only applied in Hubei, not in the rest of the country. This will allow patients to be treated more appropriately and prevent further spread of the virus more effectively.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) welcomed the new approacYeah. It allows people in Hubei to be isolated and treated more quickly and allows contact persons to be observed earlier. As hospitals in Hubei and their medical staff are completely overwhelmed by the high number of patients, more than 21.000 medical professionals from other parts of the country have already been sent to the crisis region, as Xinhua News Agency reported.\nWith the return wave of tens of millions of Chinese returning to their jobs after the extended New Year holidays due to the epidemic, concerns are growing about the further spread of the virus. According to Chinese press reports, an infection was detected in a member of the cleaning staff on a high-speed train, which raised concerns about infections on the train.\nOutside mainland China, more than two dozen countries around 580 are confirmed, most in Japan. There was an accumulation of more than 200 cases on the cruise ship \"Diamond Princess\" located outside Yokohama. Asian countries are therefore reluctant to allow cruise ships to enter their ports. For example, the Aidavita, with around 1100 passengers mostly from Germany and 400 crew members, could not start as planned in Vietnam. The shipping company insisted there were no virus outbreaks on board. Nor did the ship enter a Chinese port.\nIn Germany 16 infections have been detected. The first patient was able to leave a Bavarian clinic on Thursday as cured. In Bavaria, 13-infected people are still being treated, all of them related to the car supplier Webasto. A Chinese employee had planted the virus there. Two infected Wuhan returnees are also housed in the Frankfurt University Clinic, a clinic spokesman said.\nIn addition to the infected, more than 100 people are under quarantine in GermanyYeah. At present 122 people are staying in a barracks in the Palatinate Germersheim, which had been taken from the heavily afflicted Chinese city of Wuhan in early February. When her quarantine is lifted, it will be decided on Sunday. In Berlin, around 20-more Wuhan returnees are isolated. A second test had also shown no infections.\nThe consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak for Germany are difficult to estimate. \"We are currently unable to predict the dynamics of the outbreak,\" said the president of Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lothar Wieler, on Thursday in Berlin. Virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charite said the pathogen Sars-CoV-2 multiplies like the flu virus in the throat, making it more contagious than initially suspected. Everyone should learn about the disease and ask themselves, for example, how people with basic family diseases can be protected.\nIn China, the statistical death rate is approximately two percent, except for 0.2 percent, said Wieler. Special risk groups are elderly patients. (dpa",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The new Coronavirus threatens the German economy massively. The industry expects a \"stress test\" and fears \"noticeable negative effects\". Stocks are slipping into the basement.\nIn an already weakened economic situation in Germany, lung disease threatens to become a \"real economic inhibitor\", warns the Chamber of Industry and Commerce on Thursday. Already now, the internationally strongly networked German export industry is feeling that the Coronavirus is burdening global trade and companies have been holding back their investment projects in many locations.\nFederal Minister of Economy Peter Altmaier (CDU) did not rule out that the Coronavirus could have \"foreseeable effects\" on the previous growth forecasts.\n\"The spread of the Coronavirus will significantly affect the German economy this year,\" said DIHK chief of foreign economics Volker Treier. \"Production failures at Chinese and German companies in China, massive travel restrictions and trade breaks between China and Asian neighboring countries, as well as demand failures in tourism and retail are likely scenarios that can affect the economy also in Germany and Europe.\"\nAltmeier said the Ministry of Economic Affairs was determined to act calmly and calmly. He does not expect large-scale supply bottlenecks. However, uncertainty in the economy had increased. Altmaier envisioned a counter-tax from the Federal Government in the event of a massive expansion of the Coronavirus affecting the economy.\nGerman and other foreign companies operating in China are already struggling. The German and European Chambers of Commerce in China concluded that the overall impact is bad following a survey among member companies. Almost 90-percent reported \"moderate to severe effects\" due to lung diseasYeah. \"Everyone is affected,\" says the chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce in North China, Stephan Wollenstein, in Beijing.\nEach second company would have to correct the business objectives for the year. Thus, almost half of the companies expect a two-digit percentage drop in revenue in the first half of the year. A quarter even expects more than 20 percent decline. A good third already have problems with their finances today. \"People do not make money by selling something, but have to pay rent and wages at the same time,\" said Wollenstein.\nIt is precisely small and medium-sized enterprises that are suffering from lung disease. \"Some of them already have to fight to hold on,\" said the head of the European Chamber of Commerce, Jurg Wuttke. The crisis could last longer than expected, as the head of the expert commission of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said. He expects the epidemic in China to be \"largely under control by the end of April\".\nUnfortunately, the virus is still spreading in Europe. The fear is that, as in Beijing, the international car fair will now be cancelled in Geneva, for example, in April. The otherwise travelled Germans are uncertain, hesitating with their holiday plans. \"The longer the crisis persists, the more the travel industry will be affected,\" said Norbert Fiebig, president of the DRV branch association in Frankfurt.\n\"The uncertainty about the effects of the virus is great,\" said BDI chief manager Joachim Lang in Berlin. China is the largest German trading partner. Now, economic crisis management by the federal government is also required. \"The effects of the virus are clearly visible in the global economy and the export-oriented German industry.\" The Chinese companies worked under pressure to reduce dependencies and minimise concentration risksYeah.\nThe immediate challenges for companies in China are, first of all, unpredictable regulations, quarantine requirements and extensive conditions for restarting operations after the extended break since the Chinese New Year's Festival. \"The patchwork of conflicting regulations that the fight against Covid-19 has produced hundreds of different areas of power that make it almost impossible to move goods or people in China,\" said EU Chamber President Wuttke.\n\"China is facing a delicate balancing act with two important but divergent objectives: to rigorously maintain measures to prevent the virus while fighting for a return to economic normality,\" said contraart Wollenstein. China's government should support particularly small and medium-sized enterprises until business returns to normal.\nMore than half of the companies are complaining of a contraction in demand. \"The market stalled,\" said Wollenstein. For example, according to the Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), the car market in China decreased by 20 percent in January compared to the previous month. This is also due to the fact that there were fewer sales days due to the New Year's Eve, said VDA President Hildegard Muller.\nMoreover, according to Wollenstein, due to the interruption of logistics delivery deadlines could not be met (47 percent). Many companies lack staff (47 per cent). Production is also delayed due to lack of deliveries (45 percent). Due to the uncertainties, business or investment decisions were difficult to make (44 percent).\nIf the trade war between the US and China was already a \"wake-up call\" to reduce dependencies, the viral crisis from the perspective of EU Chamber President Wuttke underlines the need to \"diversify supply chainsYeah. This could happen in other countries in Asia, but also within China. In view of the enormous size of the second largest economy, Wuttke stressed: \"Leaving China is not an option.\" For example, a million-dollar city like Shenzhen in South China has a similar economic performance to Israel. \"There is no second China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "\"Just stay calm, it'll go away\"--little is more dangerous in the US at the moment than Donald Trump would think. It may be helpful, given the clumsiness surrounding toilet paper in supermarkets, the theft of respiratory masks and other hysterical reactions to the worldwide spread of the Coronavirus, if a president tries to calm the population. Trump's repeated assertions that no one has to worry, but have a different quality. They lead to lightness, while great caution is long overdue. You're imagining security where there aren't any. They put people and markets at additional risk, as if everything was not bad enough already.\nWhat the country expects is quickly described, because it is likely to happen everywhere. The CDC health authority warns: many will become infected, of which 15 to 20 percent will be seriously ill, there will be many more deaths, all of which can no longer be prevented. Or better yet, it was never completely preventable. Which is why Trump's first reaction to the Corona outbreak was absolutely right: strict entry restrictions. Their main aim was to delay the arrival of the pandemic and thus buy time.\nBut Trump didn't use that time. Perhaps even because he himself believes what he says in the microphone that this virus is \"not such a big deal\" and has done all that is necessary, that the crisis is only written by his opponents so that the economy breaks in to harm him. There are even reports that the President fears journalists might try to pin it on him. Nevertheless, he continues to shake every hand held to him. And he wants to continue to be cheered on in the campaigns of thousandYeah.\nTrump's focus is quite clear, despite all the setbacks: he has realised t hat the Corona crisis is threatening his re-election and he is fighting it with the means at his disposal. He cannot be the President who is trusted by the people in this crisis, who overcomes the political divide with leadership, because it is bigger these days. Trump does not even realize what an opportunity he is missing: think of the pictures of politicians in rubber boots who give the rulers in flood areas during election years, if he had made this crisis his priority early on, it would certainly not have harmed him.\nInstead, Trump acts as autocrats do: questioning the facts, arguing with questionable figures, withholding information, attacking the media, announcing bad news, attempting to suppress expert judgements and expose his own fabrications as truth.\nJust a few examples: the White House, according to the AP news agency, prevented health experts from warning older and thus particularly vulnerable citizens of air travel, probably in order to avoid further burdening the industry. An annual intelligence assessment of the global threat situation for the US, which was already on the agenda in Congress, was cancelled: the Time Magazine reports that the report would warn that the US is still not well prepared for a global pandemic, as it was in the years before. Trump's unsustainable claim: he is also available to anyone who needs a test for the virus, which is still not true after initial problems. And the admission that \"I like the numbers as they are right now\"--the President obviously has no interest in testing as much as possible and documenting the spread; more cases would mean that there might be cause for concerYeah.\nTrump seems to think he can control what happens if he taps a few words and delivers the right images accusing Democrats and their voters, repeatedly calling Fake News and conspiracy, which has often worked. Otherwise, among other things, the procedure for revoking the office of President would have been different. But to contain Corona, it is not enough for the Republicans to participate and applaud the base. And even if Trump, in addition to all the contradictory and bizarre appearances, causes one or other of these reasonable actions: he basically fights against himself and can only lose.\nFor far too many Americans will follow his example and not stick to the facts, they will distrust any serious reporting and the warnings of health experts, and therefore make bad decisions, i.e. increase the rate of infection. Or they can see through it and see the country slip into the crisis because this President has not been able to withstand the virus, which is already causing panic in the economy, at least. Trump plays down the Corona risk and wants to present the image of a perfect crisis manager because he wants to reassure the markets in particular. But he who buys it from him makes a grave mistake.\nMany Americans are under a lot of pressure to drag themselves to work sick anyway. As long as the state does not intervene drastically, hardly anyone will stay at home voluntarily who is not fortunate enough to be able to move easily to the home office. Far too few people have been tested to know how widespread the virus is already in the US. Slowly, the authorities are getting to grips with the bottlenecks, so they will get an overview that other countries already have. All this suggests that the case numbers will rise very sooYeah.\nRight now, therefore, he has one last chance to get the situation under control. Once hospitals can no longer cope with the influx of patients, argue with companies and many lose their jobs or cannot afford a doctor's visit anyway, It is too late. It will not be done with the tax relief and financial aid that has been envisaged so far for some sectors and employees, even vaguely indicated by Trump. But it seems the President is still waiting for the right moment, which he has long missed. And with him awaits those who give him too much faith and do not worry. That makes hysterical hamster races almost reasonable.\nAt the end of 2019, China reported to the World Health Organisation, WHO, the incidence of pneumonia of unclear cause from Wuhan. A week later, researchers identified a novel virus as the cause: they called it 2019-nCov. It belongs to the group of Coronavires. It is now known as Sars-CoV-2 (CoV stands for Coronavirus, Sars for respiratory disease caused by a similar pathogen).\nSars-CoV-2 may have spread from a food market in Wuhan. It also sold exotic animals such as reptiles. The lung disease that the new virus can cause is now called Covid-19 (English for Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease). The disease is called zoonosis, a disease caused by an animal pathogen. Parts of the viral effluent of Sars-CoV-2 are the same pathogens that infect bats. The new virus may have been transmitted to humans via an unknown intermediary.\nBoth the respiratory diseases Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome) are caused by coronary viruses that originate in animals. During the Sars pandemic, in the years 2002 and 2003 about 8.000 people more than 750 died. The Mers virus has infected people from its discovery 2012 to the end of 2019 about 2.500, and every third party has died from it.\nOverall, there are several hundred types of coronavirus. Many of them affect the airways and can cause colds.\nMedical practitioners assume that the virus is transmitted from person to person mainly by drip infection.\nThe WHO recommends general hygiene rules: wash your hands frequently and avoid close contact with people with respiratory diseases and wild animals.\nMore than 200.000 cases of Corona worldwide (stand 18. In addition, there is a high dark number, which researchers suspect roughly somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of all cases. Several thousand people have died as a result of this worldwide. In most cases, however, the infection is very mild. Among the victims of death are, in particular, people with serious illnesses and elderly people.\nFollow the progress of registered cases in Germany on this map.\nThe number of infected worldwide tested positive for Corona shows this map from Johns Hopkins University.\nThere's no way to say for sure yet. The WHO shared on 28th. In January, approximately one fifth of those reported as infected become seriously ill by the virus, so in case of doubt intensive medical treatment is required. Meanwhile, the WHO is treating the disease as a pandemic. Various states have imposed entry and exit restrictions to slow down the spread.\nTypical signs of infection are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Countries around the world have reported cases of infection, including Germany. Researchers are currently working on therapies and vaccinationYeah. Initial clinical studies with vaccines have begun, i. e. few patients are given a test vaccination",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Moscow, 19 - Russia News Agency, alfia yeknieva. Due to the popularity of covid-19, Moscow has taken restrictive measures: from Monday, students will study remotely and many adults will be transferred to remote jobs. How do we find a new coronavirus, how to treat it, why we need a simple quarantine, Russian News Agency reporter listened to the introduction of the consultant of the scientific work of the central Epidemiology Research Institute of the Russian Federal Health Supervision Bureau and the chief expert of the No. 2 infectious clinical hospital. Academician Victor maleev.\n-According to the latest information, 199 people in Russia have been infected with the new Colorado virus. Why quarantine if the official number of patients is small?\n-There are no more patients. We are not fully quarantined. This is a restrictive measure. If the number of new cases increases, measures must be strengthened. It is not allowed to go out of the house and produce. Everything will freeze. Therefore, efforts are being made to ensure that this does not happen.\nUnfortunately, the incidence is rising. Just a few days ago, we added three or four new patients, yesterday it was 30. Now, we're talking about it, but it could double in the morning. So we have to advance. There could be a fatal result soonAbout\n-The operating room just announced that the 79 year old woman died\nI saw her yesterday. She was complicated by a chronic illness. By the way, this patient is a good example of why isolation and isolation are needed. I mean, she didn't say she was abroad. Apparently, she has connections at home with people from Goa, India. Someone came to visit her - one was not quarantined in time. Unfortunately, this is already a local shift. The second mistake: she left too late. She should be sent to our infection hospital right away. She went to a clinic, and then in the second, and then she came to us.\nWe diagnosed covid-19 and started treatment, but the patient already had complications of chronic diseases. -- reported at the headquarters of disease control this afternoon, The patient died of a large number of bilateral thrombi and pulmonary arteries. - about. Red\n-How to treat covid-19 in Moscow hospital?\nWe use special antiviral drugs. There are instructions on how to treat specific coronaviruses. However, these data are provisional because they are regularly revised based on new infection data. We don't have much experience, including China's. Now I have the seventh version of the Chinese method that they usAbout\nWe also used some drugs that proved effective in the treatment of SARS, because these viruses are 90%. We must give the patients comprehensive intensive drugs. Therefore, if people with many related chronic diseases, such as heart disease, become ill, the heart will be strengthened so that the body can control the infection.\nYou mentioned SARS caused by SARS virus. Its full name is SARS CoV, and the new Colorado State is SARS cov-2. Can we say that this is the same thing in two versions?\n- No. This is a brand new virus. This is 90% of SARS CoV homology, which leads to SARS, but it is quite different. At least no new virus was found in the diagnosis of SARS. Some sars-cov-2 looks like mers, like SARS.\nCould a new coronavirus be artificial?\n- No. In order to produce a new virus, its prototype should not be just a variation)（ In other words, the difference between the RNA of a new virus and its predecessor must be considerable, and there must be many differences. It's impossible. Only nature can do this. We haven't fully studied its full capabilities: why it produces new viruses, where it hides themAbout As we all know, infections are cyclical: they happen, then disappear, and then reappear in a while. It's a time to return, and it's hard to predict if it's not a seasonal infection.\nFor example, SARS was discovered in 2002 at about the same time as the new Colorado virus: November. By the summer of 2003, he was gone. Since then, they have been looking for, they want to find a sick person, but not infected. Why? No one can understand. There are samples of SARS CoV virus isolated from patients and stored in a special laboratory without infection.\n-Will the new coronavirus disappear like SARS?\n-Who knows? This is unpredictable. It's like we can't predict if it's going to be seasonal. You know we're still in the same season for the time being. We should see what will happen next year, and then we can come to a conclusion. We didn't even know he would be in a while.\n-Information can be found on the Internet（ The average temperature there is about the same every year. Is that so?\n-No, because the countries that have found new diseases are in different parallel positions. For example, the situation in Chile and Italy is deteriorating, but they are not exactly the sameAbout\n-May we have a similar situation in Colorado virus in Italy?\nShe won't happen again. We must do everything possible to avoid that in the future. That's why preventive restrictions are being implemented in Moscow. Unfortunately, people are not always able to assess the level of the threat. So, at some point, the government has to take tough action. Then, of course, it can be criticized, although, in my opinion, it is praiseworthy. In any case, Russia - one of the few countries that has succeeded in borders with China over the years - is not letting new infections in.\nYou know, people often ask me: why do we have so few infected people? If China is nearby. My answer: the density of residents in China's border areas is lower than that in Russia and Europe. The main patient is still in Moscow. In the Far East and Siberia, there are no such big cities. There is no such thing as Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. All the patients found in various regions - such as Nizhny Novgorod, Akim - returned from abroad and passed through Moscow.\n-How fast is the coroner?\nFour to eight hoursAbout\nSo now patients' biological samples are not sent to virus and Biotechnology Center vector \"Novosibirsk\"?\n-Now we have Colorado virus test systems everywhere. The analysis was carried out in Moscow before, but because it was the first time, they were considered suspicious, so the samples were sent to Novosibirsk for inspection. Now we only send suspicious results.\nDoes the covid-19 test require a hard filter? Now there have been complaints that doctors have refused to carry out such tests.\nThis makes sense because covid-19 is a medical procedure. Let's say there's no evidence for the X-rays and MRI that everyone wants to do - we don't have enough doctors or equipment. Most people don't need these studies. This is a similar situation. They were afraid and asked to do tests.\nThere's only one coroner that paramedics have to do. It's a procedure that includes bleeding, mucous membranes of the nose and throat. This needs some protection. If you doubt it, you can always call the hotline and tell them. Someone comes to you, maybe they'll analyze the biomaterials, maybe they won'tAbout\nFirst of all, this analysis enables those who come back from abroad to contact them, even if they have no symptoms of coronavirus infection.\nIn addition, the new coronavirus has a sinister ability: it may appear in the body, it will disappear. What do I mean? For example, if the patient is seriously dry, he swallows a lot of things and breathes something, then the virus may not show up in the test. In the test, it already exists. Therefore, the analysis must be modified several times.\n-Excuse me, as an infected person, should the person who contacts with the infected person be fined for violating the quarantine?\nYes, of course. What are they doing? Infect others. Now, everyone is afraid of bacterial weapons, but these contacts, in fact, are real bacterial bombs. Because they work with the virus and spread it. Intentional HIV infection is a punishment. This is the same. People bring unhappiness to society, so they have to take responsibility for it. If we do not punish them, they will continue to act and we will not be able to stop the epidemic.\nYou see, it's very difficult to predict the spread of new infections now, because more cases of coronavirus will be brought to Russia 100%. We have 1800 tourists in MontenegroAbout There are Russians in Spain, Italy, some countries in Germany, where the epidemic situation is complex. This is the great potential of infection in our country. At present, we only have 10 cases of local Colorado virus transfer, people contact with foreign people. We all got them. Next, it all depends on people's consciousness, they will come back. If they stay isolated, see a doctor in time, call a hotline, and if other people don't like the Colorado River, we can deal with the epidemic. Now a lot of things depend on you and me",

Molecular biologists in China have found that a new coronavirus that causes the covid-19 pandemic can not only enter human cells through ACE2 receptors, But in other ways - by protein separation of CD147 molecules. The results of the scientists' experiments are published in the biorxiv Electronic Science Library.\n\"We all know that the virus enters the human body with ACE2 receptor. However, because it often appears in heart cells, kidney cells and sexual organs, The fight against the virus through this protein may have a negative impact on these organs. We have isolated receptors that are attacked by another virus molecule, which will expand the library of possible means to contain infection.\nSars-cov-2 virus causes pneumonia in China and other countries, and penetrates human body and other mammalian cells through ACE2 protein molecules, Covering lung cells. Scientists have long found that these larvae play an important role in the life activities of SARS, another dangerous virus, the pathogen of SARS.\nChinese scientists from Xi'an fourth Medical University (Xi'an) and Biotechnology Research Institute (Beijing) found that in order to enter human tissues and cells, covid-19 pathogen is a very likely hallucinogenic agent. Use at least another waAbout This is a CD147 protein receptor.\nScientists discovered the discovery, noting that the SARS virus uses these molecules when it enters human cells and other mammals. In addition, experts have found that these molecules play an important role in controlling other viral infections and malaria. In this spirit, Chinese experts used to inhibit CD147 activity and tried to use sars-cov-2 coronavirus to infect alveolar antibody culture.\nIt turns out that even relatively small concentrations of synthetic antibodies completely prevent the spread of the virus. Later, scientists observed the contaminated cells through an electron microscope, which confirmed that the virus's shell could fuse with CD147. These results show that scientists believe that the drugs developed to protect human beings from malaria and SARS can help prevent and control the sars-cov-2 epidemic.\nRussian federation\nThere are now more than 169000 registered worldwide. It is estimated that in 2001, there were about 6500 new cases of coronavirus infection. Dead, more than 77000 recovered Human beings. Diseases found outside China are in 148 countries, including Russia.\nAt the end of December, a new outbreak of coronavirus (covid-19) broke out in Wuhan, ChinaAbout The World Health Organization recognizes the spread of the disease around the world and calls covid-19 a pandemic.\nThe new type of coronavirus belongs to the same kind of virus as SARS and mers, i.e. SARS and the Middle East mycoplasma. In the past decade, these two viruses have claimed hundreds of lives in the Middle East and East Asia and have repeatedly caused epidemics, Spread through camels and poultry. According to scientists, bats are the original vectors of the 2019 ncov virus, and there is also evidence that this may be guilty.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The spread of covid-19 has reversed the habits of life around the world. Experts cannot say for sure when the epidemic begins to decline, especially when it ends. For the international community as a whole, the main hope remains to provide a Colorado virus vaccine.\nAccording to news reports, American modern biotechnology companies have made progress on this issue. It worked with the National Institutes of health to develop a vaccine prototype called mrna-1273. Human drug trials began in Seattle at the Kaiser Permanent Washington Health Research Institute) in Washington state. In addition, inovio pharmaceuticals is developing its drugs, according to the associated press. Its trials are expected to begin in April in the US, China and South Korea.\nExclusive access\nDespite the success of American experts, the Die Welt newspaper reported earlier this week that, U.S. President Donald Tampa's government has proposed a large \"exclusive license for a possible Colorado virus vaccine from the German company curevac\".\nLast week, Daniel menekela, general manager of curevac, was in the White House with representatives of other pharmaceutical companiesAbout The meeting discussed the issue of Colorado virus vaccines and with irregular organizations, vice president Mike Pence and members of the president's disease control team. As the company's press release points out, meningitis tells U.S. officials that experimental drugs will begin to be ready in the summer.\nAccording to welt, Washington called on cuevac to move its research team to the United States to develop vaccines only for the United States. \" The German Ministry of health confirmed the attempt by the US authorities to take over the company.\nThe news caused outrage among German politicians, who asked Berlin to do everything possible to stop Washington's plans. \"This article is not true,\" U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Greiner wrote on twitter Another US official said the news was \"greatly exaggerated\" and rejected the possibility that any public vaccine could only be used in the US. Curevac itself denies any rumours of absorption.\n\"All efforts are aimed at developing a Colorado virus vaccine to help and protect people and patients around the world.\" It was later learned that the activities of cuevac would be funded by the European CommissioAbout\nGlobal efforts\nAfter Chinese experts were able to isolate the genetic code of the virus, countries around the world began to develop vaccines. Researchers from the European Union, the United States, Australia, Israel, China, Japan and Russia are trying to find a way to fight covid-19. About 35 companies and academic institutions are developing drugs. Four of them have started animal experiments. Recently, clinical research has been allowed in China. It has previously been reported that eight new coronavirus vaccines have been developed in the country, some of which have been successfully tested in transgenic mice and mccack.\nThe search for a vaccine itself is a complex and low-level process. It follows the same principle: scientists try to create something similar, but not as dangerous as pathogens. He then contacts the body's immune system through vaccination. Ideally, the machine remembers an exciter. Under the influence of the new virus, the human body began to react before the infection. However, some experts fear that this balance could be undermined in a rush to vaccinate. This may lead to the deterioration of the disease. According to Reuters, studies have shown that coronavirus drugs have a development risk of so-called antibody dependent infection aggravating syndrome. About This refers to a process in which the disease does not recede after the use of the vaccine, on the contrary, the disease is aggravating.\nIf it is a sudden outbreak, as now, the vaccine problem is more complicated. The virus may appear and disappear in a few months, with rapid changes in transmission. So while watching countries try to find vaccines at the same time, it's more accurately lottery rather than competition. Each team has its own ticket, and whether it will win depends not so much on speed or skill as on the coincidence of success. It's worth remembering that the more teams in the game, the greater the chance of success. From a commercial point of view, the development of vaccines is a dangerous undertaking. It's important to know that only a few candidates can achieve clinical trials.\nVaccination time\nEven if the drug is now available, it will take at least a year and a half of testing before it can be delivered to ordinary consumers. Who says at least 18 months. Once the vaccine is considered effective, mass production is needed. Most organizations trying to win covid-19 don't have the ability at all.\nThese companies intend to support the global innovation alliance to prevent epidemics, CEPIAbout The international organization is ready to invest in vaccine development and increase production at the same time. Recently, she said $2 billion is needed to support drug development. Without that money, the vaccine development program would not be fully implemented, according to Richard Hackett, CEPI's executive director.\nHowever, the obstacles are not over. Another challenge is to provide vaccines to all who need them. In general, the epidemic has the greatest impact on the poorest countries. It's just that they don't have the money to build an effective health care system. This also affects vaccine procurement opportunities. For example, during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the wealthiest countries bought most of their medicines, while the poor countries had nothing. There is another possibility. India, for example, which is a major supplier of vaccines to developing countries, has decided first to use its productive capacity to protect populations under one year of age. Three billion dollars, and then exports drugs to others. This situation can fully explain why the U.S. authorities are willing to get vaccines at all costs.\nIn this regard, who can bring together governments, philanthropic foundations and vaccine manufacturers to agree on a global equitable distribution strategyAbout However, the epidemic is different, in which case no country is obliged to comply with any international regulations. As Jonathan Kwik, a health expert at Duke University in North Carolina, points out, politics and economics are likely to hinder immunization. \"\nWilder Smith, a new infectious disease professor at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine, believes the epidemic is likely to peak and fall to its current level. \"How to get a vaccine.\" In this case, drugs can still save many lives, especially if the virus circulates like flu and there are new seasonal outbreaks.\nBut before vaccine production begins, the disease must be controlled as much as possible. Therefore, as long as scientists work in the laboratory, the rest of the best stay at home and wash their hands.\nDmitry beliaye",

Un reporte del 2003 sobre el coronavirus SARS, por ejemplo, afirma que el coronavirus bovino se conocía desde hace tiempo (  here  ).\nSegún el Centro de Control y Prevención de Enfermedades en los Estados Unidos, (CDC, por sus siglas en inglés) los coronavirus fueron identificados por primera vez a mediado de los años sesenta. “Coronavirus” es un término utilizado para hablar de un grupo de virus y enfermedades. Existen siete tipos diferentes de coronavirus humanos, incluyendo los tipos 229E, NL63, OC43 y HKU1. La mayor parte de los coronavirus humanos causan “enfermedades leves y moderadas en las vías respiratorias altas”, parecidas al resfriado común (here). En diferentes especies, los coronavirus pueden producir un “espectro amplio de síndromes y enfermedades” (  here  ). El CDC menciona que: “A veces los coronavirus que afectan a los animales pueden evolucionar, enfermar a los humanos, y convertirse en nuevos coronavirus. Tres ejemplos recientes de este fenómeno son los 2019-nCOV, SARS-CoV, y MERS CoV.”\nLa nueva cepa del coronavirus humano se llama SARS-CoV-2, (here). Esta última cepa causa la enfermedad llamada COVID-19, el nombre es explicado here SARS-CoV-2 fue identificado después de una investigación sobre el brote a finales del año pasado en Wuhan, China. Actualmente no existe algún tratamiento antiviral para combatir la enfermedad, según el CDC (  here  ).

The post claims that 17 states, as well as the District of Columbia, are in a state of emergency: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Washington. The map also has 15 \"COVID-19 camps\" marked in Seattle, Washington; Fairfield, Riverside and San Diego, California; Fort Carson, Colorado; Omaha, Nebraska; Honolulu, Hawaii; Dallas and San Antonio, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Newark, New Jersey, New York, New York, Detroit, Michigan; and the District of Columbia. The information in this post is partly false. ​\nAs of March 11, 2020, 20 states and the District of Columbia are in state of emergency due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Those states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, and Washington (  here  ). On Wednesday, March 11, 2020, Mayor Muriel Bowser declared (  here  ) both a state of emergency and a public health emergency in the District of Columbia.​\nFive states that are currently in a state of emergency - Arizona (  here  ), Illinois (  here  ), ​\nIowa (  here  ), Louisiana (  here  ), and ​\nMichigan (  here  ) - are not designated as such on this map.​ It may be that this map was designed prior to these states declaring emergencies.\nHowever, three states who have not, as of March 13, 2020 declared an emergency - Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island – are incorrectly marked on the map. (The latest updates on COVID-19 in Ohio can be found  here  . Updates for Pennsylvania can be found  here  and updates for Rhode Island can be found   here  .)​\nThe map’s designation of “COVID-19 camps,” likely a reference to sites of quarantine, is inaccurate in parts. ​While some of these cities have been used for quarantines, others have not, as of March 12, 2020.\nCALIFORNIA – true\nThe marker on Fairfield, California may refer to Travis Air Force Base, where, as   here  , passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship (  here  ), were quarantined.\nThe marker on Riverside, California may refer to March Air Reserve Base, where 195 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China were released from quarantine on February 11, 2020 (  here  ).\nThe marker on San Diego, Calif., may refer to ​Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, where hundreds of passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship (not to be confused with the Diamond Princess cruise ship) are being quarantined (  here  ​).\nCOLORADO – partly false\nThe marker in central Colorado is on Fort Carson, approved for possible use by Defense Secretary Mark Esper in early February (  here  ). As of March 12, 2020, there was no evidence of the site having been needed as a coronavirus quarantine site.\nGEORGIA – true\nThe marker on Atlanta may refer to Dobbins Air Reserve Base in nearby Marietta, Ga. As reported (  here  ) by the Atlanta Journal Constitution, quarantined passengers from the Grand Princess began arriving at the base on March 11, 2020.\nHAWAII – partly false\nThe marker on Honolulu may refer to a CDC quarantine station located there (  here  ). As of March 12, 2020, there are no reports of it being used to quarantine coronavirus patients.\nILLINOIS – partly false\nThe marker on Chicago may refer to Great Lakes Training Center Navy Base near Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The base is one of the military installations near 11 major airports identified by the Pentagon as a potential quarantine site, but has not yet been used as one (  here  ).\nMICHIGAN – partly false\nThe marker on Detroit may refer to Fort Custer Training Center, another potential quarantine site chosen by the Pentagon, near Detroit Metropolitan Airport (  here  ). The training center has not yet been used as a coronavirus quarantine site.\nNEBRASKA – true\nThe marker on Omaha may refer to the University of Nebraska Medical Center, where 13 evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were treated in February 2020, according to NPR (  here  ). The University of Nebraska Medical Center is not designated a potential quarantine site.\nNEW JERSEY – partly false\nThe marker on Newark may refer to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s general quarantine station (  here  ) or the Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, another military installation identified by the Pentagon as a potential coronavirus quarantine site, near Newark Liberty International Airport (  here  ). Neither of these places have yet been used to quarantine people infected with coronavirus.\nNEW YORK – true\nThe marker on New York City may refer to New Rochelle, a suburb 25 miles north of the city that became a local epicenter of the virus. Now designated a “containment area,” Governor Andrew Cuomo, according to Reuters (  here  ), announced on March 10, 2020 that he was calling in the National Guard to help clean public spaces and to deliver food to residents.\nTEXAS – partly false\nIn addition to the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station, Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas is also a quarantine site for passengers from the Grand Princess (  here  ), and was a site of the now lifted quarantine of passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship (  here  ).\nThe marker on Dallas, Texas may refer to the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. This base was among the military installations near 11 major airports identified by the Pentagon, at the request of the Department of Health and Human Services, for coronavirus quarantine for Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China in early February 2020 (  here  ). However, those with potential exposure to the virus did not end up quarantined there.\nWASHINGTON – true\nThe marker on Seattle may refer to Naval Base Kitsap, another military installation identified by the Pentagon for potential coronavirus quarantine (  here  ). The site of the first known U.S. coronavirus on January 21, 2020 (  here  ), Washington State has the highest number of cases in the country, with New York not far behind (  here  ). Naval Base Kitsap has not yet been used as a coronavirus quarantine site, but people have been quarantined in Washington given the elevated number of cases.\nTHE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA – partly false\nThough Mayor ​Bowser declared (  here  ) both a state of emergency and a public health emergency in the nation’s capital, residents of Washington, D.C. have so far only been asked to self-quarantine (  here  ). There is not yet a designated quarantine or containment zone in the District of Columbia as of March 12, 2020.\nPartly false: This map does not accurately show states that have declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak of coronavirus. It is unclear what “COVID-19 camps” are, but Reuters determined that if referring to quarantine facilities, these markers ranged from true to partly false. Several locations had quarantine facilities in place, but they had not been used as accommodation for people requiring isolation due to COVID-19 exposure.\nThis article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

Beijing is exhorting industries to reopen, but the virus, which has now spread around the globe, continues to threaten China’s economy and the health of its people.\nMainland China has not seen any new locally transmitted coronavirus cases in six of the past eight days, shifting the focus to preventing infected people arriving from overseas from triggering a fresh outbreak in the country. All 67 new cases reported by the end of Wednesday were imported, as were all 47 reported the previous day, the National Health Commission said earlier on Thursday, putting the total number of confirmed cases to date at 81,285.\nThe commission reported a total of 3,287 deaths by the end of Wednesday, up six from the previous day.\nHubei, home to some 60 million people, reported no new cases on Wednesday and opened its borders.\nThe lockdown of Hubei’s capital Wuhan, where the virus first appeared late last year, will be lifted on April 8, a milestone in China’s war against the epidemic.\nAbout 90% of all the imported cases are Chinese passport holders, Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui told a press conference, adding that 40% of those were overseas Chinese students returning amid rising infections abroad.\n“We understand some overseas students are eager to come home...But under the current circumstances, by staying put, they can avoid being cross-infected in the hurried journey home or getting stuck mid-journey when the countries they transit in tighten border controls,” Luo said.\nShanghai will make every international traveler arriving from 6 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) on Thursday go into quarantine for 14 days, the local government announced.\nIt had previously only required this for travelers who had visited any of 24 badly-hit countries in the previous two weeks.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "XIANNING, China (Reuters) - Residents of China’s Xianning city eager to travel after a two-month lockdown faced an unexpected hurdle only hours after the borders were opened — they needed to pass a new rapid detection test to show they didn’t have the coronavirus.\nDozens rushed to the city’s largest hospital but were told the hospital was no longer doing the nucleic acid tests and were advised to try hospitals in nearby villages or towns.\nThe test uses genetic material from throat swabs and normally takes a few hours for a result.\n“If we can’t get the nucleic acid test how can we leave? I can’t get on the train, I’ve bought my ticket but I can’t leave,” Shen Jianning, 51, said on Thursday morning.\nShen, who wants to return to his job on a metro construction project in Shanghai, rushed to Xianning Central Hospital at around 4 a.m. on Thursday in hopes of getting a nucleic acid test, but was told by doctors there that they no longer were doing the tests and he had to find an alternative.\nSigns pasted on glass doors of the hospital, the city’s largest, said people should go to village or town hospitals to get the tests done.\nXianning announced the test requirement on its official WeChat account on Wednesday, the day Hubei province, epicenter of China’s coronavirus outbreak and home to 60 million people, removed much of its lockdown transport measures.\nThe lifting of the Hubei lockdown is a major milestone in the fight against the coronavirus in China. More than 80% of COVID-19 cases and 96% of deaths in mainland China have been in Hubei.\nThe provincial capital Wuhan, where the virus first appeared late last year and which has had 54% of cases, remains under lockdown until April 8.\nThe order to use the rapid-detection test came after news that a man who had traveled from the city last week had later tested positive when he returned to work in Guangdong province.\nThe lifting of the lockdown has been accompanied by both relief and worry, with several people in Xianning telling Reuters they were unnerved by the case of the man who had traveled to Guangdong.\n“My Shanghai boss has called me a few times asking me to get out as soon as possible. He even prepared the proof of work resumption for me. He told me what processes you need to do we will help you, just think of a way to get out,” Shen said.\nShen, from the eastern province of Jiangsu, had been trapped in Xianning after traveling to the city to see a house he had bought there.\nMillions of people were caught in Hubei or stuck outside it as China imposed draconian measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, an approach that has proven effective, with reported new domestically transmitted cases falling to zero on most recent days, even as imported cases persist.\nOn Thursday morning, about 30 people queued outside Xianning Central Hospital, all of them required to complete a form declaring whether they had recently come back from overseas or been in any high risk areas.\nSome in the queue said they were lining up for a nucleic test, but were unclear where they could get it done. A number were trying to get back to Guangdong province to work.\n“I saw on Douyin that a few hundred people came here yesterday, there were lots of people,” said He Ting, referring to the Chinese version of TikTok.\nShe has been stuck in Xianning since Lunar New Year in January and was trying to get back to her job in the southwestern city of Chengdu, in Sichuan province, and was also unable to get the test at the hospital\n“I’m trying to figure out another way,” she said.\nAt the Xianning Yongan Health Service Centre, a community health center, more than a hundred people milled in and outside its gates. A long queue snaked with people clutching paper slips with numbers on them. Some said they were told that results would take a day or two.\n“I came here to queue but they told me I needed to register and then wait for a call on when it’s my turn,” said a man as he got on his electric scooter to leave.\n“I need to get back to my job in Dongguan. But now I don’t know when I can leave.”\n",

The future of this pandemic to a greater extent will be determined by what happens with very large, densely populated countries,” Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies program, said.\n“So it’s really, really important that India continues to take aggressive action at the public health level and at the level of society to contain, control and suppress this disease.”\nThe Indian government said essential services including groceries, fuel stations and banks will remain open. The stock market, located in the financial capital Mumbai, will also operate on Wednesday.\nBut ahead of the shutdown starting midnight, people in Delhi and Mumbai were rushing to shops to stock up essentials and in some areas police were deployed to main order.\nModi said the government was working to reduce the difficulties for the poor who will be the hardest hit by the shuttering down of Asia’s third largest economy. But he did not provide any details.\nHe urged people not to crowd around shops and said there was enough stocks.\n“It is a decisive decision - a difficult one, but probably the right one,” said Partha Chatterjee, professor of economics at Shiv Nadar University near New Delhi.\n“The first priority is to save lives and then think of reconstruction.”\nAcross South Asia, home to a quarter of the world’s population, authorities are scrambling to raise their defenses as the virus spreads.\nFour NATO service members in Afghanistan tested positive for coronavirus shortly after entering the country, the first confirmed cases in the mission, NATO said in a statement.\n“The service members were newly arrived in country, and were in a precautionary screening facility when they became symptomatic, were moved to isolation and were tested,” the statement said.\nAround 1,500 NATO service members, most of whom had recently arrived in Afghanistan, were in screening facilities as a precautionary measure, NATO said.\nAfghanistan’s health ministry said that WHO had estimated that 80 percent of the war ravaged country’s 32 million population could be infected with the virus in the next five months. So far it has had 74 cases and one death.\nInvoking a 56-year-old law, Nepal also ordered a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus after reporting a second case in the Himalayan nation of 30 million people.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nI must say so far, it has been a success. That is because we started acting right from the beginning when the first three cases were identified in Kerala. Our response was very good.\nIt was not like we started our efforts groping in the dark. We did everything systematically and in a structured manner trying to find the local clusters where the infected people might have accidentally gone.\nNo, I am talking about India. The Government of India brought the stranded people from Wuhan in China, and then quarantined them.\nWe had all the information about the number of Indians in China, how many of them were coming and how many were staying back.\nIt was not like fighting an unknown enemy. We knew what we were doing. I would say it was a very structured and systematic effort that took place.\nHere in Kerala, we had only a handful of infected people. But we were confident that nobody else in India would get the infection from anybody who came back from China.\nYou should see this as the most important positive point. Not a single person in India got infected from anybody during the China epidemic.\nIt changed only when the epidemic reached Europe.\nIn the China epidemic, the numbers were limited. And we exactly knew how many people were coming to India from China. And we had fixed points of entry.\nAnother most important thing was, most of those coming from China were youngsters who were otherwise healthy.\nAlso, those who were coming from China came as single individuals as most of them were students there. They did not come as family. So, it was easy to isolate them and contain the virus. We had no difficulty in keeping them away from their families for long periods too.\nThis was what happened during the Wuhan episode.\nThe situation is totally different with the epidemic in Europe and the Middle East.\nThere are two or three reasons for this. First, people are coming from so many areas. It is a convergence of so many routes and landing in so many places in India like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kerala, Bangalore, etc.\nAnd they are getting redistributed among the Indian population.\nYes. Right now, if you look at the number, you will see that 99.9% of the infected people got infected when they were outside India.\nThis time, different strata of family members are affected because unlike those who came from China, those coming from Europe and the US are coming to join the families here. So, the first preference the moment they land at the airport, is go to their families.\nAnd most of the time they are coming to meet the elderly people in their families back home. This is a big challenge for us. Our primary job right now is to prevent them from meeting elderly family members.\nLook at the Ranni incident that happened in Kerala. The family who came here from Italy had a family reunion immediately after they landed. Then, they visited other relatives and also attended some family functions.\nI would say our country is not responsible for what has happened so far. Any control measures you announce in India will have no impact when people come to India carrying the virus. Unless of course, you stop them from coming to India.\nI will tell you how the virus spreads.\nThose coming with the virus will first infect those who are in close contact. That is not a community spread; just cluster spread. Like the family who came to Ranni infected other family members, which is the close cluster of people.\nIf another person or a group of people get infected from someone in this cluster, and then infects somebody else, we will reach a situation where we will not be able to trace the origin.\nThat's when community spread starts. Community spread happens when the cluster spread gets dispersed.\nOur job right now is to prevent the clusters from dispersing.\nIt is possible, that is what Kerala is doing right now.\nFor example, people from Ranni landed here on the 29th of February. Six people got infected from them in the first week of March. Now, we are in the third week of March. So far, not a single person who was in contact with one of these family members, has developed the disease.\nExactly.\nFrom what the prime minister said, it appears that other states are following the same method as this is the only scientific method to prevent community spread.\nWhat we have done is nothing out of the world; just a scientific and systematic approach to the problem.\nNow, the 150-odd people who have come to the country with the virus, are staying in their own homes. If they infect their family members or the infected family members go out and infect somebody else, we may find it difficult to trace them.\nThat's why we are trying to track the route of the maximum number of people and keep them in the net so that we will come to know immediately when somebody develops the symptoms.\nThe only way to prevent the disease from spending is keeping the infected person away from the population. And that's what we are doing right now.\nNo. We do not have enough scientific information on whether environmental temperature has anything to do with this.\nWe see the Gulf countries also getting affected, and we can't say that the temperature is low in those countries. Their winter is over, and now the temperature is high.\nYou can't say that India is not getting affected; India is getting affected. And the time is only catching up with us, and we do not know whether the numbers will go up or not.\nThe difference is, other countries did not behave the way we have done so far.\nIn fact, even though we are telling people not to panic, we are sending panic messages, and this should keep the Indian population away from the infected people. In a way, this shouting out is good.\nToday, except in the metropolitan cities, you don't see anyone outside on the streets. If you go to any place in Kerala right now, you will see that people are not coming out at all.\nFor a disease to affect people, you need three components. One is, the person should have the virus. Second is the transmissible range of the virus. And the third is the number of susceptible people who are coming into contact with the person with the virus.\nThis is the formula; AxBxC. Here A is constant; the number of people who are infected is constant right now. It is increasing only at a slow pace.\nThe transmissible range is fixed as far as the virus is concerned. It is not going to change and it is not changing.\nSo, the determinant of the formula AxBxC is the number of susceptible people who are going to get into contact with the person with the virus. That is where we are right now.\nWhat has happened in many other countries is, for example in Europe or the US, the control of the government on the common man is much, much less than what we have here.\nHere, the common man listens. We have a tendency to listen to or respect authority. We don't question them. This may be one of the good traits that Indians have.\nThis is exactly what helped China though whether you want to listen to authority or not, you are forced to listen there. And the authority was very powerful too. Here the authority is not powerful, but people are ready to listen.\nThere is no doubt about it. We now know how to face the disease.\nIf it had happened here in India first instead of in China, it would have been the end of it!\nYes, we have been fortunate that way.\nBut looking at what is happening in the European countries, the US and the UK, I feel they have not learnt the lessons from the China epidemic.\nAlso, Europe has a porous border. So, it is easy for the virus to spread.\nIf you take India, there are hundreds of villages in India where people don't need to mix with outsiders. While mixing happens very easily in Europe. That could be one of the reasons why it spread so fast throughout Europe.\nThough there is no scientific proof to it, I think because Indians are exposed to so many viruses, we do not know whether immunity against one of those viruses is protecting us from the coronavirus. We do not know. It is a remote responsibility.\nIf the virus can kill somebody, it can survive only for a short time.\nIf the virus does not kill you, it can survive for a longer period.\nAbout SARS, anybody who is infected with SARS lives only for a very small span of time. That was what happened with Nipah, and Ebola where the mortality rate was very high.\nAnd when the mortality rate is so high, the number of people remaining with the virus comes down.\nSimilarly, nobody with HIV virus dies immediately; they live for 10 to 15 years.\nIt means, in such conditions, viruses survive in the human body for longer periods. When that happens, more and more people get infected from them.\nThe problem with coronavirus is that only the elderly is affected. So, if we have a system where the elderly alone is protected, we can prevent deaths and infections a lot.\nThat's why in the guidelines to be followed, the government has asked people above 65 to be quarantined even if they are not infected. This will prevent the vulnerable population from getting exposed to the virus.\nIf nobody dies of the coronavirus, nobody will be bothered about the virus. See, we have the common cold, flu, respiratory viruses and hundreds and thousands of people get infected. But nobody dies of these viruses.\nOur problem is the elderly and people with existing illnesses. So, our target should be to see that these people do not get infected.\nIn the case of HIV, we had a similar situation till ART became available. With HIV treatment available, things are totally different.\nIn the case of covid-19, a majority of people who are suffering from the infection are recovering without any problem.\nWe are not worried about the number of youngsters getting infected with coronavirus because they will have a spontaneous recovery. Their mortality is 1 in 1,000 which is much less than, say, road accidents. More young people die from road accidents than due to coronavirus infection.\nWe are only worried about the young people giving the infection to those around them, and they include the elderly and the diabetics. So, we want to prevent that from happening./p>\nBy now, we know what is going to happen tomorrow. The whole picture is clear to us. That is why India is likely to succeed in this war.\nYes. Unlike European countries, a majority of our population is young. Maybe that's why India has a bigger chance to succeed against covid-19. We cannot say anything with certainly unless we prove it scientifically.\nIndia may not succumb like other countries. At the same time, if we are a little careless, we will run into trouble. No doubt about that.\nYes. If you are not worried, you will not be careful. Like any country in the world has to be worried, India also has to be worried. If you are careless, there will be problems.\nYes, the next two weeks are crucial. Because if we go to the next stage, then it will be a stage of no return. That is what happened to Italy and the whole of Europe.\nWe don't want to go to that stage. Controlling 150 people who came to India is not difficult, but controlling even 50,000 people is very difficult and impossible.\nThat will happen with all epidemics. After some time, the number of susceptible population will come down, that is when a good number of them either die or recover.\nThere is nothing unusual in China not reporting any new cases. It is something we have expected. The earlier you reach that, the more comfortable you are.\nIt is difficult to say. Every epidemic has got a trajectory; it goes up to a significant level and then comes down.\nThe only corollary I can think of is H1N1. It is still there in the community, but the big panic about it is over now.\nWhen people get H1N1, they are not dying in large numbers. Because we know how to handle the situation.\nSo, I feel covid-19 might linger on for many more months at a smaller pace. Or, it can become catastrophic.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "我必须说，到目前为止，这是一个成功。这是因为我们从喀拉拉邦发现前三个病例开始就采取行动。我们的反应很好。\n我们并不是在黑暗中开始摸索的。我们做的每件事都是系统的、有条理的，试图找到感染者可能意外离开的地方。\n不，我说的是印度。印度政府将这些被困人员从中国武汉带来，然后对他们进行隔离。\n我们掌握了所有的信息，包括在中国的印度人的数量，他们中有多少人来了，还有多少人留下来了。\n这不像是在和一个未知的敌人作战。我们知道我们在做什么。我想说，这是一项非常有组织和系统的努力。\n在喀拉拉邦，我们只有少数感染者。但我们相信，在印度，没有人会从任何从中国回来的人身上感染病毒。\n你应该把这看作是最重要的积极点。在中国流行期间，印度没有一个人受到任何人的感染。\n只有当这种流行病蔓延到欧洲时，情况才有所改变。\n在中国的流行病中，数量是有限的。我们完全知道有多少人从中国来印度。我们有固定的入口。\n另一件最重要的事情是，大多数来自中国的年轻人在其他方面都很健康。\n而且，那些来自中国的人都是单身，因为他们大多数都是中国学生。他们不是一家人来的。所以，很容易分离出它们并控制病毒。我们也不难让他们长期远离家人。\n这就是武汉事件中发生的事情。\n这种情况与欧洲和中东的流行病完全不同。\n这有两三个原因。首先，人们来自很多地. 它是印度众多航线的交汇点，在德里、孟买、海得拉巴、钦奈、喀拉拉邦、班加罗尔等地都有降落。\n他们正在印度人口中重新分配。\n对。现在，如果你看看这个数字，你会发现99.9%的感染者在印度以外的地方受到感染。\n这一次，不同阶层的家庭成员受到了影响，因为与来自中国的家庭不同，来自欧洲和美国的家庭成员是来这里加入家庭的。所以，当他们在机场降落时，他们的第一选择是去他们的家人那里。\n而且大部分时间他们都是来接家里的老人。这对我们来说是一个巨大的挑战。我们现在的主要工作是防止他们会见年迈的家庭成员。\n看看发生在喀拉拉邦的兰尼事件。从意大利来到这里的一家人在着陆后立即团聚。然后，他们拜访了其他亲戚，也参加了一些家庭活动。\n我想说，我们的国家对目前所发生的一切不负责任。你在印度宣布的任何控制措施在人们携带病毒来到印度时都不会产生影响。当然，除非你阻止他们来印度。\n我会告诉你病毒是如何传播的。\n携带这种病毒的人首先会感染那些密切接触的人。这不是一个社区传播；只是集群传播。像兰尼一家的其他成员也感染了兰尼，这是一个亲密的人群。\n如果另一个人或一组人从这个群中的某个人感染，然后再感染其他人，我们将达到无法追踪来源的情况。\n那是社区传播开始的时候。当集群扩散扩散时，就会发生集群扩散。\n我们现在的工作是防止集群分散。\n有可能，那就是喀拉拉邦现在所做.\n例如，兰尼的人在2月29日登陆这里。三月份的第一周就有六个人被感染了。现在，我们在三月的第三个星期。到目前为止，没有一个人接触过这些家庭成员中的一人患上这种疾病。\n确切地。\n从总理所说的来看，似乎其他州也在遵循同样的方法，因为这是防止社区蔓延的唯一科学方法。\n我们所做的并不是什么天方夜谭，只是对这个问题的科学和系统的处理。\n现在，带着病毒来到这个国家的150多人，都住在自己家里。如果他们感染了他们的家庭成员或者被感染的家庭成员出去感染了其他人，我们可能会发现很难追踪到他们。\n这就是为什么我们试图追踪最多人数的人的路线，并将他们保持在网络中，以便我们能立即知道何时有人出现症状。\n防止疾病蔓延的唯一方法就是让感染者远离人群。这就是我们现在正在做的。\n不，我们没有足够的科学资料来证明环境温度是否与此有关。\n我们看到海湾国家也受到影响，我们不能说这些国家的气温很低。他们的冬天结束了，现在气温很高。\n你不能说印度没有受到影响；印度正在受到影响。时间只会赶上我们，我们不知道数字会不会上升。\n不同的是，其他国家并没有像我们现在这样做。\n事实上，即使我们告诉人们不要惊慌，我们也在传递恐慌信息，这应该能让印度民众远离感染者。在某种程度上，这种叫喊是好的。\n今天，除了大城市，你在街上看不到任何. 如果你现在去喀拉拉邦的任何一个地方，你会发现人们根本不会出来。\n一种疾病要影响人，你需要三个要素。一是，人应该有病毒。其次是病毒的传播范围。第三是与病毒携带者接触的易感人群的数量。\n这是公式；AxBxC。这里A是恒定的；现在被感染的人数是恒定的。它的增长速度很慢。\n就病毒而言，传播范围是固定的。它不会改变，也不会改变。\n因此，公式AxBxC的决定因素是与病毒携带者接触的易感人群的数量。这就是我们现在的处境。\n在许多其他国家发生的事情，例如在欧洲或美国，政府对普通人的控制比我们这里的要少得多。\n在这里，普通人倾听。我们倾向于倾听或尊重权威。我们不会质疑他们。这可能是印度人的优良品质之一。\n这正是帮助中国的原因。不管你是否想听权威的话，你都不得不听。权威也非常强大。这里的权威并不强大，但人们愿意倾听。\n毫无疑问。我们现在知道如何面对这种疾病。\n如果这件事先发生在印度而不是中国，那就完了！\n是的，我们很幸运。\n但纵观欧洲国家、美国和英国的情况，我觉得它们没有从中国疫情中吸取教训。\n此外，欧洲的边界也有漏洞。所以，病毒很容易传播。\n如果以印度为例，印度有数百个村庄，人们不需要与外来者混在一起。而混合在欧洲很容易发生。这可能是它在欧洲传播如此之快的原因之.\n虽然没有科学证据，但我认为，因为印度人接触了这么多病毒，我们不知道对其中一种病毒的免疫是否能保护我们免受冠状病毒的侵害。我们不知道。这是一个遥远的责任。\n如果病毒能杀死某人，它只能存活很短的时间。\n如果病毒没有杀死你，它可以存活更长的时间。\n关于非典，任何感染非典的人只能活很短的一段时间。尼帕病毒和埃博拉病毒的死亡率都很高。\n当死亡率如此之高时，病毒携带者的数量就会下降。\n同样，艾滋病毒携带者也不会立即死亡；他们能活10到15年。\n这意味着，在这种情况下，病毒在人体内存活的时间更长。当这种情况发生时，越来越多的人受到感染。\n冠状病毒的问题是只有老年人受到影响。因此，如果我们有一个保护老年人的系统，我们可以预防很多死亡和感染。\n这就是为什么在要遵循的指导方针中，政府要求65岁以上的人即使没有感染也要隔离。这将防止易受感染人群接触病毒。\n如果没有人死于冠状病毒，就没有人会为病毒而烦恼。看，我们有常见的感冒，流感，呼吸道病毒和成百上千的人被感染。但是没有人死于这些病毒。\n我们的问题是老年人和有疾病的人。所以，我们的目标应该是确保这些人不会被感染。\n在艾滋病病毒的病例中，我们也有类似的情况，直到抗逆转录病毒疗法出现。有了艾滋病治疗，情况就完全不同了。\n在covid-19的病例中，大多数感染者正在康复，没有任何问.\n我们并不担心会有多少年轻人感染冠状病毒，因为他们会自发康复。他们的死亡率是千分之一，远低于交通事故。死于交通事故的年轻人比死于冠状病毒感染的年轻人多。\n我们只担心年轻人把感染传染给周围的人，他们包括老年人和糖尿病患者。所以，我们希望防止这种情况发生\n现在，我们知道明天会发生什么。我们看得很清楚。这就是为什么印度有可能在这场战争中取得成功。\n对。与欧洲国家不同，我国大多数人口是年轻人。也许这就是为什么印度有更大的机会战胜科维德-19。除非我们科学地证明，否则我们不能肯定地说什么。\n印度可能不会像其他国家一样屈服。同时，如果我们稍有不慎，就会遇到麻烦。毫无疑问。\n对。如果你不担心，你就不会小心。就像世界上任何国家都必须担心一样，印度也必须担心。如果你粗心，就会有问题。\n是的，接下来的两周至关重要。因为如果我们进入下一个阶段，那么这将是一个没有回报的阶段。意大利和整个欧洲就是这样。\n我们不想去那个舞台。控制150名来到印度的人并不困难，但控制甚至5万人都非常困难，不可能。\n所有流行病都会发生这种情况。一段时间后，易感人群的数量就会下降，也就是说，相当一部分人要么死亡，要么康复。\n在中国，没有任何不寻常的事情不报告任何新的案件。这是我们所期待的。你越早到达那里，你就越舒服。\n很难说。每一种流行病都有一个发展轨迹；它会上升到一个显著的水平，然后下降。\n我能想到的唯一推论是H1N. 它仍然存在于社会中，但是关于它的大恐慌现在已经结束了。\n当人们感染H1N1病毒时，他们不会大量死亡。因为我们知道如何处理这种情况。\n所以，我觉得covid-19可能会以较小的速度在更长的时间内停留。或者，它可能成为灾难。现在几乎是不可预测的。\n我们担心是否会出现这种情况。这真是全世界的担忧",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday said Wuhan city had turned the tide against the deadly coronavirus, as he made his first visit to the virus' epicentre in a message that Beijing has the situation under control and vowed to resolutely fight for a victory against the novel COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nWearing a protective mask and accompanied by a retinue of military and health officials, Xi - who initially came under criticism for not acting in time to stem the virus when it first showed up in December last year, but later won praise for a decisive\nfollow-up action - visited a makeshift hospital and community residents and frontline workers in Wuhan.\nXi, 66, vowed to resolutely fight for a victory in the war against the coronavirus during his inspection tour of Wuhan, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\nDuring his visit, Xi said the spread of coronavirus had been basically curbed in Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan where over 50 million people lived in total isolation since January 23 following a complete lockdown of the areas.\nThe initial success has been made in stabilising the situation and turning the tide in Hubei and Wuhan, Xi said.\nAhead of the President's visit on Tuesday, China's National Health Commission announced a dramatic drop in number of COVID-19 cases both of which fell below 20 mark for the first time since the NHC began daily reporting of cases in later part of January.\nThe NHC reported 19 new confirmed cases of infection and 17 fatalities on Monday. All the 17 new deaths were in Hubei province and in Wuhan, while Beijing and other cities geared up for \"imported cases\" with the return of large number of Chinese and foreigners to re-join work.\nThe overall confirmed cases in the Chinese mainland have reached 80,754 by the end of Monday. This included 3,136 people who died of the disease. 17,721 patients are still undergoing treatment while 59,897 patients have been discharged after recovery, the NHC said.\nWhile the virus has abated in China, it has spread to over 100 countries. The death toll has reached 4,011 globally with more than 110,000 cases of infection.\nThis is the second visit to Wuhan by a top Chinese leader.\nChinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan on January 26 when the COVID-19 virus spread at an alarming pace, prompting a lockdown of the city and the Central Hubei province with 50 million people.\nXi, also general secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and head of the military, called for firm, solid and meticulous prevention and control efforts to defend Hubei and Wuhan.\nThe coronavirus has become a major challenge to Xi's leadership who is often referred to as China's most powerful leader after the CPC founder Mao Zedong, with the prospect of life-long tenure in power.\nAfter over three-month long battle against the virus, China has come to a grinding halt with estimated losses of over USD 103 billion.\nThe virus has also caused acute distress among people as China locked down the Hubei province while implemented stringent measures all over the country including closure of factories and offices to contain the virus.\nXi said after hard work, the situation in Hubei and Wuhan had shown positive changes with important progress, but the prevention and control task remain arduous.\nHe praised the sacrifices of people of Wuhan and Hubei province.\nThe positive trend in preventing and controlling the virus could not have been achieved without the sacrifice, devotion, perseverance and hard efforts of the people of Wuhan, Xi said.\nWith their concrete actions, Wuhan people have demonstrated the strength and spirit of China, as well as the Chinese people's love for the family and the nation, which enables them to stick together through thick and thin, he said.\nAfter his arrival in Wuhan, Xi went straight to Huoshenshan Hospital, the 1000-bed makeshift hospital built in record time of less than 10 days to inspect thousands of cases.\nChina also built another 1300-bed hospital equally in record time, rushed over 30,000 medical staff from the military as well as from all over to treat the spiralling number of cases.\nThe official media reported with the cases falling in big numbers, all the makeshift hospitals numbering over 14 are now being dismantled in Wuhan.\nAt the hospital, Xi greeted medical staff through television monitor and learned about community-based efforts for epidemic prevention and control, Xinhua reported.\nHe also visited residents of a community in Wuhan who are subject to self-quarantine, looking into the community-level prevention and control work as well as daily necessity supply.\nXi's visit sent a strong signal to the entire country and the world that China is ascending out of the darkest moment amid the outbreak, and the battle against the epidemic has now entered the next stage, state-run Global Times quoted analysts assaying.\nXi's Wuhan visit at this moment shows the turning point of China's domestic fight against the epidemic has arrived and now the fight is shifting its focus to prevent imported cases of infection and gradually resume economic activities and production, analysts said.\nLu Keli, an associate professor at the school of Marxism studies in the Renmin University of China in Beijing told the Global Times that Xi's visit showed that China had achieved a phased victory at the current juncture that can help effectively stabilise and control the epidemic situation.\n",

NHC表示，17721名患者仍在接受治疗，59897名患者康复后出院。\n虽然病毒在中国已经减弱，但它已经传播到100多个国家。全球死亡人数已达4011人，感染病例超过11万例。\n这是中国最高领导人第二次访问武汉。\n中国总理李克强1月26日访问武汉，当时COVID-19病毒以惊人的速度传播，导致武汉和湖北省中部地区5000万人被封锁。\n作为执政党中国共产党总书记、军队总司令的习近平，要求坚决、扎实、细致地防控湖北、武汉。\n冠状病毒已经成为习近平领导层面临的一大挑战，他经常被称为继中共创始人毛泽东之后中国最有权力的领导人，有望终身执政。\n经过三个多月的抗病毒斗争，中国已进入一个艰难的停顿期，估计损失超过1030亿美元。\n随着中国封锁湖北省，同时在全国范围内实施包括关闭工厂和办公室在内的严格措施来控制病毒，该病毒也在人们中造成了严重的困扰。\n习近平说，经过艰苦努力，湖北、武汉形势出现积极变化，取得重要进展，但防控任务依然艰巨。\n他赞扬了武汉和湖北人民的牺牲。\n习近平说，没有武汉人民的牺牲、奉献、毅力和艰苦努力，就不可能实现预防和控制病毒的积极趋势。\n他说，武汉人民用自己的实际行动，展示了中国的力量和精神，也展示了中国人民对家庭和民族的热爱，使他们能够同舟共.\n习近平抵达武汉后，直接前往霍山医院，这家1000张床位的临时医院在不到10天的创纪录时间内建成，检查了数千例病例。\n中国还在创纪录的时间内平均新建了1300个床位的医院，从军队和各地紧急赶来了3万多名医务人员，以治疗不断增加的病例。\n据官方媒体报道，随着这些病例的大量减少，武汉市所有14家以上的临时医院都在拆除。\n据新华社报道，在医院，习近平通过电视监视器向医务人员致意，了解了社区防疫工作情况。\n他还走访了武汉市某社区实行自我隔离的居民，了解社区一级的防控工作和日常生活必需品供应情况。\n官方媒体《环球时报》引述分析人士分析说，习近平的访问向全国和世界发出了一个强烈信号，即中国正在走出疫情最黑暗的时刻，抗击疫情的斗争现在已经进入下一阶段。\n分析人士说，习近平此刻的武汉之行表明，中国国内防治艾滋病的转折点已经到来，现在的斗争重心正在转移，以预防输入性感染病例，逐步恢复经济活动和生产。\n北京中国人民大学马克思主义学院副教授陆克力对《环球时报》表示，习近平的访问表明，中国在当前关头取得了阶段性胜利，有助于有效稳定和控制疫情",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nPeople the world over are anxious and scared because of the coronavirus outbreak, and Indians are no exception\nThere are three ways of looking at how a person responds to a situation like this. One is on an individual basis. The second is on the community level, and the third is on the health system.\nAll these three factors interact together and work on a person to behave in a certain way.\nEven people who are absolutely normal, when faced with something like this over which you have no control and which disrupts your lifecycle, daily routine and social life completely, can become depressed and anxious.\nWe have the evidence that during the initial outbreak in Wuhan in China, more than 50 per cent of the population suffered from depression and one-third of them had moderate to severe anxiety; anxieties about themselves and their families.\nThere was generally an increased level of anxiety.\nIt is mostly the uncertainty of the whole situation. The disease is pandemic, and the virus is spreading fast. So far there is no treatment available.\nSo, when you do not know much about the virus which spreads really fast, and you do not have a vaccine, the general anxiety level of the population increases tremendously.\nIn such a situation, people who are vulnerable psychologically are more likely to be upset.\nIt is normal. Even normally healthy people who are not exposed to covid-19 become worried and anxious when they develop a cold and cough. This can be distressing.\nWhen I said those who are vulnerable, I meant those who are already depressed or anxious, and it aggravates.\nFor example, these people may wash their hands continuously.\nIn the case of this virus, the really vulnerable are the old people above the age of 70. The epidemiological studies have shown that the virus seems to cause mortality in older people with prevailing health conditions like hypertension and diabetes.\nMany elderly people are on ACE inhibitors (medicine to control hypertension) and if they contract the virus, they are more likely to have problems.\nWhen you are older, the tendency to be anxious and depressed is more, and it will be even more in situations like these where you have no control.\nChildren who do not know much about the virus also can get anxious because of the situation they are forced into and also by picking up news from here and there.\nThey also see their parents being anxious which makes them behave in such a way that parents will find it difficult to control them.\nIt can make or break the family.\nThey can develop more bonding as they can't go out and are forced to interact with each other. In a fairly stable family, it can foster bonding and they may enjoy the togetherness.\nBut if the family is already wobbly and discordant, when they lose the space which they use to have is gone, there may be more flare-ups. This can be more damaging.\nSo, it entirely depends on the family's pre-existing situation.\nYes, we have similar kind of statistics from all epidemics that the anxiety level, depressive level and worries of people goes up.\nNo. That was different because in the case of HIV, the spread happened only when people were in contact. So, people were more relaxed about the HIV virus. They knew that only if they had physical contact would they contract the virus. So, HIV did not create this kind of anxiety.\nBut covid-19 is not a contact virus; it is a droplet virus.\nEven if you have not met a person who has covid-19, if you touch the glass he has used or the railing or the lift button he has touched, and then you touch your eyes, nose or mouth, you get the virus.\nIt means you do not know from where you are getting the virus.\nWhen the environment itself causes danger, there will be more anxiety.\nI think so. This is a pandemic. HIV was an epidemic. So also Ebola, and they were able to contain it fast. We were able to come out with a vaccine for SAARS and H1N1 quickly.\nNo other virus has reached the scale in which this is in. What is worrying about covid-19 is the rapidity of its spread.\nIf you look at the RO number, that is how many people each infected person infects, it is the highest in the case of covid-19.\nThe RO number for SAARS was 2 while it is 6 in the case of covid-19. It means each covid-19 infected person is capable of infecting six other people.\nI won't say this is the deadliest virus.\nYes, it spreads very fast, but if you look at the mortality rate, it is only 2% to 3% of the people who contract it. But it is highly contagious.\nI would say, you should face it calmly.\nThe more anxious you are, the more stressed you are, your immunity level comes down, and you are likely to pick up the virus.\nYou should follow precautions, but you should not panic.\nSocial isolation itself can create panic among people. So, stay connected. Unlike 20, 30 years ago, today you can stay connected with people.\nI also would say the biggest creator of anxiety and panic is social media because the kind of fake news that gets circulated. That's why WHO said, please avoid listening to fake news.\nListen only to accurate and not falsified numbers, figures, localities, etc put out by the government.\nDefinitely. Anything that makes you feel better and calm, is advised.\nI would say there are better methods of tracking than stamping. It was like in the Nazi times, you stamped people!\nWhat happens is, when you so something like this, a person feels isolated from the community. When s/he goes out, the entire community may pounce on him.\nSo, s/he feels rejected by the community. This will scar the person. This can also generate xenophobia.\nWhen you have the technology, there are better ways of tracking a person.\nAlso, make the quarantine places reasonably comfortable for people, provide access to their families, and there should be enough guards to see that they don't escape from the facility.\nAbsolutely. Unfortunately, the global estimates say the world may go into a deep recession by July. That will have more impact on young people than older people. The young people will be anxious about job losses, pay cuts, etc.\nWe know the economic consequences will be terrible, but we do not know how terrible it will be.\nThe government should keep the people informed of the situation every day with up-to-date figures, up-to-date resources and correct news so that they don't listen to fake news. Then the anxiety level comes down.\nNot knowing the real picture causes more anxiety.\nAs of now, it seems they are doing the right way.\nOne thing India has done well which other countries have not done is spreading awareness through the telephone. With this, the general level of awareness has gone up. It is a very positive thing.\nBut they should be testing more people. I think more people need to be tested than what is being done now. We need more testing centres. For example, what South Korea has done. They even had drive-in testing centres.\nAs a psychiatrist, I will say, take precautions, but don't panic.

        "news_content_translate_en": "United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday defended calling the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world the \"Chinese Virus\" and said that he is pushing back against the false narrative of China that the US military did this.\n\n\"Well, China was putting out information which was false that our military did this to them. That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I had to call it where it came from. It did come from China,\" the president told reporters at a White House news conference.\n\"So I think it's a very accurate term. I didn't appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give it to anybody,\" Trump said.\nAn hour later, he started his meeting with CEOs of the hotel and tourism industry by using the term \"China Virus\".\nTrump refuted the notion that his using of the phrase created a stigma against the Chinese.\n\"I don't think so. I think saying that our military did to them creates a stigma,\" he asserted.\nDuring the news conference, Trump said he took the right decision by imposing a travel ban on China.\nHe replied in the negative when asked about disruption in the supply chain given that many precursors for pharmaceuticals come from China.\n\"No, I don't see that at all and I think China has every incentive to make sure that things work well. China wants to make sure that things work very well,\" Trump said.\nThe US President said he did not expect China not honouring its trade deal commitment of buying things from the US as a result of the coronavirus.\n\"Well they need our product very badly... We have a good relationship with China. We have a signed agreement. They're going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product,\" he said.\nRight now, he said, China has been sending the US everything it needs. \"But we are looking at some alternatives,\" he added.\nThe US and China have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting conspiracy theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Beijing accusing American officials of stigmatizing an entire nation.\nIn his original tweet on Monday, Trump described US airlines and other industries being \"particularly affected by the Chinese Virus\".\nOn Tuesday, he tweeted that some US states were \"being hit hard by the Chinese Virus\".\nTrump's allies had previously referred to the pandemic as the \"Chinese coronavirus\", but Beijing said it was \"strongly indignant\" over the phrase, which it called \"a kind of stigmatization\".\nThe US should \"immediately stop its unjustified accusations against China,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing.\nA commentary by the official Xinhua news agency said using \"racist and xenophobic names to cast blame for the outbreak on other countries can only reveal politicians' irresponsibility and incompetence which will intensify virus fears.\"\nThe war of words reignited diplomatic tensions between the two countries, which have tussled over trade and other disputes since Trump took office.\nTrump's comments were also criticized inside the US, with warnings it could incite a backlash against the Asian-American community.\n\"Our Asian-American communities -- people YOU serve -- are already suffering. They don't need you fuelling more bigotry,\" tweeted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose state is one of the hardest-hit by the virus in the country.\nThe World Health Organization said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China.\nThe new coronavirus was first detected late last year, with China's own health officials initially saying its source was a live animal market in the central city of Wuhan, whose government had initially tried to cover up the outbreak.\nBut China has sought to distance itself from the virus, saying the origin is still unknown, while seeking global goodwill by offering aid to countries facing serious outbreaks.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels \"to shift blame for COVID-19 to the US\", the State Department said.\nPompeo \"stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat\", the department added.\nThe State Department on Friday summoned Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai to denounce Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested on Twitter last week that \"patient zero\" in the global pandemic may have come from the US.\n\"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,\" tweeted Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media.\nPompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to the \"Wuhan virus\" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatizing.\nYang issued a \"stern warning to the US that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail\", Xinhua said in its summary of the call with Pompeo.\nThe key Chinese foreign policy leader \"noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatized the country, which has enraged the Chinese people\", Xinhua said.\nYang called on the US side to \"correct its wrongful behaviour\".\nTrump is under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his backers have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners.\nWhile COVID-19 has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "\nSome top doctors have said that Indians are strong and imply that we will tide over this, but the right message needs to go out that this is a serious crisis and we have to get our act together.\nDoctors need to be ready for very hard times ahead. Colleagues in US and Italy say they are dealing with a war-like scenario. Italy has reached a point where doctors have to make a choice about which patients have a chance of surviving and which will we let die.\nMy worry is that we are going to get to that point soon because we don't have enough resources.\nWe also have to understand that a lot of doctors in India are old and have diseases themselves. Our buffer stock of protective equipment is very limited, we will be out of stock soon.\nKeeping that in mind, should we expose our elderly doctors with prevailing illnesses? Or should we tell them to keep away and bring young doctors who have very little experience? All these are very hard decisions.\nThe conservative estimate is that between 20% to 60% of all adults are going to be infected -- so if we use up our stock right now, then we will reach a stage when we will not have any masks left for later.\nIf healthcare workers start getting sick when the pandemic is peaking, it will be a huge crisis.\nWe need to take very thoughtful and strategic decisions.\nIf you have come from a country with a high number of cases, then people must self-isolate for 14 days. There is a guideline by the government about how to do that and not infect others staying with you.\nBut that is not enough, we have passed the point when we can contain it from the outside. Containment from the outside is not going to save people from getting infected. It is about flattening the curve.\nLet me explain the concept of R0, which means how many people at an average will an infected person infect. On an average, for Covid, each infected person infects 2 to 3 people -- it means that it is going to propagate exponentially.\nYou can't stop that growth, you can slow it until a sizeable chunk of the population becomes immune.\nHerd immunity is a concept based in vaccination. When a certain number of people have developed immunity to the infection it then disrupts transmission.\nWhat the UK is betting on is that let young people get infected now because then they will have immunity and will disrupt transmission later.\nThey feel they can manage the old people who get sick, but if they let everyone get sick later it will disrupt their healthcare system.\nBut this is a gamble. There is no evidence to show that this is going to happen. Experts have strongly condemned this strategy and in fact UK has thankfully backtracked.\nWe know what has worked in China, South Korea, Japan -- the reason the UK is mulling this option is because no free people will accept the conditions imposed in China. Countries have gone to war for far less freedom.\nThe UK, the USA, Europe and India won't accept that kind of strict conditions. Tomorrow, if the government says everyone stay at home, many will starve.\nThere has to be a universal basic income programme to compensate for the loss of wages, but more importantly there is so much distrust in the government in some communities.\n\nNo one can predict the weather and the response to the weather. It is a new virus, so we don't know whether it may happen or not.\nThe influenza virus cases in temperate climes like the US and Kashmir spike in winter and reduce in summer. The human body temperature is just below 37 degree centigrade, in a fever it can go up to 40 and sometimes above 40.\nIn winter, the contact process changes because people cluster indoors while in the summer people are outdoors.\nWhile in tropical areas like Mumbai, influenza spikes in the monsoon.\nIn case it behaves like an influenza virus, then the cases should decrease. This study applies to seasonal viruses where there is a herd immunity, but when there is a pandemic strain, no one has immunity so the risk of infection is high.\nDengue, influenza, malaria cases spike during the monsoon in Mumbai. There are not enough ICU beds and people die without ICU care of those diseases right now, so what are we going to do even if Covid-19 drops by then?\nThere may be a drop in the rate of new infections. The graph may slow down, but it is still going upwards.\nInstead of 100 new infections per day you may have 50 infections a day, but the total number is still increasing while the ICU beds remain the same -- so every new case in that scenario is a new patient you will find hard to treat.\nIndividually, wash you hands with soap and water frequently for 20 to 40 seconds.\nThink of the virus as a little bit of fat surrounding a core. Like if you have butter or ghee on your hands and it dissolves when you wash your hand with soap and water.\nSoap destroys the fat layer of the virus and it gets destroyed. If you are going to touch your face, at least wash your hands first.\nSecond, avoid touching your face.\nYou must cough into a tissue and throw it away in a closed bin. The other practical way is to cough into the fold of your elbow because the inside of your elbow is not going to touch anything.\nTry and be one metre away from everyone if possible. If someone is sick, then at least two metres away.\nCollectively, I would like to formulate a plan which has a network of medical workers connect with patients through telemedicine and guide them.\nEach one will be assigned to a community area and guide them like say, in a chawl or a slum.\nA building society will make action committees, the action committee will segregate the society into green and red zones with a buffer zone in between.\nInfected people will go in red zones where people will have to share houses, you can't provide separate rooms in India because many homes don't have more than a room and a bathroom.\nThe buffer zone will be a team of action members who need to be young, technology savvy, disease free and non smokers. They have to be segregated into red and green zone workers, red zone workers will work with only sick people.\nIn the green zone we will need to put all the most vulnerable people -- elderly, diabetic, heart and lung disease patients. India is a world leader in diabetes and heart disease.\nYou have to think of radical social reorganisation strategies.\nThe underplayed projection is 1.5 million ICU admissions over the next 12 to 18 months, while we have only about 100,000 ICU beds.\nThere is no way we can scale that up so quickly and even if we do, we don't have enough doctors and nurses and equipment.\nIn India even for the diseases besides Covid-19, we have a shortage. Even if Covid-19 decreases by 90%, the remaining 10% will fill up all the beds and people will start dying of dengue, malaria, typhoid and monsoon related diseases.\nA collapse of societal infrastructure becomes the breeding ground for other diseases.\nHealthcare workers treating coronavirus have been among the hardest hit.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "一些顶级医生曾表示，印度人很强大，并暗示我们将渡过难关，但需要发出正确的信息，即这是一场严重的危机，我们必须采取行动。\n医生们需要为未来的艰难时刻做好准备。美国和意大利的同事说，他们正在处理类似战争的情况。意大利已经到了一个医生必须做出选择的地步，决定哪些病人有生存的机会，我们让谁去死。\n我担心的是，我们很快就会达到这一点，因为我们没有足够的资源。\n我们还必须明白，印度很多医生都很老，自己也有病。我们的保护设备缓冲库存非常有限，很快就会缺货。\n考虑到这一点，我们是否应该让年迈的医生染上流行疾病？或者我们应该告诉他们远离并带上经验很少的年轻医生？所有这些都是非常艰难的决定。\n保守的估计是，20%到60%的成年人将受到感染——所以如果我们现在用完我们的库存，那么我们将达到一个阶段，我们将不会留下任何面具供日后使用。\n如果医疗工作者在大流行达到顶峰时开始生病，那将是一场巨大的危机。\n我们需要做出深思熟虑的战略性决定。\n如果你来自一个病例多的国家，那么人们必须自我隔离14天。政府有一个关于如何做到这一点，而不是感染其他与你在一起的人的指导方针。\n但这还不够，我们已经过了可以从外部遏制的地步。从外部遏制并不能拯救人们免受感染。它是关于平坦的曲线。\n让我解释一下R0的概念，这意味着一个感染者平均会感染多少人。平均来说，对于Covid，每个感染者感染2到3个人——这意味着它将以指数方式传.\n你不能阻止这种增长，你可以减缓它，直到相当大一部分人变得免疫。\n群体免疫是基于疫苗接种的概念。当一定数量的人对这种感染产生了免疫力，它就会破坏传播。\n英国押注的是，让年轻人现在受到感染，因为这样他们就会有免疫力，以后会破坏传播。\n他们觉得自己可以管理生病的老人，但如果他们让每个人以后都生病，就会扰乱他们的医疗体系。\n但这是一场赌博。没有证据表明这会发生。专家们强烈谴责这一战略，事实上，英国已经谢天谢地地采取了倒退。\n我们知道中国、韩国、日本的做法——英国考虑这一选择的原因是，任何自由人都不会接受中国强加的条件。各国为了更少的自由而战。\n英国、美国、欧洲和印度不会接受这种严格的条件。明天，如果政府说每个人都呆在家里，很多人就会挨饿。\n必须有一个普遍的基本收入方案来补偿工资的损失，但更重要的是，在一些社区，政府中存在着如此多的不信任。\n没有人能预测天气和对天气的反应。这是一种新病毒，所以我们不知道它是否会发生。\n像美国和克什米尔这样的温带地区的流感病毒病例在冬季激增，夏季减少。人体体温略低于37摄氏度，发烧时可达40摄氏度，有时可达40摄氏度以上。\n在冬季，由于人们聚集在室内，而在夏季，人们在室外，接触过程发生变化。\n而在像孟买这样的热带地区，流感在季风中急剧上升。\n如果它的行为像流感病毒，那么病例应该减. 这项研究适用于有群体免疫的季节性病毒，但当有大流行株时，没有人有免疫，因此感染的风险很高。\n孟买的登革热、流感、疟疾病例在季风期间激增。现在没有足够的ICU病床，人们在没有ICU护理的情况下死去，那么即使那时Covid-19下降了，我们该怎么办？\n新感染率可能有所下降。图表可能会慢下来，但仍在上升。\n与每天100例新感染不同的是，你一天可能会有50例感染，但总的感染人数仍在增加，而重症监护室的床位保持不变，因此在这种情况下，每一个新病例都是一个新病人，你会发现很难治疗。\n分别用肥皂和水洗手20到40秒。\n把病毒想象成围绕核心的一点脂肪。就像你手上有黄油或酥油，当你用肥皂和水洗手时，它就会溶解。\n肥皂会破坏病毒的脂肪层，然后被破坏。如果你要摸你的脸，至少要先洗手。\n第二，不要碰你的脸。\n你必须用纸巾咳嗽，然后把它扔进一个封闭的箱子里。另一种可行的方法是咳嗽到肘部，因为肘部内侧不会碰到任何东西。\n如果可能的话，尽量离每个人一米远。如果有人病了，那么至少两米远。\n总的来说，我想制定一个计划，让医务人员通过远程医疗与患者建立联系并指导他们。\n每个人都将被分配到一个社区，并像在小屋或贫民窟那样引导他们。\n一个建筑协会将设立行动委员会，行动委员会将把这个协会分成绿色和红色区域，中间有一个缓冲.\n感染者将进入红色区域，在那里人们将不得不共享房屋，你不能在印度提供单独的房间，因为许多家庭没有超过一个房间和一个浴室。\n缓冲区将是一个行动小组成员，他们需要年轻，懂技术，没有疾病和不吸烟。他们必须分为红区和绿区工人，红区工人只和病人一起工作。\n在绿色地带，我们需要安置所有最脆弱的人——老年人、糖尿病患者、心脏病和肺病患者。印度在糖尿病和心脏病方面处于世界领先地位。\n你必须考虑激进的社会重组策略。\n在接下来的12到18个月里，未充分覆盖的预测是150万重症监护病房入院，而我们只有大约10万张重症监护病房床位。\n我们不可能这么快扩大规模，即使扩大规模，我们也没有足够的医生、护士和设备。\n在印度，即使是除了Covid-19以外的疾病，我们也有短缺。即使Covid-19减少了90%，剩下的10%将填满所有的病床，人们将开始死于登革热、疟疾、伤寒和季风相关疾病。\n社会基础设施的崩溃成为其他疾病的滋生地。\n治疗冠状病毒的医护人员受到的打击最大。很可怕，但这就是我们注册成为医生的原因。\n甚至连医生都会害怕，护士也会哭",

2020暂停至2020年4月15日，以防范目前新出现的电晕病毒（COVID-19）疫情。\n声明明确表示，这是“暂停”而不是“推迟”，这意味着这项活动是否将于4月15日开始尚不清楚。\n即使4月15日开赛，也会在没有球迷的情况下闭门进行。\n德里政府周四宣布学校、学院和电影院将关闭至3月31日，但遗憾的是，德里政府也停止了包括IPL2020在内的所有体育盛会。\n西索迪亚说，已经要求地区治安官确保与冠状病毒有关的所有指令都得到执.\n在马哈拉施特拉邦发现17名确诊的冠状病毒患者后，邦政府周五下令关闭孟买、塔纳、纳维孟买、那格浦尔、普纳和皮姆普里钦瓦德等城市的电影院、体育馆、游泳池和公共公园，直至3月30日。\n首席部长Uddhav

        "news_content_translate_en": "The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) epidemic is knocking on Indian doors after infecting tens of thousands of people in over 60 countries across the world. This week, India reported three fresh coronavirus cases, taking the total number of confirmed infections in the country to six. And since then, focus has increasingly shifted to the fallout impact of the new Covid-19 cases and to the question of how ready the country is to fight the global outbreak.\nCovid-19 first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The disease, that leads to illnesses ranging from common cold, fever, shortness of breath to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death, is caused by a kind of coronavirus never seen before. This led to the virus initially being called novel coronavirus 2019 (nCov-19). The disease was later formally labelled Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19). In the media, it's being widely called coronavirus.\nAs of Tuesday, coronavirus has infected more than 89,000 people in over 60 countries. The virus has killed more than 3,000 people in around 8 countries. Most of these cases (80,151 infected and 2,943 dead) are from mainland China, the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, according to figures compiled by news agency Reuters.\nIndia has largely escaped the brunt of the outbreak so far. But the three fresh cases reported this week have brought the spotlight on how prepared the country is to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and how the situation stands currently. Here, we recap everything that's happened in India vis-à-vis the coronavirus outbreak. Remember, this information is as of March 3.\nSo far, India has reported six positive cases of coronavirus, or Covid-19. Of these, three were from Kerala and one each from Delhi, Hyderabad and Jaipur. The Kerala cases were reported in February, while the Delhi, Hyderabad and Jaipur infections were confirmed this week.\nThe initial three coronavirus cases in Kerala were comparatively localised compared to what has happened this week. The three new cases have had secondary consequences as authorities rushed to contain any possible spread of the new virus.\nNoida schools shut\nThe private institution also said it was taking preventive steps such as fumigation of the campus and school buses. Separately, another Noida-based school said it would remain shut for the next few days so that it could sanitise its campus as a precautionary step.\nAir India warns fliers\nAir India has essentially asked passengers of the flight to come forward and get themselves screened for symptoms of coronavirus. Meanwhile, the Air India crew that had flown the flight in question is already under quarantine. The ten crew members have been asked to keep themselves under isolation at home and report to doctors if they notice any symptoms of Covid-19.\nSeparately, low-cost carrier IndiGo, which flew the Bengaluru techie on a Dubai-Bengaluru flight, has placed four crew members from the flight under home observation.\nTelangana, Karnataka begin hunt\nOn Tuesday, Telangana's health minister said that all those whom the Bengaluru techie, who's admitted to a Hyderabad hospital, had come in contact with are beign screened. The minister also said that they are collecting information on those who had travelled with the young man from Dubai to Bengaluru.\nThe minister said that more than half the people the techie had contact with have been identified and that both the Telangana and Karnataka governments are taking care of the people at risk.\nAgra on alert\nAgra in Uttar Pradesh is also on alert after links emerged with both the Delhi coronavirus patient and the Italian tourist who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jaipur.\nThe statement added that the six people had come in contact with the Delhi coronavirus patient. News agency PTI, quoting sources, reported that the 45-year-old man had come to Agra to visit his family and that this is how he came in contact with the six people.\nWith fresh cases being reported in India, the government has gone on war-footing to combat the global threat. Among the new measures taken include:\nIndia's first brush with the coronavirus outbreak was a mammoth operation undertaken by the government to rescue and evacuate Indian citizens stuck in China's Wuhan and on a cruise ship anchored off Japan's coast.\nSimultaneously, an Indian Air Force transport aircraft, which flew to Wuhan with emergency medical supplies, rescued another set of Indians from the virus-hit city on its return journey. All the evacuees from China and Japan underwent 14-day quarantines back home. Most of them have been released after testing negative for Covid-19.\nSo, in short: There have been six confirmed cases of coronavirus in India. Three of these -- all from Kerala -- later tested negative and the patients were discharged after treatment. The three new patients -- reported in Delhi, Hyderabad and Jaipur this week -- are under isolation at different hospitals and the government is working on tracking people the patients came in contact with.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Disposable rubber gloves are indispensable in the global fight against the new coronavirus, yet a month’s lockdown in stricken Malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide.\nThe world’s biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, Top Glove Corp Bhd (TPGC.KL), has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks’ worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told Reuters.\nWe can’t get our gloves to hospitals without cartons, Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview. Hospitals need our gloves. We can’t just supply 50% of their requirement.\nThe virus, which emerged in China at the end of last year, has left Malaysia with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. To halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from March 18 to April 14.\nGlove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. Still, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) said it was lobbying almost every hour to return the industry to full strength to minimize risk to the global fight.\nWe’re shut down, said Evonna Lim, managing director at packaging supplier Etheos Imprint Technology. We fall under an exempted category but still need approval.\nDr Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\nIf we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that’s going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do many medical procedures safely.\nGLOBAL CALL\nWith glove supplies dwindling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on its website this month said here some gloves could be used beyond their designated shelf life. On Tuesday, the United States lifted a ban on imports from Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labor.\nBritain’s Department of Health & Social Care has urged Malaysian authorities to prioritize the production and shipment of gloves that are of utmost criticality for fighting COVID-19, showed a letter dated March 20 to glove maker Supermax Corp (SUPM.KL) and shared with Reuters.\nMARGMA is considering rationing due to the extremely high demand, its president Denis Low said. You can produce as many gloves as you can but then there’s nothing to pack them into.\nUnder normal circumstances, Top Glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. For the remainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength.\nWe are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry, said Low. We are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services, even transportation.\nMalaysia’s Ministry of International Trade and Industry on Tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods.\nAUTOMATION\nDeveloped economies are home to only a fifth of the world’s population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. At 150, U.S. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of China, latest MARGMA data showed.\nMARGMA expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with Malaysia’s market share rising two percentage points to 65%. Thailand usually follows at about 18% and China at 9%.\nTop Glove said orders have doubled since February and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. Its stock, with a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market.\nThe company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed Malaysian firms, along with peer Hartalega Holdings Bhd (HTHB.KL), showed MIDF Research data. Other glove makers include Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd (KRIB.KL) and Careplus Group Bhd (CARE.KL).\nWe are fortunate enough to be in essential goods, said Lim. These few months and at least the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit.\nWith more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, Top Glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labor-intensive domestic suppliers. Packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides.\nThis outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier, said Lim. People will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more.\n",

It plans to convert five more, and Madrid's hotel association has offered a total of 40 of its buildings to be used.\nThe city has also set up a field hospital in the Ifema trade fair complex, not far from the makeshift Ice Palace morgue.\nAs healthcare workers worked around the clock, they also struggled with scarce supplies.\n\"All over the country, you see examples of workers inventing homemade suits using plastics,\" Olga Mediano, a lung specialist at a hospital in Guadalajara, a city east of Madrid, told The Associated Press.\n\"The protective suits are fundamental because without health workers we won't be able to do anything.\"\nMore than 387,000 people worldwide have been infected by the new coronavirus and more than 16,700 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever or coughing. But for some older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. More than 101,000 people have recovered, including more than 60,000 in China.\nTokyo Olympics likely to be postponed\nJapan's NHK television reported that Abe will propose a one-year postponement for the Tokyo Olympics during talks with IOC President Thomas Bach. Abe said a postponement is unavoidable if the 2020 Games cannot be held in a complete manner amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nAbe held telephone talks with Bach after the IOC said it would make a decision on the Tokyo Games over the next four weeks.\nIn Geneva, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris cited a \"glimmer of hope\" in hard-hit Italy after two days of slight declines in the number of new cases and deaths, while cautioning it's \"early days yet\" - and the trend needed to be monitored.\nChina to lift lockdown in Hubei\nIn another positive sign, Chinese authorities said they would finally end a two-month lockdown in hard-hit Hubei province where the coronavirus outbreak first began.\nStill, Harris said the scope of the global outbreak was \"enormous\" and that cases were expected to increase \"considerably.\"\n\"Just to put it in proportion: It took two years in the worst Ebola outbreak we ever had, the West African outbreak, to reach 11,000 deaths,\" Harris said.\nIn a sign of hope, Chinese authorities said they would finally end a two-month lockdown in hard-hit Hubei province where the coronavirus outbreak first began, while nations in Europe, North America and elsewhere pressed harder to enforce the stay-at-home restrictions placed on 1.5 billion people worldwide.\n530 deaths in US\nIn the US, the government was expected to pass a $2 trillion spending plan that would prop up businesses, which has been stalled for days.\nThere have been more than 46,000 infections and 530 deaths in the US as the virus continues to spread.\nIn New York, now one of the world's biggest virus hot spots, authorities rushed to set up the thousands of hospital beds they will need in just weeks to protect the city's 8.4 million people. The mayor warned that the city's hospitals are just 10 days away from shortages in basic supplies, while the state's governor announced plans to convert a New York City convention center into a hospital.\nIn Italy, Spain and France, the pandemic has already pushed national health systems to their breaking points.\nThe outbreak has killed more than 6,000 Italians, the highest death toll of any country. Officials said Monday the virus had claimed just over 600 more lives, down from 793 two days earlier.\nAmid the spiking numbers in Spain, relatives of elderly people and retirement homes' workers are expressing growing concern about the situation in retirement homes across Spain, especially in Madrid.\n\"We live in anguish, we have no information whatsoever,\" said Esther Navarro, whose 97-year-old mother with Alzheimer is at the Residencia Usera in Madrid where some of the cases have been identified.\nSpanish prosecutors are launching a judicial probe after Spanish army troops disinfecting elderly nursing homes discovered elderly people living among death bodies of those who had allegedly contracted the new coronavirus.\nConfusion in Britain\nConfusion rippled through Britain on the first morning after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a three-week halt to all nonessential activity. The government has told most stores to close, banned gatherings of three or more people and said everyone apart from essential workers should leave home only to buy food and medicines or to exercise. But photos showed crowded trains Tuesday on some London subway lines.\n\"I cannot say this more strongly: we must stop all non-essential use of public transport now,\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted. \"Ignoring these rules means more lives lost.\"\nAsian stock markets reacted positively Tuesday, markets in Japan and South Korea posting significant gains after the Federal Reserve said it will lend to small and large businesses and local governments to help them through the crisis.\nThe move toward lockdowns has been influenced by the success of such measures in China, where the virus was first found late last year in the central city of Wuhan. China barred people from leaving or entering the city on Jan. 23, and soon expanded that to cover most of Hubei province, home to 70 million people.\nOn Tuesday, after more than a week in which China said the vast majority of new virus cases were imported from abroad, authorities said the restrictions in Hubei would end. People cleared by health authorities would be able to leave the province after midnight. Wuhan itself will remain locked down until April 8.\nIn contrast to other European nations, German health authorities offered some hope that the country has flattened the exponential spread of the virus, which has already infected nearly 30,000.\nChancellor Angela Merkel's government approved a massive new aid package to cushion the economic fallout of the outbreak, offering more than 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) to tide small companies and entrepreneurs through closures and to pump capital into bigger companies.\n",

        "news_content_translate_en": "Articles and official reports on the new coronavirus are full of terms that most of us don't use daily. Some of them -- Covid-19, for example -- were coined only after the virus emerged in China. Our simple glossary aims to unclutter this specialised vocabulary and help you better understand your news feed. Is there a coronavirus-related term that you'd like to see explained but is not on this list? Let us know in the comments section.\nLet's begin.\nCoronavirus \nCovid-19\nMortality (or fatality) rate \nThis is the percentage of infected people who die. We still can't say with certainty what this number is for the new coronavirus disease, but here are a couple of estimates. On March 3, the World Health Organisation reported a global mortality rate of 3.4%, suggesting the disease is deadlier than the seasonal flu (with a death rate less than 1%). Two past epidemics caused by coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, had much higher mortality rates. (Soon after WHO announced the 3.4 figure, US President Donald Trump raised an eyebrow or two with his \"hunch\" that it was a \"false number\".)\nIn February, a study of 44,672 confirmed cases in Mainland China said 2.3 per cent had died. But the rate showed significant variation with age. It was 14.8 per cent for the 80+ category, and just 0.2% for the 10-19, 20-29 and 30-39 groups. It was also higher for men (2.8%) than for women (1.7%).\nPandemic\nPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\nOn January 30, the World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern -- an \"extraordinary event\" posing a \"public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease\" and potentially needing \"a coordinated international response\". This doesn't happen often: it was only the sixth such declaration made by WHO. When confronted with a PHEIC, a group of experts advises the UN body's director-general (currently Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia) on measures to be implemented in the disease-hit country and elsewhere.\nSars-CoV-2\nShort for \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\", this is the name of the new coronavirus. It was announced on February 11. Don't confuse it with the virus that caused the outbreak of SARS in the early 2000s. \"While related, the two viruses are different,\" the World Health Organisation explains.\n",

Demand is global.\"\nThe surgical masks are made of materials such as polypropylene and polyethylene, produced from raw material of Asian origin, about 95% of the cases, continued. The new coronavirus was for the first time identified in Wuhan, China, a country with the largest number of cases and deaths by a large margin; with the increased demand for masks and the break in the supply of raw materials, Raclac \"left in search of new suppliers\" to combat the scarcity of masks, Nuno Santos said.\nThe commercial director has even revealed that international customers have made \"million-dollar bids\" to guarantee the entire stock of maskYeah. \"We received whatever price we wanted,\" he reiterated. The company, however, refused to \"do not let the usual customers down\", despite international customers, over half of the sales are destined for the Portuguese market, and the responsible party explained.\nRaclac thus preferred \"to ration products to all national customers\"; the aim is that they continue to work as normally as possible during the coronavirus outbreak and to serve their customers, who are mostly Portuguese citizens. \"The outbreak must be a temporary phenomenon. We do not want our customers in an uncomfortable situation, nor do our customers, the Portuguese people,\"he said.\nSubscribe free of charge to newsletters and receive the best of today and the deepest works of the public.\nAs for the Technical Director of the Quality Department, Raquel Pinho, stated that surgical masks, although capable of avoiding contamination, should not be used for more than two hours in the context of this coronavirus epidemic. \"It is appropriate to exchange regularly, for saturation and for the movements we make of the mask,\" he said.\nAccording to the responsible party, in \"various parts of the world\", Raclac will open, at the end of March, the first European unit to produce examination gloves, an article so far manufactured exclusively in Asia. \"Despite being four years old, the project ends up connected to the coronavirus, which originated in the Asian continent.

She was among three dozen deaths linked to the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, the site of one of the first and deadliest U.S. outbreaks. (For interactive graphics tracking coronavirus in the United States and worldwide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0 and https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr )  \n Dreyfuss's final hours illustrate the heartrending choices now facing families who are forced to strike a balance between staying safe and comforting their sick or dying loved ones. Some have been cut off from all contact with parents or spouses who die in isolation, while others have strained to provide comfort or to say their final goodbyes through windows or over the phone.  \n Just three days before his mother died, Briggs had been making weekend plans with her. Now, in his grief, he found himself glued to news reports and frustrated by the mixed messages and slow response from local, state and federal officials.  \n \"You find out all these things, of what they knew when,\" Briggs said.  \n Officials from Life Care Centers of America have said the facility responded the best it could to one of the worst crises ever to hit an eldercare facility, with many staffers stretched to the brink as others were sidelined with symptoms of the virus. As the first U.S. site hit with a major outbreak, the centre had few protocols for a response and little help from the outside amid national shortages of test kits and other supplies.  \n   \n 'NOT FEELING TOO GOOD'  \n A flower child of the 1960's, Dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. After marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women's studies at Cal State Long Beach, where she marched for women's equality and abortion rights.  \n Furious over President Gerald Ford's pardoning of former president Richard Nixon in 1974, Dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to Ford. \"Today is my son's 9th birthday,\" she wrote of a young Briggs. \"I do not feel like celebrating.\"  \n By the time she arrived at the Life Care Center in May 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. Fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.  \n When her son visited on Feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favourites, including diet A&W root beer. She awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.  \n \"Hi Doug,\" she said. \"I'm not feeling too good.\"  \n Still, Dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. The mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging China.  \n In hindsight, Briggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. His mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.  \n At the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.  \n   \n 'A TINY FOOTNOTE'  \n Two days later, Briggs dropped by to see his mom. She felt congested, and staff were going to X-ray her lungs for fluid. Briggs, 54, still saw no red flags, and continued to discuss weekend plans with his mother.  \n \"I hope we can finally watch that new Mr. Rogers movie,\" she told him, referring to the film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood.  \n Briggs hugged his mom before she was wheeled to the imaging room and drove for a quick meal. Soon after, he received a call from the nursing home. His mother was experiencing respiratory failure. She was on her way to the hospital. Doug rushed to nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. By then, she was unresponsive.  \n At the time, there were 59 U.S. cases of coronavirus, a number that has since soared to more than 85,000.  \n After hearing of her sister's sudden hospitalisation, Meri Dreyfuss remembered an earlier voicemail from Barbara: her distant voice, groaning for 30 seconds. When she had first heard it, she assumed Dreyfuss had called by accident, but now she realized her sister was in pain. \"It haunts me that I didn't pick up the phone,\" she said.  \n Briggs spent close to 10 hours the next day in his mom's hospital room. He wore a medical mask and anxiously watched her vital signs – especially the line tracking her oxygen saturation.  \n On his way out the door, a doctor took him aside to say they were testing her for the coronavirus. He remembered the difficulty reconciling the outbreak taking place on television - far away, in China - with what was happening in his mother's hospital room.  \n In the Bay Area, Meri and Hillary Dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on Feb. 28 when Briggs telephoned. After the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.  \n \"I realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn't see her,\" said the middle sister, Hillary. \"And now, it seemed that we shouldn't be seeing Doug, either.\"  \n They cancelled their flights. On Saturday, Feb. 29, Briggs learned his mother's condition was deteriorating. Tough decisions loomed. Briggs and his aunts decided to prioritise making her comfortable over keeping her alive. Doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.  \n She died the next day.  \n Having emerged from a two-week quarantine, Briggs will soon retrieve his mother's cremated remains. The family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.  \n \"All the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis,\" said Hillary Dreyfuss. \"It's almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what's going on.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_cn": "科克兰，华盛顿。-道格·布里格斯穿上手术服，戴上蓝色手套，戴上带面罩的电动呼吸器。他走进病房去看望母亲，向她道别。\n布里格斯把密封在拉链口袋里的手机带进了病房，给妈妈唱了几首他最喜欢的歌。他把它放在她耳边，注意到她随着音乐微微地摆动。\n“她知道我在那儿，”布里格斯笑着回忆道。\n在芭芭拉·史翠珊和披头士乐队的歌曲之间，布里格斯会议最后一次给他的阿姨们打电话，让他们和妹妹说话。”我爱你，很抱歉我没有和你在一起。我希望他们给你的药能让你更舒服。\n芭芭拉·德雷弗斯在“站在我身边”和“在这里，在那里，在任何地方”之间的某个地方去世了——她的手插在她儿子的手上，穿着乳胶。两天后医生才证实她死于由冠状病毒引起的疾病COVID-19。\n现年75岁的德雷福斯是第八位死于大流行的美国病人，目前在全国范围内已造成1200多人死亡，在全球范围内已造成近25000人死亡。她是与华盛顿基尔克兰生命护理院有关的36例死亡病例之一，这是美国最早也是最致命的疫情之一。（有关在美国和世界范围内跟踪冠状病毒的交互式图形，请单击https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0和https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr）\n德雷弗斯的最后几个小时说明了现在面对的家庭令人心碎的选择，他们被迫在保持安全和安慰生病或垂死的亲人之间取得平衡。有些人与孤身一人死去的父母或配偶失去了一切联系，而另一些人则竭力提供安慰，或通过窗户或电话说最后的道别。\n就在他母亲去世前三天，布里格斯一直在和她制定周末计. 现在，在悲痛中，他发现自己紧盯着新闻报道，对来自地方、州和联邦官员的混杂信息和缓慢反应感到沮丧。\n布里格斯说：“你会发现所有这些事情，知道他们什么时候知道的。”。\n美国生命护理中心的官员说，该机构对老年护理机构遭受的最严重危机作出了最好的反应，许多工作人员被拉到了边缘，而其他人则因病毒症状而袖手旁观。作为美国第一个遭受大规模疫情袭击的网站，该中心几乎没有应对方案，在国家测试包和其他物资短缺的情况下，外界也几乎没有帮助。\n“感觉不太好”\n作为60年代的花童，德雷弗斯过着一种以艺术和行动主义为特征的生活。在与高中恋人结婚并生下儿子后，她在加州州立大学长滩分校攻读了妇女研究学位，在那里她为妇女平等和堕胎权利而游行。\n由于1974年杰拉尔德·福特总统赦免了前总统理查德·尼克松，德雷弗斯愤怒地拿起打字机，给福特写了一封愤怒的信。”“今天是我儿子的9岁生日，”她写到一个年轻的布里格斯我不想庆祝。”\n她的儿子说，2019年5月，当她来到生命护理中心时，多年的健康问题已经淡化了其中的一些火花。纤维肌痛和足底筋膜炎把她限制在步行者或轮椅上，慢性阻塞性肺疾病要求她有持续的氧气流动。\n当她儿子2月25日来拜访时，他带来了一袋她最喜欢的食品，包括减肥a&W根啤酒。她从睡梦中醒来，朝他微笑，但暗示自己不舒服。\n“嗨，道格，”她说我感觉不太好。”\n尽管如此，德莱弗斯还是谈到了她即将与姐妹们的一次访问——她想看的电影，她想尝试的餐. 母子俩当时对当时肆虐中国的致命病毒只有模糊的认识。\n事后看来，布里格斯意识到他亲眼目睹了她痛苦的最初迹象。他母亲比平时用的氧气多，呼吸也更紧张。\n一位发言人说，当时，疗养院的工作人员认为他们正在处理流感爆发，并不知道冠状病毒已经开始流行。\n'一个小小的脚注'\n两天后，布里格斯来看望他的妈妈。她感到充血，工作人员正在给她的肺部做X光检查，寻找液体。现年54岁的布里格斯仍然没有看到任何危险信号，继续与母亲讨论周末计划。\n“我希望我们终于可以看罗杰斯先生的那部新电影了，”她对他说，说到这部电影，邻居们度过了美好的一天。\n布里格斯拥抱了妈妈，然后她被推到了影像室，开车去吃了顿快餐。不久，他接到了疗养院的电话。他母亲呼吸衰竭。她正在去医院的路上。道格赶往附近的常绿健康医疗中心。到那时，她已经没有反应了。\n当时，美国共有59例冠状病毒病例，这一数字此后飙升至8.5万多例。\n听到妹妹突然住院的消息后，梅里·德雷弗斯想起了芭芭拉早先的一封语音邮件：她那遥远的声音，呻吟了30秒。当她第一次听到这个消息时，她以为德莱弗斯是偶然打电话来的，但现在她意识到她姐姐很痛苦。”我没接电话，这让我很困扰，”她说。\n布里格斯第二天在他妈妈的病房里呆了将近10个小时。他戴着医用口罩，焦急地观察着她的生命体征，特别是跟踪她的血氧饱和度的线路。\n在他出门的路上，一位医生把他带到一边，说他们正在给她做冠状病毒检. 他还记得，在遥远的中国，在电视上发生的疫情很难与他母亲病房里发生的情况相调和。\n2月28日，在海湾地区，梅里和希拉里·德雷弗斯正在收拾行李，这时布里格斯打电话来。打完电话后，他们决定去看望他们的妹妹会造成太多的感染危险。\n“我意识到那时我们不可能上飞机，因为我们看不见她，”中妹妹希拉里说现在看来，我们也不该去见道格。”\n他们取消了航班。2月29日星期六，布里格斯得知他母亲的病情正在恶化。艰难的决定迫在眉睫。布里格斯和他的阿姨们决定把让她舒服放在首位，而不是让她活着。医生给她注射吗啡以减轻她肺部的沉重感。\n第二天她就死了。\n经过两周的隔离，布里格斯很快就会找回他母亲的火化遗体。这个家庭一直在为如何纪念她在如此混乱的时代的生活而挣扎。\n希拉里·德雷弗斯说：“人们希望在正常的哀悼过程中发生的一切都被这场更大的危机所掩盖。”她的死几乎成了这一切的一个小小的注",

        "news_content_translate_en": "As the Covid-19 pandemic runs its course and wreaks havoc worldwide, the numbers look bleak. Nearly 500,000 people have been infected, and more than 21,000 had died as of Thursday (March 26). \n The international system has reverted to every country for itself, as borders have gone up and globalisation has come down. The world as we knew it is unlikely to be the same, but regions as they were remain relevant. \n The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), as the region’s grouping, must face up to the crisis together or risk being torn apart by it. \n Having gone through the thick and thin of international affairs for more than 52 years, Asean's resilience is self-evident. \n Its first two decades were beset by ideological divisions between Indochina and the rest, but since then Asean has managed to make itself the centre of a broader Asian regionalism, playing an architectural role to promote regional peace and stability by setting up a host of cooperative vehicles and mechanisms —  from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 1989 to the East Asia Summit and Asean Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus more recently. \n But Asean has never faced anything like Covid-19. This is a fast-spreading public health crisis in a region with weak healthcare systems. Case numbers in Southeast Asia so far appear suspect with a lot of downside risks. \n Thailand's infections have surged past 1,000, while Malaysia's is approaching 1,800. A country of 270 million, Indonesia has reported fewer than 800 infections thus far. \n The Philippines, with its population of 110 million, also have reported well below 1,000, and only a handful of cases were reported in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. \n Mortality rates have remained under international benchmarks of 3-4 per cent, based on established numbers of infections. \n What is troubling for Asean is that these numbers likely stem from under-reporting, and will probably rise alarmingly in the weeks ahead. \n To Asean, as a region of 660 million with an aspiring economic community, the coronavirus is an existential danger. Based on known facts, figures and trends, it is not far-fetched to estimate that many millions of people across Asean will come down with the disease. \n Too many could perish in the process, as healthcare systems in less developed Asean countries, such as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, become overwhelmed. \n For Thailand, these three mainland Southeast Asian countries are particularly crucial, because the Thai economy relies on their migrant labourers. \n Asean has banked itself on its development potential and its geostrategic location straddling Northeast Asia, South Asia, and the Asia-Pacific, and Europe. \n It is the fastest-growing region in the world, with a growth trajectory of more than 5 per cent. \n Its internal market comprises relatively young demographics and rising middle classes with increasing purchasing power. \n Although domestic politics are contentious in almost all Asean countries, the region is devoid of cross-border conflict. \n What Asean aspires to be can come to naught if the Covid-19 pandemic is not contained. The disease is making its rounds in waves through countries, with potential reruns. \n The public health crisis is just the beginning, as its impact will spill over into the socio-economic realm — from social re-adjustments due to increased mental and physical isolation to economic recessions and possibly an outright depression, depending on how wide and deep the pandemic runs and how governments responses around the world respond to it. \n Compared to the devastating 1997-98 economic crisis in Southeast Asia, Covid-19 may actually be much worse. \n Back in the late 1990s, Southeast Asian economies, especially Thailand and Indonesia, could find a lender of last resort in the International Monetary Fund and turn to external demand for economic recovery. \n This time, the global market will not be ready and demand won't be enough to prop up Asean's growth and recovery. \n At the minimum, what Asean needs is transparency and coordination. Asean member states must come clean about their number of cases and roll out wider testing. \n Some Asean countries, such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, have imposed virtual lockdowns to slow the coronavirus' spread, but this should be considered for the entire region for a limited period. If not, Asean's pronouncements on health sector cooperation as part of the Asean Vision 2025 will be rendered moot. \n Singapore has led the way by biting the bullet early on and imposing travel restrictions and social distancing measures. In fact, its vigilant handling of the Covid-19 outbreak is being used as an example for other countries. \n Thailand and Malaysia, behind the curve until recently, are following suit. Vietnam, as Asean chair, also has tried to stay on top of the outbreak, having come up with and exported affordable Covid-19 test kits. \n Once Asean's more medically-equipped members manage to contain their outbreaks, they should start helping their other Asean neighbours, as the disparity and inequality between Asean's members are well-known. \n Covid can do a lot of damage across Southeast Asia, but unless Asean responds as a region, the pneumonia-like disease will keep circulating among its 10 members for much longer. \n While Asean has to treat Covid-19 as a regional challenge, the 10-member grouping also has to avoid being further divided by the geopolitics of the coronavirus. \n China appears to have seen the worst of the outbreak and is now extending assistance to other afflicted countries. To reciprocate Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's demonstration of friendship in early February, Beijing sent loads of medical supplies to Cambodia —  similar moves in the future may end up dividing Asean members. \n Asean thus must come to grips with three layers of challenges. First, each Asean member has to be strict about exposing and addressing Covid-19 cases within their borders. \n Then, the whole of Asean must respond to Covid-19 as a united region, through information sharing and effective policy coordination to prevent the disease from returning. \n And last but not least, Asean must find ways not to let external players use the outbreak to further divide Asean. \n Indeed, unless it is dealt with squarely and firmly, Covid-19 has the capacity to undo all of Asean's achievements.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Get TODAY's top news stories via Telegram:  \n SINGAPORE — Singapore Airlines (SIA) will be trying to raise S$15 billion of funds by issuing new shares to its shareholders, firstly through offering S$5.3 billion in new equity and up to S$9.7 billion of 10-year mandatory convertible bonds.  \n Existing shareholders can buy these new issuances proportionate to the amount of SIA shares they are already holding, and these shares will be treated as equity in SIA’s balance sheet.  \n In a press release in the early hours of Friday (March 27), Singapore’s national carrier said that its largest shareholder, Temasek Holdings, will vote in favour of SIA’s plans and buy all remaining shares and bonds, in addition to the full amount it is entitled to. \n The state investment firm owns about 55 per cent of SIA.  \n The money raised from these issuances will be used to fund capital and operational expenditure requirements, the airline said.  \n More than 1.7 billion of the shares to be issued will be offered at S$3 each, which is more than 50 per cent lower than SIA’s last closing share price at S$6.50 on Wednesday. \n The bonds will be offered over a few tranches, with S$3.5 billion issued first, while the rest will take place over the subsequent months. \n SIA also said that it has arranged a S$4 billion bridge loan facility with DBS bank — another portfolio company of Temasek — which would help support its near-term liquidity needs.  \n The statement from the airline came after Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said in Parliament on Thursday that it is considering a corporate action which would be supported by Temasek.  \n “I welcome Temasek’s decision to lend support to SIA. SIA is an outstanding airline and a strategic asset for Singapore. \n “Through the government support for the aviation sector and if necessary, more direct support measures, we will make sure that SIA is able to come through this in good shape,” Mr Heng said when he was unveiling more measures for the aviation sector hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.  \n The coronavirus that has infected more than 410,000 people across more than 190 countries has simultaneously wreaked havoc on the aviation industry globally, with demand for international air travel obliterated and governments closing their borders to curb the spread of the disease which had its first outbreak in Wuhan, China. \n SIA has not been spared and has had to implement cost-cutting measures recently, as its chief executive officer Goh Choon Pong announced that he would take a 30 per cent pay cut and others in senior management also taking a 20 to 25 per cent pay cut.  \n Its pilots will be required to take up to seven days of no-pay leave a month from April, while other staff members will have to take one to two days of no-pay leave between April and May.  \n On Thursday morning, the airline announced a trading halt. \n Earlier this week, SIA said that it will ground almost all its fleet that was originally scheduled until the end of April.  \n The aviation industry supports more than 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product and 375,000 jobs. \n SIA, SilkAir and Scoot account for more than half of the passengers flying in and out of Changi Airport, SIA said. \n SIA chairman Peter Seah said: “This is an exceptional time for the SIA Group. Since the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak, passenger demand has fallen precipitously amid an unprecedented closure of borders worldwide.  \n “We are especially grateful for Temasek’s strong vote of confidence.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Older malaria drugs are being studied, and in some cases used, to treat or try to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, even though there is no firm evidence to show they are effective. Studies are underway in a number of countries, including China, France and the United States, to see whether the pills - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine - may have a role to play in the rapidly spreading pandemic.  \n U.S. President Donald Trump has touted the malaria drugs as \"a game changer.\" But the Food and Drug Administration and other health experts said trials must first ensure the medicines are effective and safe for use in this patient population.  \n  \n WHY ARE MALARIA DRUGS UNDER CONSIDERATION?  \n There are currently no vaccines or U.S.-approved treatments for the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that has killed more than 18,000 worldwide, so even the most severely ill patients largely receive only supportive care such as breathing assistance.  \n On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotal use of hydroxychloroquine at different doses.  \n Chloroquine is a synthetic form of quinine, which is found on the bark of the cinchona plant. It has been used for hundreds of years in South America to treat fever.  \n Chloroquine was first synthesized in the 1930s. A version called hydroxychloroquine, in use since the 1950s, is considered to be less toxic, according to studies. Both drugs can cause serious side effects, including vision loss, heart problems or even death, if used incorrectly.  \n The drugs are used to combat malaria, which is caused by a parasite spread through mosquito bites, because they interrupt its ability to digest a host's blood cells.  \n Scientists have detailed biochemical proprieties of chloroquine that indicate it could be used against some viral infections. These include direct antiviral effects, such as blocking steps needed by certain viruses to replicate, and its ability to suppress production and release of proteins involved in inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.  \n In addition to malaria, hydroxychloroquine is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  \n  \n WHAT DOES THE DATA SAY?  \n Data has begun to emerge from some coronavirus trials, but most information so far is preliminary.  \n A French team last week said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo. But the trial is small and results on patient outcomes are still awaited.  \n Chinese researchers last month reported trial results showing that chloroquine treatment of COVID-19 patients had clinical and virologic benefit versus a comparison group. It has been added as a recommended treatment for the illness in China, where the virus first emerged in December.  \n This week, the Journal of Zhejiang University reported disappointing results from a 30-patient Shanghai study of hydroxychloroquine. It showed the drug worked no better than standard care for patients with COVID-19.  \n The University of Minnesota has launched a 1,500-person trial to see whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 in people exposed to the virus - including healthcare workers and family members of infected people.  \n Other trials of the malaria drugs are ongoing or set to start in the United Kingdom, Norway and Thailand.  \n New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose state is the epicentre of the U.S. outbreak with more than 25,000 cases, on Sunday said it had acquired hundreds of thousands of doses of the malaria drugs to use in a clinical trial.  \n  \n IS THERE ENOUGH TO GO AROUND?  \n In the United States, prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have already spiked and are in short supply, according to pharmacists.  \n Several makers of the generic medicines said they are increasing production of chloroquine pills. Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Mylan NV and Bayer AG have donated large quantities of the drugs to health authorities.  \n  \n PRESCRIPTION ONLY!  \n Health officials caution that no one should be taking these drugs to treat or prevent coronavirus infection without medical supervision and a prescription.  \n In Arizona, a man died and his wife was hospitalized after taking a nonmedical form of chloroquine used to fight parasites in aquariums.  \n \"Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we understand that people are trying to find new ways to prevent or treat this virus, but self-medicating is not the way to do so,” said Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the poison and drug information centre at Arizona-based Banner Health.

        "news_content_translate_en": "NEW YORK — No matter how you look at the numbers, one country stands out from the rest: South Korea. \n In late February and early March, the number of new coronavirus infections in the country exploded from a few dozen, to a few hundred, to several thousand. \n At the peak, medical workers identified 909 new cases in a single day, Feb 29, and the country of 50 million people appeared on the verge of being overwhelmed. But less than a week later, the number of new cases halved. Within four days, it halved again — and again the next day. \n On Sunday (March 22), South Korea reported only 64 new cases, the fewest in nearly a month, even as infections in other countries continue to soar by the thousands daily, devastating health care systems and economies. Italy records several hundred deaths daily; South Korea has not had more than eight in a day. \n South Korea is one of only two countries with large outbreaks, alongside China, to flatten the curve of new infections. And it has done so without China’s draconian restrictions on speech and movement, or economically damaging lockdowns like those in Europe and the US. \n As global deaths from the virus surge past 15,000, officials and experts worldwide are scrutinising South Korea for lessons. And those lessons, while hardly easy, appear relatively straightforward and affordable: swift action, widespread testing and contact tracing, and critical support from citizens. \n Yet other hard-hit nations did not follow South Korea’s lead. Some have begun to show interest in emulating its methods — but only after the epidemic had accelerated to the point that they may not be able to control it any time soon. \n President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden have both called South Korea’s president, Mr Moon Jae-in, to request details on the country’s measures, according to Mr Moon’s office. \n The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has hailed South Korea as demonstrating that containing the virus, while difficult, “can be done”. He urged countries to “apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere”. \n South Korean officials caution that their successes are tentative. A risk of resurgence remains, particularly as epidemics continue raging beyond the country’s borders. \n Still, Mr Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has repeatedly raised South Korea as a model, writing on Twitter, “South Korea is showing Covid-19 can be beat with smart, aggressive public health.” \n LESSON 1: INTERVENE FAST, BEFORE IT’S A CRISIS \n Just one week after the country’s first case was diagnosed in late January, government officials met with representatives from several medical companies. They urged the companies to begin immediately developing coronavirus test kits for mass production, promising emergency approval. \n Within two weeks, though South Korea’s confirmed cases remained in the double digits, thousands of test kits were shipping daily. The country now produces 100,000 kits per day, and officials say they are in talks with 17 foreign governments about exporting them. \n Officials also swiftly imposed emergency measures in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million where contagion spread fast through a local church. \n “South Korea could deal with this without limiting the movement of people because we knew the main source of infection, the church congregation, pretty early on,” said Dr Ki Mo-ran, an epidemiologist advising the government’s coronavirus response. “If we learned about it later than we did, things could have been far worse.” \n South Koreans, unlike Europeans and Americans, were also primed to treat the coronavirus as a national emergency, after a 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) in the country killed 38. \n The coronavirus is thought to have a five-day incubation period, often followed by a period of mild symptoms that could be mistaken for a cold, when the virus is highly communicable. This pattern creates a lag of a week or two before an outbreak becomes apparent. What looks like a handful of cases can be hundreds; what looks like hundreds can be thousands. \n “Such characteristics of the virus render the traditional response, which emphasises lockdown and isolation, ineffective,” said Mr Kim Gang-lip, South Korea’s vice health minister. “Once it arrives, the old way is not effective in stopping the disease from spreading.” \n LESSON 2: TEST EARLY, OFTEN AND SAFELY \n South Korea has tested far more people for the coronavirus than any other country, enabling it to isolate and treat many people soon after they are infected. \n The country has conducted over 300,000 tests, for a per capita rate more than 40 times that of the US. \n “Testing is central because that leads to early detection, it minimises further spread and it quickly treats those found with the virus,” Ms Kang Kyung-wha, South Korea’s foreign minister, told the BBC, calling the tests “the key behind our very low fatality rate as well”. \n Though South Korea is sometimes portrayed as having averted an epidemic, thousands of people were infected and the government was initially accused of complacency. Its approach to testing was designed to turn back an outbreak already underway. \n To spare hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed, officials opened 600 testing centers designed to screen as many people as possible, as quickly as possible — and keep health workers safe by minimising contact. \n At 50 drive-thru stations, patients are tested without leaving their cars. They are given a questionnaire, a remote temperature scan and a throat swab. The process takes about 10 minutes. Test results are usually back within hours. \n At some walk-in centres, patients enter a chamber resembling a transparent phone booth. Health workers administer throat swabs using thick rubber gloves built into the chamber’s walls. \n Relentless public messaging urges South Koreans to seek testing if they or someone they know develop symptoms. Visitors from abroad are required to download a smartphone app that guides them through self-checks for symptoms. \n Offices, hotels and other large buildings often use thermal image cameras to identify people with fevers. Many restaurants check customers’ temperatures before accepting them. \n LESSON 3: CONTACT TRACING, ISOLATION AND SURVEILLANCE \n When someone tests positive, health workers retrace the patient’s recent movements to find, test — and, if necessary, isolate — anyone the person may have had contact with, a process known as contact tracing. \n This allows health workers to identify networks of possible transmission early, carving the virus out of society like a surgeon removing a cancer. \n South Korea developed tools and practices for aggressive contact tracing during the Mers outbreak. Health officials would retrace patients’ movements using security camera footage, credit card records, even GPS data from their cars and cellphones. \n “We did our epidemiological investigations like police detectives,” Dr Ki said. “Later, we had laws revised to prioritise social security over individual privacy at times of infectious disease crises.” \n As the coronavirus outbreak grew too big to track patients so intensively, officials relied more on mass messaging. \n South Koreans’ cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. Websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people’s travel — which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks. \n People who believe they may have crossed paths with a patient are urged to report to testing centres. \n South Koreans have broadly accepted the loss of privacy as a necessary trade-off. \n People ordered into self-quarantine must download another app, which alerts officials if a patient ventures out of isolation. Fines for violations can reach US$2,500 (S$3,600). \n By identifying and treating infections early, and segregating mild cases to special centres, South Korea has kept hospitals clear for the most serious patients. Its case fatality rate is just over 1 per cent, among the lowest in the world. \n LESSON 4: ENLIST THE PUBLIC’S HELP \n There aren’t enough health workers or body-temperature scanners to track everybody, so everyday people must pitch in. \n Leaders concluded that subduing the outbreak required keeping citizens fully informed and asking for their cooperation, said Mr Kim, the vice health minister. \n Television broadcasts, subway station announcements and smartphone alerts provide endless reminders to wear face masks, pointers on social distancing and the day’s transmission data. \n The messaging instills a near-wartime sense of common purpose. Polls show majority approval for the government’s efforts, with confidence high, panic low and scant hoarding. \n “This public trust has resulted in a very high level of civic awareness and voluntary cooperation that strengthens our collective effort,” Mr Lee Tae-ho, the vice minister of foreign affairs, told reporters earlier this month. \n Officials also credit the country’s nationalised health care system, which guarantees most care, and special rules covering coronavirus-related costs, as giving even people with no symptoms greater incentive to get tested. \n IS THE KOREAN MODEL TRANSFERABLE? \n For all the attention to South Korea’s successes, its methods and containment tools are not prohibitively complex or expensive. \n Some of the technology the country has used is as simple as specialised rubber gloves and cotton swabs. Of the seven countries with worse outbreaks than South Korea’s, five are richer. \n Experts cite three major hurdles to following South Korea’s lead, none related to cost or technology. \n One is political will. Many governments have hesitated to impose onerous measures in the absence of a crisis-level outbreak. \n Another is public will. Social trust is higher in South Korea than in many other countries, particularly Western democracies beset by polarisation and populist backlash. \n But time poses the greatest challenge.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "纽约-不管你怎么看这些数字，有一个国家在其他国家中脱颖而出：韩国。\n2月下旬和3月上旬，该国新的冠状病毒感染人数从几十人激增到几百人，再到几千人。\n在高峰时期，医务人员在2月29日的一天内发现了909例新病例，这个拥有5000万人口的国家似乎处于不堪重负的边缘。但不到一周后，新病例数量减少了一半。四天之内，它又减半了——第二天又减半了。\n周日（3月22日），韩国仅报告了64例新病例，这是近一个月来最少的一次，尽管其他国家的感染率继续以每天数千人的速度飙升，破坏性的医疗系统和经济。意大利每天都有几百人死亡；韩国一天的死亡人数不超过8人。\n韩国是仅有的两个与中国一起爆发大规模疫情的国家之一，这两个国家的疫情将使新的感染率曲线趋于平稳。而且，中国这样做并没有受到中国对言论和行动的严厉限制，也没有像欧美那样对经济造成破坏的封锁。\n随着全球死于该病毒的人数激增至15000人以上，世界各地的官员和专家正在仔细研究韩国的经验教训。这些教训，虽然不容易，但似乎相对简单和负担得起：迅速行动，广泛的测试和联系追踪，以及公民的关键支持。\n然而，其他遭受重创的国家并没有效仿韩国。一些人已经开始对模仿其方法表现出兴趣，但只是在流行病加速到他们可能无法很快控制它的程度之后。\n据明月办公室消息，法国总统马克龙和瑞典首相勒夫文均致电韩国总统文在寅，要求了解韩国措施的细.\n世界卫生组织（世卫组织）主席特德罗斯·阿达诺姆·盖布雷耶苏（Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus）博士称赞韩国表明，遏制这种病毒虽然困难，但“是可以做到的”。他敦促各国“吸取韩国和其他国家的经验教训”。\n韩国官员警告说，他们的成功只是暂时的。特别是当流行病继续肆虐于该国境外时，死灰复燃的风险依然存在。\n不过，美国食品药品监督管理局（Food and Drug Administration）前委员斯科特•戈特利布（Scott Gottlieb）曾多次将韩国作为一个典范，他在Twitter上写道：“韩国正显示，聪明、积极的公共卫生可以打败Covid-19。”\n第1课：在危机来临之前，迅速干预\n就在今年1月下旬该国首例病例确诊一周后，政府官员会见了几家医疗公司的代表。他们敦促这些公司立即开始开发用于大规模生产的冠状病毒检测试剂盒，并承诺将获得紧急批准。\n两周内，尽管韩国确诊病例数仍保持在两位数，但每天仍有数千个测试包在运送。该国目前每天生产10万套，官员们说，他们正在与17个外国政府就出口它们进行谈判。\n官员们还迅速在大邱实施了紧急措施，这个拥有250万人口的城市的传染病在当地一个教堂迅速蔓延。\n建议韩国政府应对冠状病毒的流行病学家Ki Mo-ran博士说：“韩国可以在不限制人员流动的情况下解决这一问题，因为我们很早就知道主要的感染源，即教会集会。”。“如果我们比以前知道得晚，情况可能会更糟。”\n韩国人与欧美人不同，在2015年爆发的中东呼吸综合征（Mers）导致38人死亡后，韩国人也准备将冠状病毒作为国家紧急事件来对.\n冠状病毒被认为有5天的潜伏期，在病毒高度传染性的时候，通常会有一段轻微的症状，可能被误认为是感冒。这种模式在疫情显现之前会造成一两周的延迟。少数病例可能是数百例，而数百例可能是数千例。\n韩国卫生部副部长金刚利表示：“这种病毒的特征使得强调封锁和隔离的传统应对措施无效。”。“一旦到达，旧方法就不能有效地阻止疾病的传播。”\n第二课：尽早、经常、安全地考试\n韩国检测出的冠状病毒感染者比任何其他国家都要多得多，这使得韩国能够在许多人感染冠状病毒后很快对他们进行隔离和治疗。\n中国已经进行了30多万次测试，人均测试率是美国的40多倍。\n韩国外交部长姜京华女士对英国广播公司（BBC）表示：“检测是关键，因为这会导致早期发现，将进一步传播降到最低，并能迅速治疗发现的病毒携带者。”。\n尽管韩国有时被描绘成避免了一场流行病，但数千人受到感染，政府最初被指责自满。它的测试方法旨在扭转已经开始的疫情。\n为了避免医院和诊所不堪重负，官员们开设了600个检测中心，旨在尽可能快地筛查尽可能多的人，并通过尽量减少接触来保证卫生工作者的安全。\n在50个直达站，患者在不下车的情况下接受测试。他们得到了一份问卷，一个远程温度扫描和一个咽喉拭子。这个过程大约需要10分钟。测试结果通常在数小时内返.\n在一些步行中心，病人进入一个类似透明电话亭的房间。卫生工作人员使用嵌入房间墙壁的厚橡胶手套来管理喉部拭子。\n无情的公开信息敦促韩国人寻求检测，如果他们或他们认识的人出现症状。来自国外的游客需要下载一个智能手机应用程序，引导他们通过自我检查症状。\n办公室、酒店和其他大型建筑物经常使用热成像摄像机来识别发烧的人。很多餐馆在接受顾客之前都会检查他们的体温。\n第3课：接触者追踪、隔离和监视\n当有人检测呈阳性时，卫生工作者会追踪病人最近的活动，以找到、检测——如果有必要，隔离——病人可能接触过的任何人，这一过程被称为接触追踪。\n这使得卫生工作者能够及早发现可能的传播网络，像外科医生切除癌症一样将病毒从社会中切割出来。\n韩国在Mers爆发期间开发了用于积极追踪接触者的工具和做法。卫生官员将使用安全摄像机镜头、信用卡记录、甚至来自他们汽车和手机的GPS数据来追踪病人的行踪。\n“我们像警探一样进行流行病学调查，”基博士说。“后来，我们修改了法律，在传染病危机时，将社会保障置于个人隐私之上。”\n由于冠状病毒爆发的规模太大，无法如此密集地追踪病人，官员们更多地依赖于群发信息。\n每当在韩国人的地区发现新病例，他们的手机就会发出紧急警报。网站和智能手机应用程序逐小时、有时逐分钟详细记录了受感染者的旅行时间表——他们乘坐哪辆巴士，何时何地上下车，甚至他们是否戴着口.\n那些认为自己可能与病人有过交集的人被敦促向检测中心报告。\n韩国人普遍认为，隐私权的丧失是一种必要的权衡。\n被命令进行自我隔离的人必须下载另一个应用程序，如果病人冒险脱离隔离状态，该应用程序会提醒官员。违规罚款可达2500美元（3600新元）。\n通过及早发现和治疗感染，并将轻微病例隔离到特殊中心，韩国为最严重的病人保持了医院的畅通。它的病死率略高于1%，是世界上最低的。\n第四课：寻求公众的帮助\n没有足够的卫生工作者或体温扫描仪来跟踪每个人，所以每天人们都必须投入。\n卫生部副部长金正日表示，各国领导人的结论是，控制疫情需要让公民充分了解情况，并要求他们予以合作。\n电视广播、地铁站公告和智能手机提醒提供无休止的提醒，提醒人们戴上口罩、社交距离指针和当天的传输数据。\n这条信息灌输了一种近乎战时的共同目标意识。民调显示，多数人支持政府的努力，信心高涨，恐慌情绪低落，囤积不多。\n本月早些时候，外交部副部长李泰浩对记者表示：“这种公众信任导致了非常高的公民意识和自愿合作，加强了我们的集体努力。”。\n官员们还认为，该国国有化的医疗保健体系保证了大部分医疗服务，并制定了包括冠状病毒相关费用的特别规定，即使是没有症状的人也有更大的动力接受检查。\n韩国模式可以转让吗？\n尽管韩国的成功备受关注，但其方法和遏制工具并不复杂或昂.\n该国使用的一些技术非常简单，如专业的橡胶手套和棉签。在爆发疫情比韩国更严重的7个国家中，有5个国家更富有。\n专家们列举了追随韩国的三大障碍，这些障碍与成本和技术无关。\n一是政治意愿。在没有爆发危机级别的疫情的情况下，许多政府对实施繁重措施犹豫不决。\n另一个是公众意愿。韩国的社会信任度高于许多其他国家，尤其是受到两极分化和民粹主义反弹困扰的西方民主国家。\n但时间是最大的挑战。Ki博士说，对于那些深陷流行病的国家来说，要像韩国那样迅速或有效地控制疫情爆发，可能已经“太晚了”。\n中国以关闭经济为代价，扭转了湖北省首次爆发的灾难性疫情，湖北省的规模超过了大多数欧洲国家。\n前FDA委员Gottlieb在Twitter上写道，韩国的方法可能对美国有所帮助，尽管“我们可能失去了像韩国一样取得成果的机会”。“我们必须尽一切努力避免意大利所承受的悲惨痛苦。”《纽约时报",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday opened the door to a radical shift in the U.S. government's relationship to private industry as the coronavirus outbreak upends the nation's economy, saying he would back the government taking stakes in certain companies.  \n Asked if he supported the federal government moving to take an equity stake in some companies, Trump said: \"I do. I really do.\"  \n Trump, speaking at a news conference at the White House, added: \"We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry.\"  \n The White House did not immediately respond when asked if purchasing shares in battered companies was really under consideration. The U.S. government rarely invests in public companies except in the case of bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs.  \n The COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has sickened more than 11,000 people in the United States and killed more than 180, upending American life as it shutters schools, restaurants and businesses across the country.  \n Bailout requests related to the spread of health crisis, in the form of direct grants, loans, loan guarantees and tax relief, have topped $2 trillion. Companies generally do not welcome government ownership for fear they would lose control of their business, however.  \n  \n PRECEDENT  \n Taking stakes in companies is not without precedent in times of crisis.  \n The Bush and Obama administrations loaned the auto industry, including General Motors and Chrysler, which is now controlled by Italy’s Fiat, $80 billion to avoid the collapse of the industry that they felt would result in the loss of millions of U.S. jobs.  \n The U.S. government spent about $50 billion to bail out GM alone. As a result of the company’s 2009 bankruptcy, the government’s investment was converted to a 61 percent equity stake in the Detroit-based automaker, plus preferred shares and a loan. The government no longer has a stake in the company.  \n Just last month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider taking a \"controlling stake\" in Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson to counter China-based Huawei’s dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology.  \n The Trump administration accuses Huawei of being able to spy on customers and has led a global campaign to convince allies to keep the blacklisted company out of their 5G networks.  \n Even if the idea of ownership stakes is ultimately discarded, sweeping measures to mitigate the economic fallout from coronavirus seem inevitable.  \n Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday urged Congress to pass a $1 trillion economic relief measure by early next week, adding the government was focused on being able to provide liquidity to companies.  \n Asked if a trillion dollar stimulus is enough, Trump said: \"We will know about that later. We'll see what happens. It depends how long, so much depend on what's going on in this room, in terms of the medical. If we can stop it in its track the virus, it's plenty. If we can't, we'll have to go back and talk.\" REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — The Government on Wednesday (March 18) advised Singaporeans to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect, superseding an earlier travel advisory announced just three days ago to defer all non-essential travel abroad. \n The expansion of the advisory is to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being infected with the virus when they are overseas, and then spreading it to other Singaporeans when they return, the Health Ministry (MOH) said in a press release on Wednesday. \n From 11.59pm on Friday, all Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore will also be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice. \n Short-term visitors subjected to this notice have to provide proof of the place where they will be staying in for isolation. \n The extra measures for all travellers entering the country is aimed at reducing the risk of further importation leading to community spread in Singapore, it added. \n  \n The latest expansion of travel restrictions come as Singapore confirmed 47 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday— the highest single-day jump by a wide margin. \n Out of the new cases, 33 of them were imported, and 30 of them are Singapore residents who have returned from abroad, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said at a press briefing by the multi-ministry Covid-19 taskforce. \n Over the past three days, almost 70 per cent of Singapore’s new Covid-19 cases were imported, most of whom were Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning here after they had travelled overseas. \n National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who also co-chaired the briefing, said that the Government expects the number of imported cases to go up as more Singaporeans return home.  \n “Like how we flew the chartered flight back from Wuhan, a number of Singaporeans on those flights were infected and that was one city (in China). Now we have many cities all over the world in Europe where it is circulating quite quickly,” he said.  \n The recent imported cases are Singapore residents who came back one or two weeks ago, Mr Wong said.  \n He also said that the Government has decided to get people here to defer all travel because many families are away despite the earlier travel advisory urging them to defer non-essential travel.  \n “We urge everyone to reconsider any upcoming travel plans,” Mr Wong stressed.  \n As for Singapore residents who are returning before the stay-home notice kicks in on Friday for inbound travellers, Mr Wong called on them to “do the responsible thing” and consider self-isolation at their own homes for a few days or, if possible, for 14 days.   \n “If you have any symptoms, immediately go and see a doctor. It’s the responsible thing to do and the best way to protect loved ones and family members,” he added.  \n Mr Wong also said that the Ministry of Education will announce new measures to complement this new travel restriction, whereby students who have travelled with their family overseas during this period will be asked to stay at home for 14 days, even if they return before the Friday deadline.  \n EMPLOYERS TO GET APPROVAL FOR WORK PASS HOLDERS \n As for new and existing work pass holders returning to Singapore, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a statement on Wednesday that those entering Singapore from 11.59pm this Friday will need to obtain MOM’s approval before they begin their journey back. \n This applies to existing work pass holders and those who have received in-principle approval for their passes and have yet to enter Singapore. \n Employers of these work pass holders must apply for the entry approval on MOM’s website. \n They must declare to the ministry that they have arranged for suitable accommodation for these employees during the 14-day stay-home notice. \n “Employers should inform their affected employees (including their dependants) not to make travel plans to Singapore until approval has been received from MOM,” the ministry said. \n They will have to send MOM’s approval letter to the employees, who will need to show it to the airline crew upon check-in and at the border checkpoints when they arrive in Singapore. \n SPREAD OF VIRUS GAINING PACE \n MOH said that there has been a sharp increase in the number of Covid-19 cases globally, and the spread is gaining pace across the world. \n To date, there are close to 200,000 confirmed cases across 159 countries, with more than 7,900 deaths. \n “Many countries have seen an exponential rise in cases recently, and more than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the past three days. \n “Globally the number of cases and deaths has surpassed those in China since the beginning of the outbreak,” MOH stated. \n Previously announced measures to ban short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain from entering Singapore remain in effect. \n Those who are on stay-home notices would have to remain in their place of residence at all times for 14 days after entering Singapore. \n This new travel restriction will also apply to those entering Singapore via the land checkpoints from Malaysia, Mr Wong said. \n “But for people like truck drivers or others who move between Singapore and Malaysia every day, separate arrangements will have to be worked out by both countries. It doesn’t make sense to put this group under stay-home notice,” Mr Wong said at the press briefing. \n Malaysia’s nationwide lockdown, which began on Wednesday, has already imposed restrictions on the land crossings, the MOH statement read. \n Measures to provide for the many drivers driving across the Causeway to deliver goods are being discussed through ongoing bilateral discussions, Mr Wong added. \n “There is understanding that this type of to-ing and fro-ing reflects the interdependency of both countries and we need separate arrangements for that.” \n Existing measures, such as requiring all inbound travellers who exhibit fever or other symptoms of respiratory illnesses to undergo a swab test at the checkpoints, would still apply. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — From Monday (March 16), the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will require all employers and employment agencies planning for their foreign domestic workers to enter Singapore to obtain the Ministry's approval before they commence their journey. \n The need for MOM's entry approval extends to all work pass holders and their dependants with travel history to Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom within the last 14 days, regardless of the nationality of the work pass holder. \n The new measures will take effect from 11.59pm on Monday. \n FOREIGN DOMESTIC WORKERS \n In addition to requiring entry approval from MOM, maids will also have to serve a mandatory 14-day stay-home notice upon their arrival. This will apply to all new and returning maids travelling to Singapore from any country. \n “The new measures take into consideration that foreign domestic workers live with families and many look after young children and the elderly,” MOM said in a statement on Sunday. \n New workers must serve their stay-home notice at alternative accommodations such as dormitories, hostels or hotels before they can be deployed, while returning workers can serve it at their employer's residential address or other accommodation. \n Employers and employment agencies can apply for the entry approval online, said MOM. Applicants will have to provide proper housing and upkeep arrangements for their maids and ensure that they comply with the stay-home notice. They must also ensure that the maid has access to a local mobile phone and remains contactable by the ministry during the 14-day period. \n The ministry added that it will provide an assistance package to support Singaporean or Permanent Resident employers affected by the new requirements. They can receive S$60 daily per affected worker and have their levy waived during the 14-day period.    \n Employers can apply for the package within 90 days of the foreign domestic worker completing the stay-home notice. To be eligible, the maid must not serve the stay-home notice at the employer's residential address. Additionally, if they have a valid work pass, they must have left Singapore on or before March 15. Otherwise, their work pass application must be submitted to MOM on or before March 15. \n MOM added that foreign domestic workers should not make travel plans to Singapore before the ministry’s approval has been obtained. After approval has been given, the approval letter must be sent to the worker, who will need to show it to airline staff during check-in and to Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officials upon arriving at the checkpoint in Singapore. \n MOM warned that enforcement action — including the revocation of work passes and suspension of work pass privileges — will be taken if employers or employment agencies do not comply with the new requirements. Employment agencies who violate the requirements will also be given demerit points. \n \"Employment agencies, employers and their foreign domestic workers have a collective duty to ensure that the entry approval and the stay-home notice requirements are complied with,\" the Ministry said. \n Additionally, MOM \"strongly encouraged\" maids to spend their rest days at home, in light of the social distancing measures that have been introduced in Singapore. \n Workers who have errands to run on their rest day should do so on a weekday when public spaces are less crowded. Employers should also encourage their maids to avoid gathering in public places, MOM added. \n Employers should also not assign work to their maids if they agree to spend their rest day at home. Alternatively, if a maid decides to forgo her rest day, her employer must provide compensation. \n WORK PASS HOLDERS \n The new entry approval requirement will apply to existing work pass holders currently out of Singapore and in-principle approval holders who have yet to enter the country, MOM said in a separate statement on Sunday. \n The affected work pass holders must serve a mandatory 14-day stay-home notice upon arriving in Singapore and employers must declare to MOM that they have arranged for suitable premises to house their affected employees for the duration of the notice period. \n Employers can apply for entry approval online and should inform their affected employees not to make travel plans until MOM approval has been received. \n Similar to the case of foreign domestic workers, employers of the affected work pass holders must send the MOM approval letter to their employees, who will need to show it to airline staff upon check-in and at the ICA checkpoint in Singapore. \n Those who do not comply with MOM's requirements could have their work pass revoked or work pass privileges withdrawn, the Ministry said. \n Additionally, MOM has extended its leave of absence support programme to those serving stay-home notices due to Covid-19 since Feb 18, 11.59pm. \n Under the programme, eligible employers can apply for S$100 daily per affected worker and a levy waiver for the duration of the stay-home notice. Affected workers include Singapore citizens, permanent residents and work pass holders who were placed on a stay-home notice upon their return to Singapore. \n Businesses and self-employed Singaporeans and permanent residents will be eligible for the programme if work was not performed remotely by affected workers, and if they were placed on a leave of absence or stay-home notice upon their return to Singapore after: \n Travelling to mainland China on or before Jan 31, or \n Travelling to Daegu city or Cheongdo county in South Korea on or before Feb 26, or \n Travelling to South Korea, Northern Italy, or Iran before March 4, or \n Travelling to Italy, Spain, France or Germany on or before March 15, or \n Traveling to Asean countries, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom on or before March 16 \n \"As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, there may be additional requirements imposed on work pass holders from time to time,\" said MOM. Employers and employees are advised to check the MOM’s website at http://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19 for the latest information. \n ",

The countries subject to the new restrictions are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  \n - Travelers from the United Kingdom, Ireland and more than a dozen Eastern and Southeastern Europe nations will exempted. Those countries do not participate in the Schengen Area's passport-free travel.  \n - The restrictions will not apply to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or to spouses, parents and children under the age of 21 of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, among other exceptions.  \n - Flights from the affected European nations will be funneled to 13 airports in the United States that serve 90 percent of existing European flights, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official. Boston Logan International Airport and Miami International Airport will be added to a list of 11 airports that have been receiving incoming flights from China and Iran since early February.  \n - At the same time, U.S. airports are cutting flights. Delta Air Lines said Friday it plans to suspend all flights to and from continental Europe for 30 days - a suspension that could start as early as Sunday.  \n - The United States is preparing for thousands of new coronavirus cases and will ask Americans returning from the affected European countries to go into self-quarantine for 14 days as part of the effort to contain the outbreak, Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday.  \n - Travelers coming from the targeted European countries will be subjected to enhanced entry screening upon arrival in the United States, DHS said in a statement on Friday. During that screening, they will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and contact information, which will be supplied to local health authorities, according to DHS. They will be given written guidance about COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and told to self-quarantine at home, the agency said.  \n - President Donald Trump's proclamation on Wednesday said the Schengen countries had the highest rate of coronavirus infection outside of China, and that \"the free flow of people between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult.\"  \n - A key question is - What is to stop people from the Schengen region from traveling to the United States via Britain? Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said while Britain maintains entry and exit records for all travelers, it does not regularly share that information with the United States.

In total, the country adds 80.793 infected.\nThe National Health Commission reported that 62.793 people were discharged after having overcome the disease to date and 14.831 remained in treatment.\nTen of the eleven deaths occurred in Hubei Province, an epicentre of the epidemic, where eight of the 15 new cases detected at national level also emerged.\nIn total, Hubei sums up three.056 deaths and 67.781 cases of infection, most of them worldwide.\nIn the last 24-hour period, six \"imported\" cases were detected from outside the country, including three in Guangdong Province, adjacent to Macao.\nMeanwhile, an investigation of the Chinese magazine Caixin reveals that the Chinese hospital where Li Wenliang worked, the first doctor who warned of the dangers of the new coronavirus, was the most affected by the outbreak because it concealed essential information.\nAmong the 4.000 employees working at Wuhan Central Hospital, 230 died from Covid-19 infection, the highest mortality rate among health workers in Wuhan, the Chinese city that is epicenter of the outbreak.\nThe head of one of the departments of the hospital mentioned by Caixin, one of China's rare independent publications, blamed the authorities for putting lives at riskYeah.\n\"The false information released by relevant departments [that the disease was controllable and not infectious among humans] left hundreds of doctors and nurses in the dark, who did everything in their power to treat patients without knowing the disease\", pointed out the person responsible, whose name is not identified by the Caixin.\n\"And even those who fell ill could not report it. They couldn't alert their colleagues and the public in time, despite the sacrifice. That is the most painful loss and lesson,\"he said.\nAccording to the magazine, the hospital had been overwhelmed by fever patients since early January. Several were taken care of doctors who were not specialized in contagious diseases.\nThe doctors cited by the Caixin blamed the administration for \"incompetence\".\nThe head of the Communist Party at the hospital had no knowledge of infectious diseases and forbade doctors from disclosing critical information to public health, he found the magazine.\nAn internal document from the Central Hospital obtained by the Caixin also revealed direct interference by the Wuhan municipal health authorities, which made it difficult for the hospital to disclose cases, especially between the 12th and 17th days of last January, when the local Communist Party cadres took part in the meetings of the local legislative body.\nAccording to Caixin, an official of the Ministry of Public Security visited the hospital on January 12th, and ordered the forms on infectious diseases to be filled in and reported only after consultations with experts at the municipal and provincial level, delaying the process.\nOn January 13th, Wang Wenyong, head of the infectious disease control office of Jianghan district in Wuhan, called the hospital and asked that suspected reports of infection with the new coronavirus, filed in January 10th, be amended to show other diseases in the fileYeah.\nIn response, the hospital asked the district health authorities to collect samples, but they were told to stand by. The wait lasted three days.\nIn January 16, after the meetings of the local legislature were completed, the disease control centre of the city of Wuhan was finally collecting samples.

        "news_content_translate_en": "MILAN/SEOUL - In Italy, millions are locked down and more than 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus. In South Korea, hit by the disease at about the same time, only a few thousand are quarantined and 67 people have died. As the virus courses through the world, the story of two outbreaks illustrates a coming problem for countries now grappling with an explosion in cases.  \n It's impractical to test every potential patient, but unless the authorities can find a way to see how widespread infection is, their best answer is lockdown.  \n Italy started out testing widely, then narrowed the focus so that now, the authorities don't have to process hundreds of thousands of tests. But there's a trade-off: They can't see what's coming and are trying to curb the movements of the country's entire population of 60 million people to contain the disease. Even Pope Francis, who has a cold and delivered his Sunday blessing over the internet from inside the Vatican, said he felt \"caged in the library.\"  \n Thousands of miles away in South Korea, authorities have a different response to a similar-sized outbreak. They are testing hundreds of thousands of people for infections and tracking potential carriers like detectives, using cell phone and satellite technology.  \n Both countries saw their first cases of the disease called COVID-19 in late January. South Korea has since reported 67 deaths out of nearly 8,000 confirmed cases, after testing more than 222,000 people. In contrast, Italy has had 1,016 deaths and identified more than 15,000 cases after carrying out more than 73,000 tests on an unspecified number of people.  \n Epidemiologists say it is not possible to compare the numbers directly. But some say the dramatically different outcomes point to an important insight: Aggressive and sustained testing is a powerful tool for fighting the virus.  \n Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, said extensive testing can give countries a better picture of the extent of an outbreak. When testing in a country is limited, he said, the authorities have to take bolder actions to limit movement of people.  \n \"I'm uncomfortable with enforced lockdown-type movement restrictions,\" he said. \"China did that, but China is able to do that. China has a population that will comply with that.\"  \n The democracies of Italy and South Korea are useful case studies for countries such as America, which have had problems setting up testing systems and are weeks behind on the infection curve. So far, in Japan and the United States particularly, the full scale of the problem is not yet visible. Germany has not experienced significant testing constraints, but Chancellor Angela Merkel warned her people on Wednesday that since 60% to 70% of the populace is likely to be infected, the only option is containment.  \n South Korea, which has a slightly smaller population than Italy at about 50 million people, has around 29,000 people in self-quarantine. It has imposed lockdowns on some facilities and at least one apartment complex hit hardest by outbreaks. But so far no entire regions have been cut off.  \n Seoul says it is building on lessons learned from an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 and working to make as much information available as possible to the public. It has embarked on a massive testing programme, including people who have very mild illness, or perhaps don't even have symptoms, but who may be able to infect others.  \n This includes enforcing a law that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease. The authorities can then make some of this public, so anyone who may have been exposed can get themselves - or their friends and family members - tested.  \n In addition to helping work out who to test, South Korea's data-driven system helps hospitals manage their pipeline of cases. People found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through a smartphone app, or checked regularly in telephone calls, until a hospital bed becomes available. When a bed is available, an ambulance picks the person up and takes the patient to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms. All of this, including hospitalization, is free of charge.  \n South Korea's response is not perfect. While more than 209,000 people have tested negative there, results are still pending on about 18,000 others - an information gap that means there are likely more cases in the pipeline. The rate of newly confirmed cases has dropped since a peak in mid-February, but the system's greatest test may still be ahead as authorities try to track and contain new clusters. South Korea does not have enough protective masks - it has started rationing them - and it is trying to hire more trained staff to process tests and map cases.  \n And the approach comes at the cost of some privacy. South Korea's system is an intrusive mandatory measure that depends on people surrendering what, for many in Europe and America, would be a fundamental right of privacy. Unlike China and the island-state of Singapore, which have used similar methods, South Korea is a large democracy with a population that is quick to protest policies it does not like.  \n \"Disclosing information about patients always comes with privacy infringement issues,\" said Choi Jaewook, a preventive medicine professor at Korea University and a senior official at the Korean Medical Association. Disclosures \"should be strictly limited\" to patients' movements, and \"it shouldn't be about their age, their sex, or their employers.\"  \n Traditional responses such as locking down affected areas and isolating patients can be only modestly effective, and may cause problems in open societies, says South Korea's Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip. In South Korea's experience, he told reporters on Monday, lockdowns mean people participate less in tracing contacts they may have had. \"Such an approach,\" he said, \"is close-minded, coercive, and inflexible.\"  \n  \n ITALY \"AT THE LIMIT\"  \n Italy and South Korea are more than 5,000 miles apart, but there are several similarities when it comes to coronavirus. Both countries' main outbreaks were initially clustered in smaller cities or towns, rather than in a major metropolis - which meant the disease quickly threatened local health services. And both involved doctors who decided to ignore testing guidelines.  \n Italy's epidemic kicked off last month. A local man with flu symptoms was diagnosed after he had told medical staff he had not been to China and discharged himself, said Massimo Lombardo, head of local hospital services in Lodi.  \n The diagnosis was only made after the 38-year-old, whose name has only been given as Mattia, returned to the hospital. Testing guidelines at the time said it was not necessary to test people who had no link to China or other affected areas. But an anaesthetist pushed the protocols and decided to go ahead and test for COVID-19 anyway, Lombardo said. Now, some experts in Italy believe Mattia may have been infected through Germany, rather than China.  \n Decisions about testing hinge partly on what can be done with people who test positive, at a time when the healthcare system is already under stress. In Italy at first, regional authorities tested widely and counted all positive results in the published total, even if people did not have symptoms.  \n Then, a few days after the patient known as Mattia was found to have COVID-19, Italy changed tack, only testing and announcing cases of people with symptoms. The authorities said this was the most effective use of resources: The risk of contagion seemed lower from patients with no symptoms, and limited tests help produce reliable results more quickly. The approach carried risks: People with no symptoms still can be infected and spread the virus.  \n On the other hand, the more you test the more you find, so testing in large numbers can put hospital systems under strain, said Massimo Antonelli, director of intensive care at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. Testing involves elaborate medical processes and follow-up. \"The problem is actively searching for cases,\" he said. \"It means simply the numbers are big.\"  \n Italy has a generally efficient health system, according to international studies. Its universal healthcare receives funding below the European Union average but is comparable with South Korea's, at 8.9% of GDP against 7.3% in South Korea, according to the World Health Organization.  \n Now, that system has been knocked off balance. Staff are being brought into accident and emergency departments, holidays have been cancelled and doctors say they are delaying non-urgent operations to free up intensive care beds.  \n Pier Luigi Viale, head of the infectious disease unit at Sant' Orsola-Malpighi hospital in Bologna, is working around the clock - in three jobs. His hospital is handling multiple coronavirus cases. His doctors are shuttling to other hospitals and clinics in the area to lend their expertise and help out with cases. In addition, his doctors also have to deal with patients with other contagious diseases who are struggling to survive.  \n \"If it drags on for weeks or months we'll need more reinforcements,\" he told Reuters.  \n Last week, the mayor of Castiglione d'Adda, a town of about 5,000 people in Lombardy's \"red zone\" which was the first to be locked down, made an urgent online appeal for help. He said his small town had had to close its hospital and was left with one doctor to treat more than 100 coronavirus patients. Three of the town's four doctors were sick or in self quarantine.  \n \"Doctors and nurses are at the limit,\" said a nurse from the hospital where Mattia was taken in. \"If you have to manage people under artificial respiration you have to be watching them constantly, you can't look after the new cases that come in.\"  \n Studies so far suggest that every positive case of coronavirus can infect two other people, so local authorities in Lombardy have warned that the region's hospitals face a serious crisis if the spread continues - not just for COVID-19 patients but also for others whose treatment has been delayed or disrupted. As the crisis spreads into Italy's less prosperous south, the problems will be magnified.  \n Intensive care facilities face the most intense pressure. They require specialist staff and expensive equipment and are not set up for mass epidemics. In total, Italy has around 5,000 intensive care beds. In the winter months, some of these are already occupied by patients with respiratory problems. Lombardy and Veneto have just over 1,800 intensive care beds between public and private systems, only some of which can be set aside for COVID-19 patients.  \n The government has asked regional authorities to increase the number of intensive care places by 50% and to double the number of beds for respiratory and contagious diseases, while reorganising staff rosters to ensure adequate staffing. Some 5,000 respirators have been acquired for intensive care stations, the first of which are due to arrive on Friday, deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said.  \n The region has already asked nursing institutes to allow students to bring forward their graduation to get more nurses into the system early. Pools of intensive care specialists and anaesthetists are to be set up, including staff from outside the worst affected regions.  \n To add to the burden, hospitals in Italy depend on medical personnel to try to trace the contacts that people who test positive have had with others. One doctor in Bologna, who asked not to be named, said he had spent a 12-hour day tracing people who had been in contact with just one positive patient, to ensure those who next need testing are found.  \n \"You can do that if the number of cases remains two to three,\" the doctor said. \"But if they grow, something has to give. The system will implode if we continue to test everyone actively and then have to do all this.\"  \n  \n \"MAXIMUM POWER\"  \n In South Korea as in Italy, an early case of COVID-19 was identified when a medical officer followed their intuition, rather than the official guidelines, on testing.  \n The country's first case was a 35-year-old Chinese woman who tested positive on Jan. 20. But the largest outbreak was detected after the 31st patient, a 61-year-old woman from South Korea's southeastern city of Daegu, was diagnosed on Feb. 18.  \n Like the patient named Mattia in Italy, the woman had no known links to Wuhan, the Chinese province where the disease was first identified. And as in Italy, the doctors' decision to recommend a test went against guidelines at the time to test people who had been to China or been in contact with a confirmed case, said Korea Medical Association's Choi Jaewook.  \n \"Patient 31,\" as she became known, was a member of a secretive church which Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip said has since linked to 61% of cases. Infections spread beyond the congregation after the funeral of a relative of the church's founder was held at a nearby hospital, and there were several other smaller clusters around the country.  \n Once the church cluster was identified, South Korea opened around 50 drive-through testing facilities around the country.  \n In empty parking lots, medical staff in protective clothing lean into cars to check their passengers for fever or breathing difficulties, and if needed, collect samples. The process usually takes about 10 minutes, and people usually receive the results in a text reminding them to wash their hands regularly and wear face masks.  \n A total of 117 institutions in South Korea have equipment to conduct the tests, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The numbers fluctuate daily, but an average of 12,000 is possible, and maximum capacity is 20,000 tests a day. The government pays for tests of people with symptoms, if referred by a doctor. Otherwise, people who want to be tested can pay up to 170,000 won ($140), said an official at a company called Seegene Inc, which supplies 80% of the country's kits and says it can test 96 samples at once.  \n There are also 130 quarantine officers like Kim Jeong-hwan, who focus on minute details to track potential patients. The 28-year-old public health doctor spends his whole working days remotely checking up on people who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.  \n Kim, who is doing military service, is one of a small army of quarantine officers who track the movements of any potential carriers of the disease by phone, app or the signals sent by cell phones or the black boxes in automobiles. Their goal: To trace all the contacts people may have had, so they too can be tested.  \n \"I haven't seen anyone telling bad lies,\" Kim said. \"But lots of people generally don't remember exactly what they did.\"  \n Underlining their determination, quarantine officers told Reuters they located five cases after a worker in a small town caught the virus and went to work in a \"coin karaoke,\" a bar where a machine lets people sing a few songs for a dollar. At first, the woman, who was showing symptoms, did not tell the officers where she worked, local officials told Reuters. But they put the puzzle together after questioning her acquaintances and obtaining GPS locations on her mobile device.  \n \"Now, quarantine officers have maximum power and authority,\" said Kim Jun-geun, an official at Changnyeong County who collects information from quarantine officers.  \n South Korea's government also uses location data to customize mass messages sent to cellphones, notifying every resident when and where a nearby case is confirmed.  \n Lee Hee-young, a preventative medicine expert who is also running the coronavirus response team in South Korea's Gyeonggi province, said South Korea has gone some of the way after MERS to increase its infrastructure to respond to infectious diseases. But she said only 30% of the changes the country needs have happened. For instance, she said, maintaining a trained workforce and up-to-date infrastructure at smaller hospitals isn't easy.  \n \"Until we fix this,\" Lee said, \"explosions like this can keep blowing up anywhere.\" REUTERS \n ",

konndyk）表示，广泛的检测可以让各国更好地了解疫情的程度。他说，当一个国家的测试受到限制时，当局必须采取更大胆的行动限制人员流动。\n他说：“我对强制的封锁式的行动限制感到不安。”中国做到了，但中国能够做到。中国有很多人会遵守这一规定。”\n意大利和韩国的民主国家是美国等国家有用的案例研究，这些国家在建立检测系统方面遇到了问题，而且在感染曲线上落后了数周。到目前为止，特别是在日本和美国，问题的全面性还不明显。德国没有经历重大的测试限制，但总理默克尔周三警告她的人民，由于60%到70%的民众可能受到感染，唯一的选择是遏制。\n韩国人口比意大利略少，约5000万人，约有2.9万人处于自我隔离状态。它已经对一些设施和至少一个受疫情影响最严重的公寓大楼实施了封锁。但到目前为止，还没有一个地区被切断。\n首尔说，它正在吸取2015年爆发的中东呼吸综合征（MERS）的教训，努力向公众提供尽可能多的信息。它已经开始了一个大规模的测试项目，包括那些有非常轻微的疾病，或者甚至没有症状，但可能会感染其他人的人。\n这包括执行一项法律，授予政府访问数据的权限：闭路电视录像、来自电话和汽车的GPS跟踪数据、信用卡交易、移民入境信息以及其他被证实患有传染病的人的个人详细信息. 当局可以公开其中的一些内容，这样任何可能被曝光的人都可以对自己或者他们的朋友和家人进行检测。\n韩国的数据驱动系统除了帮助确定测试对象外，还帮助医院管理他们的病例管道。被发现呈阳性的人会被置于自我隔离状态，并通过智能手机应用程序进行远程监控，或者定期通过电话进行检查，直到有一张病床可用。当有床位时，救护车会将病人抬起来，并将病人送往一家有气密隔离室的医院。所有这些，包括住院治疗，都是免费的。\n韩国的反应并不完美。虽然有超过20.9万人的检测结果呈阴性，但仍有约1.8万人的检测结果悬而未决——这是一个信息鸿沟，意味着可能还有更多的病例在酝酿中。自2月中旬出现高峰以来，新确诊病例率有所下降，但随着当局试图追踪和遏制新的病例群，该系统最大的考验可能仍在前方。韩国没有足够的防护口罩——它已经开始定量配给口罩——它正试图雇佣更多训练有素的工作人员来处理检测和地图案件。\n而这种方法是以牺牲一些隐私为代价的。韩国的这项制度是一项侵入性的强制性措施，它取决于人们放弃对欧美许多人来说是基本隐私权的东西。与中国和岛国新加坡使用类似方法不同，韩国是一个庞大的民主国家，其人口很快就会抗议自己不喜欢的政策。\n韩国大学预防医学教授、韩国医学会高级官员崔再武（音译）说：“披露病人的信息总是伴随着侵犯隐私的问题。”。披露“应严格限制”患者的活动，“不应与患者的年龄、性别或雇主有关”.\"\n韩国卫生福利部副部长金刚利（Kim Gang lip）表示，封锁疫区、隔离病人等传统应对措施只能起到适度的效果，而且可能会在开放的社会中造成问题。根据韩国的经验，他周一对记者说，封锁意味着人们参与追查可能有过联系的人减少了。”他说，这样的做法“思想严密、强迫性强、缺乏灵活性”\n意大利“处于极限”\n意大利和韩国相距5000多英里，但在冠状病毒方面有几个相似之处。这两个国家的主要疫情最初集中在较小的城市或城镇，而不是在一个大城市，这意味着该疾病很快威胁到当地的卫生服务。这两个案例都涉及那些决定忽略检测指南的医生。\n意大利的流行病上个月开始流行。洛迪当地医院服务部门负责人马西莫隆巴多（Massimo Lombardo）说，一名有流感症状的当地男子在告诉医务人员他没有去过中国并自行出院后被确诊。\n这一诊断是在38岁的马蒂亚回到医院后才作出的。当时的检测指南说，没有必要对与中国或其他受影响地区没有联系的人进行检测。但伦巴多说，一名麻醉师推动了这些方案，决定继续进行COVID-19的检测。现在，意大利的一些专家认为，马蒂亚可能是通过德国而不是中国感染的。\n在医疗系统已经处于压力之下的时候，关于测试的决定部分取决于那些测试呈阳性的人能做些什么。在意大利，一开始，地方当局进行了广泛的检测，并将所有阳性结果都计算在公布的总数中，即使人们没有症状。\n然后，在被称为马蒂亚的病人被发现患有COVID-19的几天后，意大利改变了策略，只对有症状的人进行了检测并公布了病例. 当局说，这是最有效的资源利用：没有症状的病人感染的风险似乎更低，有限的检查有助于更快地产生可靠的结果。这种方法有风险：没有症状的人仍然可能被感染并传播病毒。\n另一方面，你测试的越多，你发现的就越多，因此大量的测试会使医院系统处于紧张状态，罗马Fondazione Polilinico University Itario Agostino Gemelli IRCC的重症监护主任Massimo Antonelli说。检测包括详细的医疗流程和后续行动。”“问题是积极寻找案件，”他说这只意味着数字很大。”\n根据国际研究，意大利有一个普遍有效的卫生系统。世界卫生组织（who）的数据显示，韩国的全民医疗基金低于欧盟平均水平，但与韩国相当，仅占GDP的8.9%，而韩国为7.3%。\n现在，这个系统已经失去了平衡。工作人员被带进了事故和紧急部门，假期被取消，医生说他们推迟了非紧急手术来腾出重症监护床。\n博洛尼亚圣奥索拉·马尔皮吉医院传染病科主任皮尔·路易吉·维亚莱（Pier Luigi Viale）正在做三份24小时工作。他的医院正在处理多个冠状病毒病例。他的医生们正穿梭于这一地区的其他医院和诊所，以提供他们的专业知识和帮助处理病例。此外，他的医生还必须处理其他传染病患者谁是挣扎生存。\n他对路透表示：“如果事态持续数周或数月，我们将需要更多增援。”。\n上周，在伦巴第第一个被封锁的“红色地带”大约5000人的城镇卡斯蒂利亚内达达（Castiglione d'Adda）的市长在网上紧急求助. 他说，他的小镇不得不关闭医院，只剩下一名医生治疗100多名冠状病毒患者。镇上的四名医生中有三人生病或处于自我隔离状态。\n“医生和护士已经到了极限，”马蒂亚被收留的医院的一名护士说如果你必须在人工呼吸下管理人员，你必须不断地观察他们，你就不能照看新来的病例。”\n迄今为止的研究表明，每一例阳性的冠状病毒病例都可能感染另外两人，因此伦巴第地方当局警告说，如果病毒继续传播，该地区的医院将面临严重危机——不仅是COVID-19患者，还有其他治疗被推迟或中断的患者。随着危机蔓延到意大利不太繁荣的南部，问题将被放大。\n重症监护机构面临的压力最大。它们需要专业人员和昂贵的设备，不适合大规模流行病。意大利总共有大约5000张重症监护床。在冬季，其中一些已经被呼吸系统疾病患者占据。伦巴第和维尼托在公共和私人系统之间只有1800多张重症监护床，其中只有一部分可以留给19名COVID患者。\n政府已要求地区当局增加50%的重症监护室，并将呼吸系统疾病和传染病的病床增加一倍，同时重新组织工作人员名册，以确保有足够的工作人员。经济部副部长劳拉·卡斯泰利说，已经为重症监护室购买了大约5000个呼吸器，其中第一个将于周五抵达。\n该地区已经要求护理学院允许学生提前毕业，以便让更多的护士尽早进入该系统。将建立一批重症监护专家和麻醉师，包括来自受影响最严重地区以外的工作人员.\n为了增加负担，意大利的医院依靠医务人员来追踪检测呈阳性的人与他人的接触情况。博洛尼亚一位不愿透露姓名的医生说，他花了12个小时每天追踪那些只接触过一名阳性患者的人，以确保找到那些下一个需要检测的人。\n“如果病例数保持在2到3个，你就可以这样做，”医生说但如果他们长大了，就得付出点什么。如果我们继续主动测试每个人，然后不得不这么做，系统就会崩溃。”\n“最大功率”\n在韩国和意大利，COVID-19的早期病例是在一名医务人员遵循他们的直觉，而不是官方的检测指南时发现的。\n中国的第一个病例是一名35岁的中国妇女，她在1月20日检测呈阳性。但在2月18日，韩国东南部城市大邱的一名61岁妇女被确诊为第31名患者后，发现了最大的疫情。\n与意大利一位名叫马蒂亚的病人一样，这名妇女与武汉没有已知的联系，武汉是中国首次发现这种疾病的省份。韩国医学会的崔杰伍克说，和意大利一样，医生们建议进行检查的决定违反了当时对去过中国或接触过确诊病例的人进行检查的指导方针。\n据她所知，“31号病人”是一个秘密教会的成员，卫生和福利部副部长金刚利（Kim Gang lip）说，这一教会后来与61%的病例有关。在教堂创始人的一位亲属的葬礼在附近的医院举行之后，感染蔓延到会众之外，全国还有其他几个较小的群体。\n一旦教堂群被确定，韩国在全国开设了大约50个驾车测试设施.\n在空荡荡的停车场，身穿防护服的医务人员靠在车里检查乘客是否发烧或呼吸困难，必要时采集样本。这个过程通常需要10分钟左右，人们通常会收到一条短信，提醒他们定期洗手和戴口罩。\n据韩国疾病预防控制中心（KCDC）称，韩国共有117家机构拥有进行检测的设备。这些数字每天都有波动，但平均可能达到12000次，最大容量为每天20000次测试。如果有医生推荐，政府会为有症状的人的检查付费。另外，一家名为Seegene Inc.的公司的一位官员说，想接受检测的人最多可以支付17万韩元（140美元），该公司提供了该国80%的药箱，并说它可以一次检测96个样本。\n还有130名像金正焕这样的检疫官员，他们专注于微小的细节来追踪潜在的病人。这位28岁的公共卫生医生花了他整个工作日的时间远程检查那些被检测出COVID-19阳性的人，COVID-19是由病毒引起的疾病。\n正在服兵役的金正恩是一支由检疫官员组成的小分队之一，他们通过电话、应用程序或手机或汽车黑匣子发出的信号追踪任何可能携带这种疾病的人的行踪。他们的目标是：追踪人们可能接触过的所有人，这样他们也可以被测试。\n“我没见过有人说谎，”金说但很多人通常不记得自己到底做了什么。”\n为了强调他们的决心，检疫官员告诉路透社说，他们发现了5起病例，因为一个小镇的一名工人染上了病毒，去了一家“投币卡拉OK”酒吧工作，一台机器可以让人们用一美元唱几首歌。当地官员告诉路透社记者，起初，这名出现症状的妇女没有告诉警察她在哪里工作. 但在询问了她的熟人并在她的移动设备上获取了GPS位置后，他们把这个谜团拼凑了起来。\n“现在，检疫官员拥有最大的权力和权威，”从检疫官员那里收集信息的长荣县官员金俊根说。\n韩国政府还利用位置数据定制发送到手机上的大量信息，在确认附近病例的时间和地点通知每位居民。\n韩国京畿道冠状病毒应对小组的预防医学专家李熙英（Lee Hee young）表示，韩国在MERS之后采取了一些措施，增加应对传染病的基础设施。但她说，这个国家所需要的变革只有30%发生了。例如，她说，在小型医院维持训练有素的员工队伍和最新的基础设施并不容易。\n“在我们解决这个问题之前，”李说，“像这样的爆炸会在任何地方继续爆炸。”",

        "news_content_translate_en": "When the severe acute respiratory (Sars) epidemic ended in 2003, many people in China thought that the government had learned its lesson. \n Sars was the most serious epidemic the country encountered in the reform era, killing 349 people in China. \n The government was roundly criticised for its cover-ups in the early phases of the epidemic, leading to some frantic bureaucratic reshuffles, greater transparency and an expensive control and prevention system for infectious diseases. \n In March 2019, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Gao Fu confidently predicted that China would never again suffer from another Sars-like epidemic. \n Mr Gao is facing a storm of anger for this prediction since the outbreak in December 2019 of new coronavirus Covid-19, which has caused infections and deaths than Sars. \n As of March 7, according to the World Health Organization, Covid-19 has caused 3,073 deaths and infected 80,813 people in China, with hundreds of thousands more under medical observation. \n A medical and humanitarian tragedy has wreaked havoc in Wuhan city and Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic. \n A widely circulated social-media article describes 11 striking mistakes China has repeated this time around. \n The most grievous failings are the government cover-ups and censorship in the early phases of the epidemic which cost the country a precious three weeks in January to fight the virus. \n The most notorious cover-up surrounded Dr Li Wenliang, the now renowned whistle-blower who drew attention to early cases of Covid-19 infection. \n The police admonished him for warning people about the virus on social media and he later died from the infection himself. \n As news of his death began to circulate online on the evening of Feb 6 Feb, there was an outpouring of mourning and anger — too much for the censors to manage. \n Dr Li is already a martyr in the eyes of his mourners. But will the present crisis tragically embodied by his death spur China to learn any real lessons? \n Leaning from history is one of the most difficult skills for humankind to master. \n German philosopher Hegel once cynically remarked that “the only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history”. \n Twentieth-century American philosopher George Santayana offered a dark warning that “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”. \n The value of historical learning is just as venerated in the Chinese tradition. The great 11th-century classic work of Chinese historiography Comprehensive Mirror to Aid Governance by Zi Zhi Tong Jian trawls the entirety of Chinese history up to that point for lessons in politics and governance. \n Courageous Chinese intellectuals are signing online letters calling for the authorities to respect freedom of speech, supposedly guaranteed by the country’s constitution. \n They believe that if freedom of speech as an individual right were protected, voices like Dr Li’s would have been heard more widely and effectively, perhaps forestalling the spread. If Dr Li’s death led to real freedom of speech in China, that would be a lesson well learned. \n But there is no sign as yet of such learning taking place. No sooner had demands for freedom of expression gained traction than they too fell victim to censors. \n Information control is hardening, not loosening. Truthful depictions of the tolls of the crisis in Wuhan are condemned as rumours and swiftly deleted. \n This happened to Fang Fang, a resident of Wuhan and professional writer whose first-hand blogs of the humanitarian disaster unfolding in her city have gripped millions of readers. \n The length to which the censors have gone to eliminate dissent is extraordinary. On Feb 22, authorities killed an article run by the official Xinhua News Agency for its assertion that “the sky is not going to fall upon the telling of truth”. \n A more promising avenue for learning is governance reform. This is where most Chinese discussions on managing the epidemic are centred. \n Various experts are weighing in on the need for institutional reform. Unlike Western commentaries which tend to blame the authoritarian system of President Xi Jinping, Chinese scholars raise a multitude of questions beyond politics. \n These include concerns about state–society relations, centre–local relations and the role of social organisations (including non-governmental organisations) and professional groups. \n While the rigidity of the Chinese system and the consequent governance failure are part of their criticisms, their comments are more nuanced and fine-tuned. \n Some of these views may reach the very top of the Chinese system, but it is unclear how the leadership will learn from this crisis. \n There are likely to be plenty of technical fixes, such as those recently announced by President Xi. \n But will the learning be so deep as to inaugurate systemic governance reforms and ensure long-term progress? \n As China continues its fight against Covid-19, the best hope is that the country can learn real lessons from this crisis and prove Hegel wrong.

        "news_content_translate_cn": "2003年非典疫情结束时，许多中国人认为政府吸取了教训。\n非典是中国在改革时期遇到的最严重的流行病，在中国造成349人死亡。\n政府在传染病爆发初期的掩盖行为受到了严厉的批评，导致了一些疯狂的官僚机构重组、更大的透明度以及昂贵的传染病控制和预防体系。\n2019年3月，中国疾病预防控制中心主任高富自信地预测，中国再也不会出现类似非典的疫情。\n自2019年12月爆发新冠状病毒Covid-19以来，高晓松面临着一场愤怒的风暴，该病毒已造成比Sars更严重的感染和死亡。\n据世界卫生组织统计，截至3月7日，Covid-19在中国已造成3073人死亡，80813人感染，另有数十万人在接受医学观察。\n一场医疗和人道主义悲剧在疫情中心武汉市和湖北省造成严重破坏。\n一篇广为流传的社交媒体文章描述了中国这次重蹈覆辙的11个惊人错误。\n最严重的失误是政府在疫情初期的掩盖和审查，这使该国在1月份损失了宝贵的三周时间来抗击病毒。\n最臭名昭著的掩盖行动包围了李文良医生，这位现在著名的告密者引起了人们对早期Covid-19感染病例的关注。\n警方告诫他在社交媒体上警告人们有关病毒的信息，他后来自己也死于感染。\n2月6日晚，当他去世的消息开始在网上流传时，人们纷纷表示哀悼和愤怒——审查人员无法应付。\n在哀悼者眼中，李博士已经是烈士了. 但是，他死后悲剧地体现的当前危机是否会促使中国吸取任何真正的教训？\n历史学习是人类最难掌握的技能之一。\n德国哲学家黑格尔曾冷嘲热讽地说：“我们从历史中学到的唯一东西就是我们从历史中学不到任何东西。”。\n20世纪美国哲学家乔治·桑塔亚纳提出了一个黑暗的警告：“那些不记得过去的人注定要重蹈覆辙”。\n历史学习的价值在中国传统中同样受到尊重。《资治通鉴》是11世纪中国史学史上的一部伟大经典著作，它全面反映了中国历史，为政治和治理提供了经验教训。\n勇敢的中国知识分子在网上签名，呼吁当局尊重言论自由，据说这是由中国宪法保障的。\n他们认为，如果言论自由作为一项个人权利得到保护，像李博士这样的声音会被更广泛、更有效地听到，或许会阻止传播。如果李博士的死导致了中国真正的言论自由，那将是一个很好的教训。\n但目前还没有迹象表明这种学习正在发生。言论自由的要求一得到重视，他们就成了审查者的牺牲品。\n信息控制是硬的，不是松的。如实描述武汉市的交通事故收费标准被视为谣言予以谴责，并迅速删除。\n这件事发生在武汉市民、专业作家方芳身上，她在自己的博客中第一手记录了武汉发生的人道主义灾难，吸引了数百万读者。\n审查人员消除异议的时间之长非同寻常。2月22日，官方新华社发表了一篇文章，声称“说真话，天不会塌下来”，官方对此予以了否认.\n一个更有前途的学习途径是治理改革。这是大多数中国人关于控制疫情的讨论的中心。\n各种专家都在权衡机构改革的必要性。与西方批评往往归咎于习近平主席的专制制度不同，中国学者在政治之外提出了许多问题。\n其中包括对国家与社会关系、中心与地方关系以及社会组织（包括非政府组织）和专业团体的作用的关注。\n尽管中国体制的僵化和随之而来的治理失败是他们批评的一部分，但他们的评论更为微妙和精细。\n其中一些观点可能触及中国体制的最高层，但尚不清楚中国领导人将如何从这场危机中吸取教训。\n可能会有很多技术上的修正，比如习主席最近宣布的那些。\n但是，这种学习是否会如此深入，以至于启动系统性的治理改革，确保长期进展？\n在中国继续与Covid-19作战之际，最大的希望是中国能从这场危机中吸取真正的教训，证明黑格尔是错的。东亚论坛\n \n关于作者：\n冯章是广州华南理工大学国际关系学教授、公共政策研究所执行院长。",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — There are now 17 confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections from the latest cluster involving a private function at Safra Jurong, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (March 6). \n Of these, nine cases were among the 13 new Covid-19 infections that were reported on Friday — the highest number of cases reported in a day so far. \n HOW MANY PEOPLE ATTENDED THE EVENT? \n Speaking to reporters, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, director of medical services at MOH, said that the authorities do not yet know the exact number of guests who were present at the dinner function on Feb 15. \n In a statement on Thursday, Safra said that the event was held at the Joy Garden Restaurant on its premises, which was then closed for cleaning from Feb 16 to 19. All visitors had their temperatures checked and were required to make declarations about their recent travel history, it added. \n “They did not have fever or exhibited any flu-like symptoms. They also did not have any recent travel history to mainland China within the past 14 days of their visit to the club as stated within their declaration,” Safra said. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that investigations are ongoing to assess how many people attended the dinner and which people might have had close contact with individuals who the authorities now know to have infections. \n WHAT KIND OF EVENT WAS IT?  \n Associate Professor Vernon Lee, director of communicable diseases at MOH, said that the private event was a sit-down dinner and a social event organised by a couple of individuals for friends and their other family members. \n Assoc Prof Mak said that people were seated at more than one table, and they were moving around the private function room throughout the dinner. \n WHY DID IT TAKE A WHILE TO FIND LINKS? \n Not all of the 17 confirmed cases from the cluster at Safra Jurong attended the private dinner function, Assoc Prof Mak said. Some of the infected people linked to the cluster were not present, but were family members of those who had attended the function. \n It took “some time” to establish how the infected people in the cluster were linked, he said. \n This came only after extensive recording, investigations of the movements of the infected people and contact tracing. Then the authorities were able to identify the activity that the confirmed cases had in common — that is, the private function at Safra Jurong. \n Assoc Prof Mak added that the authorities had to interview these individuals, trying to find out what their movements were, assessing who they had come into contact with and then interviewing those other people as well. \n “That takes time. And this explains why it is taking so long to establish the various people involved, to also make a diagnosis on these individuals as well,” he said, adding that contact tracing and investigations are continuing. \n Assoc Prof Mak warned that there is a possibility that more cases linked to this cluster will emerge over the next few days. \n WHY ARE SOME CASES ONLY EMERGING NOW? \n A number of cases from the Safra Jurong cluster presented themselves to the authorities “days after they were symptomatic”, Assoc Prof Mak said. \n Some of the infected people continued with social activities and went to work despite having respiratory symptoms, he added. \n “We’ve always been telling members of the public that if you are sick, please don’t mix around, (don’t) continue with your social activities (or) work activities. If you are sick, see a doctor early and isolate.”  \n When people do not heed the call to not go out to gatherings when they have flu-symptoms or are sick, it makes it harder to contain the disease and \"exposes other people who otherwise would have been well to the Covid-19 infection\", he said. \n \"And this thus makes our task even more challenging in trying to identify who the close contacts might be, and then isolating them and putting them on surveillance.” \n Assoc Prof Lee emphasised the same point: “It is all a cluster, as a result of someone symptomatic who went for the event. \n “So, as long as people adhere to these social responsibilities and don’t go around when they are ill, then we can see that this entire incident would not have happened.” \n Asked what had been done to the identified attendees at the private function, Assoc Prof Lee explained that it had been more than 14 days since the event took place, so only those who reported that they were unwell had to go to the hospital for checks. \n “Those who were well throughout would not have been quarantined because they had already passed that 14-day exposure period,” he said. \n WHO ELSE ARE LINKED TO THE CLUSTER? \n Aside from the nine newly confirmed cases on Friday, eight other cases reported previously have been linked to the cluster at Safra Jurong. \n They are: Case 96, a Year 1 Raffles Institution student, who is linked to Case 94, a 64-year-old Singaporean woman who is then linked to Case 112, an assistant cook at Creative O Preschoolers’ Bay. None of the cases has recently travelled to China, or Daegu city or Cheongdo county in South Korea. \n Case 107, a 68-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Jakarta, Indonesia from Feb 11 to 14, while Case 117, a 52-year-old Singaporean woman, was in Malaysia on March 1. \n Other cases linked to the Safra Jurong cluster are Cases 114, 115 and 116 who were confirmed on Thursday. \n WHAT PRECAUTIONS DID SAFRA JURONG TAKE?  \n In a statement on its website on Thursday, Safra said that the individuals who had attended the private dinner function and who then tested positive for Covid-19 had cleared mandatory temperature checks it had conducted. \n It said that all visitors and employees at Safra Jurong had undergone temperature checks which had been introduced in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, along with other measures such as increased cleaning and disinfection of facilities. \n All visitors have to make declarations about their travel history and to provide contact details, the statement added. \n In a Facebook post early on Friday, Safra said that the restaurant, along with all other possible areas which might have been visited by the affected individuals, was to be “thoroughly cleaned and disinfected again starting (March 6)”. \n In a separate Facebook post, Safra Jurong said that the restaurant will be closed from March 6 to 12. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — To ensure that Singapore residents continue to observe good public and personal hygiene even beyond the Covid-19 outbreak, the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) on Friday (March 6) announced a new SG Clean Taskforce.  \n The taskforce will introduce mandatory cleaning standards from 2021, at places such as preschools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres. It will also encourage the public to adopt personal hygiene practices among other measures.  \n It will build on the work from the SG Clean campaign announced last month, which introduced a cleanliness indicator that has been rolled out at hawker centres and coffee shops nationwide. \n Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said at a press conference on Friday that raised hygiene standards will have to be our “new norms”, and that decontamination of the environment is “a common and shared responsibility”.  \n \"This is the best way forward because this is how we can carry on with our lives while making some adjustments... What we know now is that from our research… is that the environment contamination is an important factor in the transmission of the virus, but we also found that it is easily decontaminated,” he said.  \n The announcement of the new taskforce comes a day after Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that Singapore “must expect to see significantly higher numbers\" of new Covid-19 cases in time to come.  \n Speaking in Parliament during the Ministry of Health's (MOH) Committee of Supply debate, Mr Gan said that as the number of cases outside mainland China continues to grow at an “alarming rate”, that Singapore has to adopt a Whole-of-Government approach and mobilise the resources of all the relevant agencies to mount a swift and effective response. \n MANDATORY CLEANING STANDARDS \n Amendments to the Environmental Public Health Act will be made later this year to introduce mandatory cleaning standards. This will include, for example, details on the frequency at which high-contact areas such as public toilets are cleaned and disinfected.  \n In addition, greater accountability will be placed on-premise managers for the cleanliness of their premises. They will be required to submit and implement an environmental sanitation programme and ensure that cleanliness issues on their premises are resolved.  \n They will also need to appoint a trained “designated person” to assist them to develop and enforce the environmental sanitation programme.  \n The National Environment Agency will also work with sectoral leads to “progressively implement” the new requirements from 2021, starting with higher-risk premises such as preschools, schools, eldercare facilities and hawker centres.  \n “The Government will put standards in place and take enforcement action when it is not met,” Mr Zulkifli added.  \n ADJUSTING SOCIAL NORMS  The SG Clean Taskforce will also introduce measures to adjust social norms, by encouraging the use of serving spoons when sharing food and keeping tables clean, among other behaviours. \n It will also be encouraging the “7 habits of good public hygiene”, which includes washing hands and the daily taking of temperature to reduce the risks of spreading diseases.  \n Minister of National Development Lawrence Wong speaking at the press conference said that while improving public hygiene is the “easiest to tackle”, it is personal hygiene and social norms that are “a bit more difficult”.  \n “That is why we need everyone to step up… The good news is that we do see habits already changing.”  \n The SG Clean Taskforce, which was announced on Friday, builds on the SG Clean campaign launched on Feb 16.  \n One component of the campaign is a cleanliness indicator called the “SG Clean quality mark” which is awarded to premises such as hawker stalls and coffee shops that “commit to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists”.  \n To date, 1,907 hawker and market stalls, and 345 coffee shop stalls, as well as 13 hawker centres and 49 coffee shops have been awarded the SG Clean quality mark. \n Said Mr Wong: “Increasingly, social efforts become an important line of our defence, what we do within Singapore.” \n “That is why this SG Clean campaign is vital to Singapore… They seem simple but they really seem to have an effective way of slowing down the virus.”  \n In a Facebook post on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also wrote about the importance of hygiene and cleanliness. \n \"More and more people are getting infected all over the world. Singapore has restricted travellers from badly hit countries, but we can’t close our borders completely. So we must expect more cases and clusters to pop up in Singapore,\" he wrote.  \n He said while Singapore has been quite successful in identifying patients, tracing contacts and stamping out clusters, we also need to slow the spread of the virus and that means raising hygiene standards. \n \"Better hygiene must be our first line of defence,\" he wrote.  \n   \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON/TOKY0 - As the new coronavirus spreads in South Korea, Europe and the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move to try to prevent a global recession with the virus taking a heavy toll on air travel, tourism and other industries.  \n Despite the Fed's attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, U.S. stock indexes were down more than 3%, safe-haven gold rose 3% and analysts and investors are questioning if the rate cut will be enough in the long run if the virus continues to spread.  \n In Iran, doctors and nurses lack supplies and 77 people have died, the highest number outside China. The United Arab Emirates announced it was closing all schools for four weeks.  \n The death toll in Italy, Europe's worst-affected country, jumped to 79 on Tuesday and Italian officials are considering expanding the area under quarantine. France reported its fourth coronavirus death and Iceland, Indonesia, Ukraine and Argentina reported their first coronavirus cases, taking the global total to around 80 countries.  \n About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu's fatality rate of under 1%, but the novel coronavirus can be contained, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.  \n \"To summarise, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained,\" World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.  \n Health officials have said the death rate may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease.  \n The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.  \n There are almost 91,000 cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China.  \n China's death toll was 2,943, with more than 125 fatalities elsewhere.  \n In a unanimous decision, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. U.S. President Donald Trump said a half point cut was not enough.  \n Finance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth.  \n  \n AGGRESSIVE CONTAINMENT  \n China - where new coronavirus cases have been falling sharply and the 129 cases in the last 24 hours was the lowest number reported since Jan. 20 - is increasingly concerned about the virus being brought back into the country by citizens returning from new hotspots elsewhere.  \n Travellers entering Beijing from South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy would have to be quarantined for 14 days, a city official said. Shanghai has introduced a similar order.  \n The worst outbreak outside China is in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in declared war on the virus, ordering additional hospital beds and more masks as cases rose by 600 to nearly 5,000, with 34 deaths.  \n WHO officials also expressed concerns about the situation in Iran, saying doctors lacked respirators and ventilators needed for patients with severe case of the respiratory illness.  \n WHO emergency programme head Michael Ryan said the need in Iran was \"more acute\" than for other countries.  \n While the case numbers in Iran appear to be bad, he said, \"things tend to look worse before getting better.\"  \n The International Olympic Committee on Tuesday said the summer games in Tokyo set to begin on July 24 were still expected to happen despite Japan having nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths.  \n In the United States, there are now 108 people in 12 states with the coronavirus and six deaths in the Seattle area.  \n New York state reported its second case, a man in his 50s who works in Manhattan and has been hospitalized.  \n The public transportation agency in New York, the most densely populated major U.S. city of more than 8 million, said on Twitter it was deploying \"enhanced sanitising procedures\" for stations, train cars, buses and certain vehicles.  \n  \n (GRAPHIC: Tracking the novel coronavirus - https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html) REUTERS \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — All new visitors who have travelled to Iran, northern Italy or South Korea within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter or transit through Singapore from 11.59pm on Wednesday (March 4), the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday. This comes at a time when the number of Covid-19 cases has been spreading further and increasing globally. \n Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders with a travel history to these places within the last 14 days will be issued with a stay-home notice. Long-term pass holders include those holding work passes, student’s passes, dependant’s and long-term visit passes. \n The stay-home notice compels them to not leave home for a 14-day period after their return to Singapore.  \n Correspondingly, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Tuesday it will require all work pass holders — regardless of their nationality and including dependants — with travel history to these places within the last 14 days and planning to enter or return to Singapore, to obtain the ministry’s approval before they commence their journey.  \n The requirement applies to existing work pass holders currently out of Singapore, and in-principle approval holders who have yet to enter Singapore.  \n In addition, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will not issue all forms of new visas to those with Iranian passports with immediate effect, MOH said. \n Those holding Iranian passports who were also issued short-term and multiple-visit visas will have these visas suspended and will not be allowed to enter Singapore. \n Singaporeans are advised to defer non-essential travel to Japan, Iran, northern Italy and South Korea. \n The expanded travel restrictions add to the restrictions already imposed on travellers from mainland China, and come as Iran, Italy and South Korea face mounting Covid-19 crises. \n As of noon on March 3, there were 90,689 confirmed cases of Covid-19 globally, including 10,538 cases outside of China. South Korea has reported 4,812 confirmed cases so far. Italy has 1,835 cases, while Iran has 1,501. \n Japan, which is not affected by the enhanced travel measures, has confirmed 268 cases so far, MOH said. \n National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who chairs the multi-ministry taskforce for Covid-19, said that Japan is not included in the incoming restrictions because its number of confirmed cases is lower than the other countries at this stage. \n “For Japan, we are managing the risk by having an advisory on outgoing trips at this juncture,” Mr Wong told reporters on Tuesday. \n MOH said that the extra precautions will help reduce the risk of imported cases, but the coronavirus is still spreading quickly around the world. \n “In the days ahead, it is likely that we will see a surge of infected cases in countries around the world, including in America, Europe, the Middle East and the rest of Asia. Singapore is a small, globally connected city-state and we are faced with a higher risk of imported cases,” it said in its statement. \n “There are likely to be many undetected cases in countries that are not undertaking proactive testing,” it added, without naming any countries. \n “Increasingly, it will not be possible to stop the virus at our borders. We also cannot isolate Singapore and shut ourselves from the world. Despite our best efforts, we have to be prepared for new spikes in Covid-19 cases in Singapore, as has happened elsewhere.”  \n Mr Wong explained that border control measures are still useful at this stage “because we can still identify where the sources of risks are and then we can take appropriate measures to reduce the risk” of imported cases of Covid-19. \n “By doing so, we (can) flatten the epidemic curve in Singapore. We buy ourselves time and we avoid a situation where our hospitals get overwhelmed by a sudden surge of cases,” he said. \n However, Singapore may come to a point where travel restrictions and border controls alone will no longer be enough once the coronavirus spreads to nearby countries, he added. \n “It will depend on how widely the virus spreads in other countries. It's our assessment of how endemic it becomes around the world. And at that juncture, I think some of these restrictions may become less relevant,” Mr Wong said. \n Urging Singaporeans to continue practising good personal hygiene, MOH said that it will redouble its efforts and continue put resources into detecting and isolating Covid-19 cases as well as close contacts to “break the chain of infection”. \n MOH said that Singaporeans should adopt the following practices: \n Stay home when unwell, including during the period covered by medical certificates \n Wash hands regularly with soap and water, and not touching the face unnecessarily \n Clean up after themselves at hawker centres and not sharing utensils. \n “These need to be a part of our daily life permanently. Such habits will enable us to resist infections like Covid-19, while going about our daily lives normally as much as possible,” the ministry said. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "The Chinese coronavirus caused a fellowship collapse in February on a global scale that gave an estimated EUR 6,9 billion (7,6 billion dollars) break in world capitalisation. The sum of the GDP of Germany, France and Spain.\nThe new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan in China and has already entered the gallery of black swans, the metaphor created by Nassim Taleb for unexpected events with disruptive consequences on financial markets and the economy. Ironic of chance, the black swan derived from the new coronavirus (which is associated with the disease called Covid-10) would have originated from a large horseshoe bat marketed on the market for live animals in that Chinese city.\nAfter a fall in January 1,2%, the worldwide index MSCI sank 8,2% in February, according to data released this weekend by the financial analysis company MSCI (ex-Morgan Stanley Capital International). A much larger fall than the last two bumps on the fellowships in May and August of 2018. The world index covers 23 developed markets (among them the Lisbon stock exchange) and 26 emerging ones (including the two Chinese stock exchanges).\nWorld capitalization was around the 93 billion dollars in late January, taking into account the World Federation of Exchanges data, which covers all the pockets on the planet.\nWith the February crash, world capitalization fell to near the figures of September last year.\nThe region with the biggest drop in percentage in February was the euro zone. The MSCI index for this region fell 9.1%, a drop higher than in New York, where the respective MSCI index lost 8.3%. The Lisbon drop in the PSI 20 index was 9,3Yeah.\nIn New York, Wall Street recorded a real black Thursday the 27 of February with the Dow Jones 30 index recording the largest collapse (at points) in its history and the volatility index reaching levels close to August 2011.\nThe end of the month could have been even more dramatic on Wall Street if the U.S. Federal Reserve had not published a statement by its President Jerome Powell earlier this Friday afternoon guaranteeing that the central bank will use \"all the tools\" to support the American economy, whose \"foundations remain sound\".\nDonald Trump would then add that he hopes the Fed will be involved and soon. The future principal rate of the US central bank, which is in the interval between 1,5% and 1,75%, points to three cuts in the rate by summer, starting at the next meeting in the 18th March, with a reduction of 50-base points of money cost for the interval between 1% and 1,25%. By August, the managing fee should drop to 0.5% to 0,75% according to the futures market traced by the CME.\nMany investors hope that, even informally, a coordinated response from the world's major central banks to the threat to economies will occur. Next week, meetings of Australia and Canada's central banks will be followed with the utmost attention. In the following two weeks, meetings of the European Central Bank (March 12th) and the Fed (March 18th) will be held, discussing new inflation and growth forecasts.\nAlthough the epicenter of the new coronavirus is in China and the first wave of contagion covers Asia, the region's pockets lost six,1% in February, according to the MSCI index for Asia Pacific, a much lower percentage drop than globally.\nThe region that experienced the deepest crash in February was Latin America, with the MSCI index losing 12,4Yeah.\nIn the raw material markets, the price of the barrel of oil led to the falls in February. Brent's price (European variety) fell 14% and the quotation of WTI (US) dropped 13%. Brent's quote fell at the end of the month to fifty dollars, a price level that has not been observed since the summer of 2017.\nTwo raw materials stood out on the rises in February: palladium, a rare metal indispensable for car catalysts that is more expensive than gold, and coffee.\nDespite the financial panic to reinforce, as a rule, the race for returned values, the price of gold rose in February only 0.2%, as investors decided to sell in order to carry out liquidity.\nThe race for safe values led to a sharp drop in interest on US Treasury bonds ten years ago which descended into new historical minima and closed February in 1.16%. German obligations ten years ago, another sheltered value, fell even more on negative ground and closed in -0,6%",

The aim is to \"coordinate an EU-wide analysis of the effects of the outbreak on European industry and companies\", explains Brussels.\nAs early as Thursday, Thierry Breton announced that Brussels was already preparing, if necessary, \"support measures\" for the economic sectors weakened by Covid-19, but did not specify the possible aid. According to the European official, many sectors are being affected by the epidemic, including tourism, because \"the Chinese have not been coming to Europe for two monthsYeah.\nAccording to the European Commissioner for Industry, 250 thousand Chinese tourists did not travel to the EU between January and February, which represented a reduction in two million sleep, and also affected European air carriers.

Delta will also reduce to five times weekly its services between Seoul and Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle through April 30. In total, Delta is shrinking its typical 28 U.S. weekly flights to Korea to 15.  \n The airline's new service from Seoul-Incheon to Manila, previously scheduled to begin on March 29, will now start on May 1.  \n South Korea has the most virus cases outside China andreported 334 new cases on Thursday for a total of 1,595. South Korea also reported its 13th death linked to the virus.  \n On Wednesday, Hawaiian Airlines Inc said it would suspend its five-times-weekly service between Honolulu and Seoul-Incheon beginning on Monday through April 30.  \n The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department on Wednesday both issued travel advisories urging Americans to avoid non-essential travel to South Korea.  \n With U.S. air travel demand slumping, JetBlue Airways Corp <JBLU.O> said that starting on Thursday through March 11, it would suspend change and cancel fees for new flight bookings for travel completed by June 1.  \n The airline said the policy \"is designed to give customers confidence that they will not be charged any JetBlue fees for changes or cancellations later given evolving coronavirus concerns.\"  \n U.S. carriers have canceled all flights to China through late April, while the United States barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who traveled recently to China from entering the United States and required U.S. citizens who recently visited China to return home at one of 11 U.S. airports for enhanced screening.  \n At a news conference on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he was not imposing restrictions on travelers from additional countries with large numbers of cases like South Korea or Italy. He did not rule out imposing additional travel restrictions at a later date if needed.  \n On Wednesday, the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation Committee, Representative Peter DeFazio, and the chair of the subcommittee overseeing aviation, Representative Rick Larsen, wrote the U.S Transportation Department asking how the government \"plans to effectively prepare for the imminent arrival of a pandemic caused by coronavirus COVID-19 on U.S. soil.\"  \n The two Democrats said U.S. airlines had expressed concern about the scope of requests by the CDC and expectations regarding airlines' collection of certain inbound passenger data. The CDC has expressed concern about its ability to access information from the airlines.  \n On Monday, United Airlines Inc <UAL.O> said near-term demand to China had almost disappeared and that demand for the rest of its trans-Pacific routes had dropped by 75%.  \n  \n (This story has been refiled to correct number of flights per week to 28 from 35 in paragraph two after company revised statement.)

        "news_content_translate_en": "LONDON - The new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China, in December has infected tens of thousands of people in China and beyond and triggered alarm around the world. (https://www.reuters.com/live-events/coronavirus-6-id2921484) Here is what we know about the disease it causes and how it spreads:  \n  \n * Like other coronaviruses, the new virus - which causes a disease now called COVID-19 - is transmitted from person to person via droplets when an infected person breathes out, coughs or sneezes. It can also spread via contaminated surfaces such as door handles or railings.  \n * Scientists in China who studied swabs from infected patients say the new coronavirus behaves quite like flu viruses, suggesting it may spread more easily than previously thought.  \n * COVID-19 infection has an incubation period of between one and 14 days, and a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association has found new evidence that the virus can be spread asymptomatically.  \n * A World Health Organization-led team of investigating scientists in China has said that the epidemic there peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining steadily since then.  \n * They also found that the case-fatality rate is between 2% and 4% in Wuhan and 0.7% outside Wuhan.  \n * Infectious disease and virus specialists estimate that each infected person in the epidemic is infecting, on average, two to three other people.  \n * The WHO said on Monday that the COVID-19 outbreak was not out of control globally and does not have a large-scale death toll, so it was \"too early\" to speak of a pandemic.  \n * Coronavirus infections have a wide range of symptoms, including fever, coughing, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Mild cases can cause cold-like symptoms, while severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory illness, kidney failure and death.  \n * Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that get their name from what they look like under a microscope - they are spherical and their surfaces are covered with \"crown\"-like spikes.  \n * Animal viruses can mutate or combine with other viruses to create new strains capable of being passed to people. Scientists say the new coronavirus originated in bats and then passed to humans, possibly via an intermediary animal species.  \n * Genetic data suggests the new coronavirus is the result of viral recombination - a process where more than one virus infects the same cell at the same time and creates a \"recombinant\" virus strain.

        "news_content_translate_en": "As someone with a little bit of OCD, dining out during the era of COVID-19 is like navigating a minefield. You become hyper aware of your surrounds and micro decisions are required almost every step of the way. For instance, when approaching the entrance to a restaurant, there’s the door handle: use one’s elbow or fish out a piece of tissue paper to touch it? Or perhaps wait two seconds and someone will hopefully open the door from the inside? \n Once seated, I notice the cutlery placed on the table, resting on but a flimsy barrier of paper napkin beneath. I wonder how long it’s been sitting there, and if it has picked up possible pathogens on the tabletop left by the previous customer. Is it terrible to ask for a fresh set? “I get inexplicably happy when I see forks, spoons and chopsticks individually wrapped in plastic these days,” says a colleague whose most pressing concern at the moment is not waging a war against single-use plastic. After a lengthy scrub at the toilet sink, I return and panic a little when the waiter hands me a greasy menu. Damn, should’ve washed my hands after ordering. I eye the raw items on the menu: sashimi, salad, and wonder if getting some is akin to dicing with death. \n And then, the server fills my water glass. To my dismay, he picks it up by the rim — where my lips would soon touch. Should I throw caution to the winds and drink it anyway? My equally fastidious friend laments, “just the other day, a waitress stood too close over my food and took forever to explain every single dish. I couldn't help but think of all that saliva.”  \n Many of these fears are born from paranoia, but some are legitimate causes for concern. Still, if one wanted to be almost 100% virus-free, the only way is to never leave home and eat all three meals cooked in one’s own kitchen. But because this isn’t possible for most working Singaporeans like me, it warms the cockles of my germophobe heart when I see the various safety measures painstakingly taken by many eateries during this fraught period. Especially when restaurants and even famous hawkers are seeing significant dips in their business as Singaporeans avoid crowded places. It’s tough enough cooking and waiting on people for a living, but imagine having to do that while constantly disinfecting tables, chairs, (even menus), having to take one’s temperature twice daily, washing one’s hands nonstop and trying to breathe through a surgical mask. It’s both touching and reassuring. \n Compiled below are a few of the steps employed by restaurants to help curb the spread of this virus. Now, go forth and dine out. Have a good time, support these hardworking folks and keep our makan scene alive. Just don’t forget to wash your hands. \n Seven branches including 593 Havelock Rd, S169641. Tel: 6235-7716. yahuabakkutteh.com.sg \n While the chopsticks and spoons at this Bak Kut Teh chain used to be housed in a communal container, each set is now thoughtfully wrapped in plastic and placed on every table. So you don’t have to worry about other customers’ paws digging through twenty chopsticks, or anyone coughing onto them. Not the most environmentally-friendly, but it sure is hygienic.  \n Restaurant staff ensures each guest sanitises his/her hands at the entrance before entering the dining room. \n On a recent visit, we noticed all the wait staff donning surgical face masks. “We started wearing them two weeks ago,” says an auntie.  \n  \n 23 branches including #B1-03 Paragon Shopping Mall, S238859. Tel: 6836-8336. www.dintaifung.com.sg/index \n General manager of Din Tai Fung Singapore, Hoo Hoe Keat, tells us that the restaurant chain has already been practicing certain hygiene procedures even before the COVID-19 outbreak. “Din Tai Fung is one of the pioneers in the industry to provide hand sanitisers for all our customers, as well as alcohol-based sanitisation of tables and chairs after each use at our restaurants”.  \n Mr Hoo adds: “In addition to these existing practices, we have further enhanced safety measures during this period by implementing nightly surface disinfection of restaurant premises using 75% alcohol [cleaning solutions]”. That Ghostbusters-esque (Germbusters?) spray thingy that uncle is wielding looks gratifyingly potent. Now where can we find a portable one for spraying everything?  \n There are now mandatory daily temperature checks and face masks for staff at all Din Tai Fung restaurants island-wide. The GM also tells us that the staff is separated into two teams to “minimise exposure”. Moreover, “nourishing herbal teas are provided to them and senior management members also visit the restaurants to check on their [employees’] well-being”. \n Hand sanitiser is provided for all diners at DTF — even before this virus scare.  \n Two branches including 1022 Upp Serangoon Rd, S534760, Tel: 6287-4328. www.facebook.com/pages/Yongs-Teochew-Kueh/167896229901740 \n This popular soon kueh and png kueh specialist on Upper Serangoon Road (there’s also a branch in East Coast) sees long queues on weekends. But while customers used to crowd inside the shophouse space, they’re now ushered to queue outside the storefront. A shop assistant takes orders outside, scoots back into the shop to pack the requisite kuehs and brings them out for folks. Customers then enter two at a time to pay at the cashier inside (which has been shifted to just two metres from the entrance for convenience). “We’ve reorganised things for everyone’s welfare. Instead of 15 people inside the shop waiting to order, we now allow two to three customers in at one go. So not everyone has to gather together [in an enclosed space]. It’s also airier outside,” explains towkay Desmond Koh, 61. “This is mostly on weekends when it’s busier. If there’re only a couple of customers each time on weekdays, we let them order inside the store,” he elaborates.  \n He shares: “We’ve also placed hand sanitisers at the cashier counter as well as on one of our dine-in tables. We take the temperature of our staff each day when they arrive and when they leave. And we use disinfectant to clean our items”. However, they don’t mask up because “the government says only those who are sick should wear it. Also, there’s now a mask shortage”.  \n Two outlets including #02-256 Jewel Changi Airport, S819666. www.shakeshack.com.sg  \n   \n “Shake Shack takes the temperature of all guests before they enter the Shack,” says a spokesperson of the fine casual American burger chain. This applies to both its outlets at Neil Road and Jewel Changi Airport. \n   \n The statement includes: “Shake Shack has put in place hand sanitisers for its staff and customers at all cashiers and throughout the Shack in both its restaurants at Jewel Changi Airport and 89 Neil Road, and increased the frequency of hand sanitisation for its employees.” \n   \n   \n “Shake Shack has also taken proactive steps to brief staff and ensure that personal hygiene is kept as the utmost priority, including daily temperature checks for supplier delivery personnel to the Shack, and all staff before they commence work.” \n 25 outlets, including Crystal Jade Palace #04-19 Takashimaya Shopping Centre, S238872. Tel: 6735-2388. www.crystaljade.com/index/  \n Many Chinese restaurants in Singapore have taken a beating from the aftermath of the COVID-19 spread. Once-difficult to book eateries are now quieter — we managed to secure seats at the last minute easily this weekend even at popular joints. Perhaps it's the perception that Chinese eateries are a hotbed for Chinese nationals — from staff to customers. But relax, The Crystal Jade group is stepping up its efforts to keep everyone safe. Its PR rep tells us it has “ensured adequate supplies of masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectant for staff’s [and customers'] use” at its restaurants.  \n Better still, the usual wet towels across all casual and fine-dining Crystal Jade outlets have been replaced with these antiseptic, antibacterial wipes (at the regular 40 cents wet towel cost, no extra charge). They may not contain the recommended virus-destroying alcohol, but at least they have disinfecting ingredients such as chlorhexidine, and is definitely better than plain old wet tissue. \n Sanitisers have also been placed at all entrances and cashier areas for customers’ use. And the group has increased the frequency of cleaning of commonly used areas such as ordering kiosks. Daily temperature checks are also taken for all staff and suppliers. \n   \n Two outlets including #01-03 Blk A Clarke Quay, S179020, Tel: 6250-9270. www.facebook.com/TsuiwahSingapore \n While the Jumbo group which owns the Singapore franchise rights to this cha chaan teng chain from Hong Kong declined to comment for this story, our friend who dined at Tsui Wah’s Clarke Quay branch recently told us that all diners had to have their temperature taken before entering the eatery. She says: “If your temperate is in the safe range, you’re given a sticker to slap onto your shirt and you're good to go (otherwise you’re turned away)”. She also mentioned that hand sanitiser is provided at the entrance, and all the wait staff wore masks. Moreover, tables are disinfected after each customer is done eating. \n 10 branches including #01-29A/52 Plaza Singapura, S238839. Tel: 6251-2000. www.timhowan.com  \n At this HK dim sum hotspot, tabletops, counters and point of sale systems are cleaned with sanitising solution four times daily — before lunch, after lunch, after tea time and post-dinner. The staff also undergoes daily temperature checks — anyone with a temp of 37.5 degrees Celsius and above, or who are unwell, must go home. Employees are also required to “wash their hands hourly”. \n #33-01 Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1, S018981. Tel: 6834-3133. www.level33.com.sg  \n What we find especially reassuring is that the menus at this craft beer brewery and Western food joint are sanitised with alcoholic solution after every guest is done flipping through it. Like their PR rep tells us, the menu is indeed an “overlooked” item — we can’t count the number of times we’ve cringed after being handed greasy, stained menus after cleaning our paws. Also: tables are sanitised with disinfectant after each use, the bar counter is cleaned every 30 minutes, so too the eatery’s toilets. We approve. And of course, hand sanitisers are distributed throughout the venue for staff and guests at the entrance, washrooms, work stations and host’s desk. Says its PR spokesperson: “As LeVeL33 is a high-volume venue, serving about 500 guests a day, they feel strongly that they have a responsibility to be vigilant and take care of guests and staff. Guests can be assured that as always, LeVeL33 is going above and beyond so that they can continue to relax and enjoy themselves as usual”. Moreover, RQAM, LeVeL33’s landlord, has set up stations for temperature screenings of all individuals before they're allowed to enter the building. \n 17 outlets, including Imperial Treasure Steamboat Restaurant #01-140 Great World City, S237994. Tel: 6235-6008. www.imperialtreasure.com \n Temperature checks are conducted for all Imperial Treasure customers before they enter each of their restaurants. Hand sanitisers are also provided at the front desk for diners to disinfect their hands (staff are also given sanitisers). Moreover, employees now undergo temperature checks twice daily.  \n Commonly used areas such as cash registers and the reception table are required to be disinfected twice a day; before every lunch and dinner service. \n Four branches including 27 Lor Liput, Holland Village, S277738. www.project-acai.com \n The 20-cent takeaway fee has been abolished for customers who prefer to tapow instead of dining in at this healthy dessert establishment. The management tells us, “since 31 January 2020, we ceased collecting our takeaway surcharge, as we felt that customers may prefer to takeaway their orders during this period (of the COVID-19 outbreak), particularly as some of our locations can get quite busy during peak periods”. \n Project Acai has also since ceased the use of communal spoon holders at all of its four outlets “to minimise the contact between different customers and clean spoons. We now give spoons (as well as straws) to customers directly when they pick up their order”. Bravo. On top of this, the usual measures like temperature-taking of staff, reminding them to sanitise hands more frequently, providing them with masks if requested, and cleansing menus, electronic devices (iPads), tables, door handles, kitchen counters, and equipment surfaces throughout the day are taken. Nice.  \n Blk 39 Malan Rd, Gillman Barracks, S109442. Tel: 6694-0807. www.nakedfinn.com  \n Artisanal seafood shack Naked Finn asks all its diners if they’ve been to China over the last 14 days — whether it’s via phone reservations or walk-ins. Anyone who says yes will be politely turned away. Also, founder Ken Loon says, “Every staff member has a bottle of hand sanitiser — we spray customers’ hands when they arrive.

"作为一个有点强迫症的人，在COVID-19时代外出就餐就像在雷区航行。你对周围的事物变得高度敏感，几乎每一步都需要微观的决定。例如，当接近餐厅的入口时，门把手就在那里：用手肘或是用一张纸巾去摸它？或者等两秒钟，希望有人从里面开门？\n一坐下，我就注意到放在桌子上的餐具，放在下面一层薄薄的纸巾上。我想知道它在那里呆了多久，是否在上一位顾客留下的桌面上发现了可能的病原体。要一套新的是不是太可怕了？一位同事说：“最近我看到叉子、勺子和筷子单独用塑料包装，我感到莫名其妙的高兴。”他目前最担心的是，不要对一次性塑料发动战争。在洗脸盆里洗了很长时间后，当服务员递给我一份油腻的菜单时，我又惊慌失措了。该死，点完菜就应该洗手。我看了一下菜单上的生菜：生鱼片、色拉，想知道买些生菜是否像是在和死神切肉。\n然后，服务员把我的水杯灌满。令我沮丧的是，他拿起它的边缘-我的嘴唇很快就会接触。不管怎样，我是不是应该把戒心抛到九霄云外，喝了它？我同样挑剔的朋友感叹道：“就在前几天，一个女服务员站得离我太近，花了太长时间来解释每一道菜。我忍不住想起了那些唾液。”\n其中许多恐惧源于偏执狂，但也有一些是令人担忧的正当理由。尽管如此，如果一个人想要几乎100%不受病毒感染，唯一的办法就是永远不要离开家，把自己厨房里做的三餐都吃了. 但因为这对像我这样的大多数新加坡人来说是不可能的，所以当我看到许多餐馆在这段忧心忡忡的时期里不辞辛劳地采取的各种安全措施时，我那充满病菌的心就暖了起来。尤其是当新加坡人避开拥挤的地方时，餐馆甚至著名小贩的生意都出现了显著的下滑。做饭和等人谋生已经够难的了，但想象一下，在不断消毒桌椅（甚至菜单）的同时，还要这样做，每天要测两次体温，不停洗手，还要试着用外科口罩呼吸。这既让人感动又让人放心。\n以下是餐馆用来帮助遏制这种病毒传播的一些步骤。现在，出去吃饭吧。祝你玩得愉快，支持这些辛勤工作的人，让我们的马坎生活充满活力。别忘了洗手。\n七个分支机构，包括593

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — ComfortDelGro cabbies and Grab private-hire drivers will be receiving more help from their respective companies to mitigate falling fares due to the Covid-19 outbreak. \n This is separate from the S$77 million package that the Government introduced last week to help embattled taxi and private-hire drivers. \n ComfortDelGro Taxi said on Thursday (Feb 20) it will be providing cabbies with rental rebates until the end of April 2020, which will cost the company S$10 million. \n “We have been monitoring the situation very closely and have received feedback from our cabbies who have been asking for help,” said Mr Ang Wei Neng, the chief executive of ComfortDelGro Taxi, in a press release. \n From Feb 21 until the end of March 2020, a daily rental rebate of S$16.50 will be given to each taxi, amounting to S$660 for the period. \n This will be followed by a daily S$10 rebate for the entire month of April. \n The help package announced last week will see drivers receiving up to S$20 per vehicle per day for three months, contributed equally by the Government and operators. \n For ComfortDelGro cabbies, the new rebates mean that they will get a daily rental reduction of S$36.50 till the end of March, S$30 till the end of April and S$20 till May 13. \n The extra financial assistance comes amid falling demand for taxi services due to the Covid-19 outbreak. \n With tourist arrivals plummeting and an increasing number of companies allowing their staff to work from home to reduce the risk of infection, cabbies have seen their income drop between 20 per cent and 30 per cent. \n “We felt that we needed to do more. Hopefully this latest package will help our cabbies ride through the tough times,” said Mr Ang. \n “We will continue to watch the situation closely and do more if needed.” \n GRAB DOLES OUT ITS OWN INCENTIVES \n On the same day, ride-hailing company Grab also announced its plan to assist its drivers. \n It is part of the Special Relief Fund that was announced last week. \n Eligible drivers will receive up to S$85 per week to supplement their fare earnings between March 2 and May 30. \n This is in addition to the Government’s support of S$70 per week. \n In total, those who are eligible for the Special Relief Fund will receive up to S$155 per week, or up to about S$2,000 for the entire period, on top of their fare earnings. \n “We have been working hard to minimise the impact of the Covid-19 situation on their livelihoods in the past weeks,” said Mr Andrew Chan, Grab Singapore’s head of transport. \n Grab is devoting a total of over S$17 million towards safeguarding its drivers’ well-being and livelihoods, the company said. \n Grab is also providing additional income support and rental waivers for drivers who may be placed under quarantine, or has been given leave of absence or hospitalised. \n Drivers also get free insurance that covers them in the event that they are diagnosed with Covid-19. \n AID FOR AVIATION SECTOR \n Separately, Changi Airport Group (CAG) has also announced details of its assistance packages to help beleaguered firms. \n All airlines that operate flights between mainland China and Singapore will get “landing credits”, CAG said in a statement. \n Carriers like Singapore Airlines that continue to operate scheduled passenger flights between mainland China and Singapore during the outbreak period will get a 100 per cent landing charge rebate for these flights. \n Singapore carriers operating scheduled flights will also get rebates on parking and landing charges, as well as regulatory fees. \n Meanwhile, retail, food and beverage, and service operators at Changi Airport will receive a 50 per cent rebate on their basic rentals for six months from February. \n This is in addition to an automatic rental offset tied to passenger movements at Changi Airport. \n Correction: An earlier version of this story stated that the S$20 rebate for ComfortDelGro cabbies will last until the end of May. This is incorrect. The rebate ends on May 13. We are sorry for the error. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING/GENEVA - New coronavirus cases in the Chinese province at the epicentre of the outbreak fell for a second straight day, but deaths rose after the World Health Organization had cautioned there was not yet enough data to know if the epidemic had slowed.  \n Hubei reported 1,693 new cases as of Tuesday, down from 1,807 the previous day and the lowest number in the province since Feb. 11. But deaths rose by 132, up from 93 the previous day. The latest figures bring the total number of cases in China to over 74,000 with about 2,000 deaths.  \n The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, where the virus is believed to have originated, died of the disease, becoming one of the most prominent victims since the novel virus first appeared at the end of last year.  \n Illustrating the impact of the outbreak on worldwide growth and corporate profits, oil prices tumbled and equity markets slid after Apple Inc issued a revenue warning due to the disruption the disease is causing to global supply chains.  \n World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Chinese data \"appears to show a decline in new cases\" but any apparent trend \"must be interpreted very cautiously.\"  \n Outside China, there have been 827 cases of the disease, known as COVID-19, and five deaths, according to a Reuters count based on official statements. More than half of those cases have been on a cruise ship quarantined off Japan.  \n Tedros said there had been 92 cases of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus in 12 countries outside China.  \n \"We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship,\" he said.  \n Russia, however, was taking no chances. Starting on Thursday, it will suspend entry of many Chinese citizens.  \n By the end of this week, the WHO said, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are due to have the ability to detect COVID-19.  \n \"Many of these countries have been sending samples to other countries for testing, waiting several days for results. Now they can do it themselves within 24-48 hours,\" Tedros said.  \n China says figures indicating a slowdown in new cases in recent days show that aggressive steps it has taken to curb travel and commerce are slowing the spread of the disease beyond central Hubei province and its capital, Wuhan.  \n The WHO's Mike Ryan said China had success with \"putting out the fire\" first in Hubei and ensuring that people returning to Beijing from the Lunar New Year holiday are monitored.  \n \"Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,\" Ryan said  \n The numbers appear encouraging, said Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Britain's University of Edinburgh, who described himself as cautious.  \n Chinese state television said Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died on Tuesday, the seventh health worker to fall victim. The hospital was designated solely for treating virus-infected patients.  \n  \n GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS  \n Despite global concerns about the economic impact of the disease, China's ambassador to the European Union said on Tuesday this would be \"limited, short-term and manageable\" and that Beijing had enough resources to step in if needed.  \n Chinese state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying China could still meet its economic growth target for 2020 despite the epidemic.  \n Economists are warning of potential mass layoffs in China later this year if the virus is not contained soon.  \n \"The employment situation is OK in the first quarter, but if the virus is not contained by end-March, then from the second quarter, we'll see a big round of layoffs,\" said Dan Wang, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Job losses could run as high as 4.5 million, he forecast.  \n Britain's biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks because of the coronavirus.  \n Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world, and Hubei province is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments.  \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the economy there was in an emergency situation and required stimulus as the epidemic had disrupted demand for South Korean goods.  \n Singapore announced a $4.5 billion financial package to help contain the outbreak in the city-state and weather its economic impact.  \n Japan, where the economy was already shrinking and the epidemic has created fears of recession, the spread of the virus has prompted Tokyo to put limits on public crowds while some companies are telling employees to work from home.

Holland America Line said it is working with governments and health experts to track passengers who disembarked from its cruise ship. \n There were more than 2,200 passengers and crew on the ship when it docked in Sihanoukville, many of whom have now dispersed around the globe. \n The cruise line, which is owned by cruise giant Carnival Corp, said none of the other 1,454 passengers and 802 crew have reported any symptoms. \n There have been fears about the virus spreading via cruise ships after COVID-19 cases were found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. \n The ship docked off Japan's Yokohama now has more than 450 infections, forming the biggest cluster of cases outside China.

        "news_content_translate_en": "Each week, TODAY’s long-running Big Read series delves into trends and issues that matter. This week, we look at what drove Singaporeans across the island to wipe supermarket shelves clean of daily essentials earlier this month, and what it says about the population’s resilience in times of crisis. This is a shortened version of the full feature, which can be found here. \n SINGAPORE — While Singaporeans have earned a reputation for being kiasu (Hokkien for the fear of missing out), the scene that played out on Feb 7 at supermarkets across the island was something no one has witnessed here before — not even during the Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. \n Hours before, the Ministry of Health (MOH) raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level from Yellow to Orange. \n The risk-alert level was raised after several novel coronavirus cases were detected in the Republic without any links to previous cases or travel histories to China. \n To allay public anxiety, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made a speech a day after the panic buying, assuring Singaporeans that there was no need to panic as the city was not being locked down, and there was ample supply of food for everyone.  \n Now that a sense of normalcy has returned, questions remain to be answered: What caused all that panic-buying over that fateful weekend, which had left some quarters fuming — and embarrassed — over the behaviour of “ugly Singaporeans”, and others to question whatever happened to decades of efforts aimed at building a resilient society? \n And what does it say about Singaporeans, many of whom have stoically and quietly got on with their lives, despite the uncertainty and disruptions to daily life?  \n Customers picking out instant noodles and other non-perishables at Giant Supermarket in Beauty World Centre on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n THE SITUATION ELSEWHERE \n So far, apart from Singapore, there have been no reports of panic buying in places outside of China.  Residents in Thailand for example, which has 33 confirmed cases as of Friday, told TODAY that the situation was calm and there has been no run on daily essentials. \n Some experts believe that events in Hong Kong, which was gripped by scenes of panic buying recently, had influenced Singaporeans’ behaviour.  \n Speaking to TODAY, Mr Wong Bai Chun, a Hong Kong citizen, said that two weeks ago, there was a brief but acute shortage of toilet paper and other paper goods in the territory, which was sparked by an Internet rumour that the Chinese spring holiday was being extended and there would be insufficient supplies of such products. \n OTHER TRIGGERS \n Negativity bias \n A spokesperson for the Singapore Psychological Society (SPS) council said this is a phenomena where our brains tend to focus more on negative information than positive ones. \n “Our brains are hardwired to register negative stimuli more readily and also to dwell and worry on them for a longer period of time,” the spokesperson told TODAY. \n Self-preservation and groupthink \n Whenever there is a life-threatening epidemic or emergency, the notions of safety, protection, and self-preservation usually come into play. \n “Research suggests that when people are in panic, the thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system and we start to act illogically,” said the spokesperson. “Our ability to decide on our own is minimised.” \n The spokesperson added that people tend to follow others in the hope that the latter could get them out of a dangerous situation. \n In Singapore’s case, this could be a possible reason why people started to hoard or buy things impulsively if everyone else around them was doing the same, or if they were told to do so on social media platforms. \n Social-media \n Mr Lars Voedisch, the managing director of public relations firm PRecious Communications, said the panic-buying is triggered by one or two initial incidents which then get amplified by social media. \n “(This leads) to a snowball effect of more and more people thinking of it, then hearing from the first people acting on their fear, sharing about it and through that fuelling the whole panic,” he said. \n Singapore Management University sociologist Paulin Straughan said it did not help that the public was seeing these images circulated on social media late in the night. As a result, these became the abiding images for many Singaporeans overnight.  \n “For the next 12 hours, the shelves remain empty (in their minds),” she said. “And that’s 12 hours of festering, and it entrenches (the fear that there are no supplies).” \n Agreeing with Mr Voedisch, she reiterated that while technology has helped to disseminate information a lot faster, it has similarly allowed misinformation to spread just as quickly as well. \n This was not something that Singaporeans had to worry about during the past virus outbreaks, she added. \n Empty shelves at Fairprice Finest in Bukit Timah Plaza on Feb 7, after the Dorscon alert level was changed to Orange. Photo: Raj Nadarajan/TODAY \n PUBLIC COMMS ‘COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER’  \n Communications experts told TODAY that the panic-buying in Singapore might have been avoided if the information disseminated by the authorities had been clearer.   \n “The problem with the message was that it was too bureaucratic at the start,” said Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Assistant Professor Liew Kai Khiun.  \n “Much of the Government’s message involved military terms (and) colour codes,” said Asst Prof Liew, who teaches at the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). \n Prof Straughan agreed, noting that the definition of Dorscon Orange was not explained enough as well. \n Dorscon is a colour-coded framework that shows the current disease situation.  \n Orange refers to a situation in which a virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. Previously, the risk assessment level was at Yellow, signifying that the virus was severe and could infect from person to person, but was chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The highest level, Red, indicates that the virus is spreading widely and can result in major disruption such as closing schools. \n “Some people didn’t know what it meant. All they saw was the visual,” said Prof Straughan. “There are four levels. Green, Yellow, Orange and Red. Red is bad, everybody knows that right? Green is good. Now Orange. It is closer to Red than it is to Green. So visually, it lights up all your flags.”  \n Asst Prof Liew pointed out while the message from the authorities was accurate, it did not cater to the layman. To that end, they could have used dialect or Singlish to reach out more effectively, he noted.  \n During the Sars outbreak in 2003, local sitcom character Phua Chu Kang was used to educate Singaporeans on the importance of washing their hands.  This, he said, was an effective way of reaching out to the public, and many people still remember it today. \n A leaked MOH press release a few hours before the official Dorscon Orange announcement, which left many befuddled, might have also fuelled the public panic.  \n The press release was circulated on social media and through messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. \n Up till this incident, Prof Straughan felt that the Government had been doing well in being upfront with Singaporeans about the virus situation. But when the press release was prematurely leaked out, it created some confusion.  \n She said it did not help that recipients of the leaked document were initially told by others that it was fake news, only to be informed by the authorities a few hours later that it was indeed true.   \n Such contradictory information would have led some to question if the authorities were trying to hide something, she said.  \n The authorities have yet to announce the source of the leak, but Mr Chan said on Feb 9 that the various agencies involved in tackling the virus will remind their staff that they have a professional responsibility not to prematurely share information that has not been finalised. \n Despite these short-comings in public communications, some of the experts felt that Mr Lee’s nine-minute long speech on Feb 8 went some way in restoring some sense of normalcy.   \n The SPS council spokesperson said Mr Lee’s message gave people very concrete actions that “handed back a measure of control to people whose sense of control felt threatened”. \n Mr Voedisch said having the Prime Minister step in to address the public helped, because it went beyond technocratic statements and directly addressed what people were concerned with. \n “While authorities should not get emotional when communicating, they have to be empathetic appealing to the hearts and minds of the audience,” said Mr Voedisch. \n However, he was uncertain if an address by Mr Lee to the public at an earlier juncture would have helped.  \n Instead, he said that the authorities should have foreseen the responses from the public as part of proper scenario planning with “ready-to-go action plans”. \n Also, they should have anticipated and addressed the public’s concerns and fears across the different platforms, he added.  \n  \n Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a recorded message which was televised a day after Singapore raised its Dorscon alert level to Orange. Photo: MCI \n ​HERE COMES THE GOOD \n Still, despite the panic buying grabbing the headlines, Mr Chan and other government leaders took pains to point out that a large majority of Singaporeans had been “calm and rational”.  \n Many Singaporeans had come forward to thank the cashiers and supermarket staff constantly working behind the scenes to restock the empty shelves, Mr Chan noted.   \n Countless others have also stepped in to do their part for their fellow citizens, with numerous ground-up initiatives started in the community. \n For example, TODAY had reported about two primary school girls who used their pocket money to buy and deliver breakfast to doctors and nurses. On Valentine’s Day which fell on Friday, community group StandUpForSG also gave out “love letters” to frontline healthcare workers. \n QUIET RESILIENCE  \n Away from the public spotlight and media glare, ordinary Singaporeans have got on with their lives, despite the disruptions and worries brought on by the Covid-19 outbreak.  \n Scores of Singaporeans — such as taxi and private-hire drivers, as well as those in the retail and tourism industries — have seen their livelihoods taken a hit. Others have had to adjust to working from home as business continuity plans swung into place. \n Cleaners, for example, are putting in longer hours while healthcare workers not only have to work longer each day but are also putting themselves at risk on the frontlines.     \n A 23-year-old outbreak nurse who works with Covid-19 patients said that while her family understands the risks of her occupation, it does not stop them from worrying.  \n “Most nurses are worried too, but it’s our job and this is what we do for a living,” said the nurse, who wanted to be known only as Sharmaine due to the sensitivity of her role. \n When she was first assigned to handle suspected Covid-19 cases, Sharmaine said she was scared as no one knew what exactly they were dealing with.  \n “But over time, I grew immune to it, even if a patient were to test positive for the virus. Now I don't feel so scared anymore.” \n However, she feels disappointed at the discrimination against healthcare workers shown by some Singaporeans, even as many others expressed gratitude for their work. \n “It truly is demoralising when you hear of such incidents. We feel ostracised at times because all we want to do is perform our job and go home,” she said. “But we continue to keep an open mind because we are the first line of defence.” \n Some businesses have had to adjust their operating models due to the outbreak. \n Ms Jazz Chong, the owner and director of contemporary gallery Ode To Art, has noticed fewer people visiting the gallery as well as the Raffles City Shopping Centre, where the gallery is located.   \n “With the virus outbreak becoming more severe, we have now decided to take the extra measure of bringing the art to our clients directly,” she said. “If they like the work then it can remain in their home, making it extra convenient for them as they do not even have to leave their house.” \n Business owners like Ms Chong are hoping that people would continue life as normal, albeit taking the necessary precautions.  \n Or as NTU’s Asst Prof Liew put it: “We must have a courageous sense of normality and go on living life normally.”  \n Indeed, Prime Minister Lee noted on Friday that the Covid-19 outbreak is expected to last longer than Sars, with a greater impact already hitting the economy. \n But he stressed: “We have to keep Singapore going and we have to keep making a living.

        "news_content_translate_en": "SINGAPORE — As food and beverage (F&B) businesses take a hit due to the Covid-19 outbreak in Singapore, Jewel Changi Airport is now offering a 50 per cent rebate on rent for its F&B tenants for the months of February and March.  \n The Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) revealed this during a press conference on Thursday (Feb 13) and calls for other landlords to follow suit to help them ride through this crisis.  \n Jewel, a retail and leisure complex, opened less than a year ago. \n On Monday and Tuesday, the association sent out letters to 24 landlords — some of them major mall developers such as CapitaLand and Asia Malls — requesting that they offer rental rebates of up to 50 per cent for the months of February, March and April.  \n RAS has more than 450 members representing close to 700 brands that operate more than 4,000 outlets. \n Based on a snap poll the association conducted among its members from Monday to Thursday, 57 per cent of the 302 respondents said that they expect revenue to drop by more than half over the next three months.  \n Close to 60 per cent said that they are not prepared or equipped to deal with the abrupt nature of the virus outbreak.  \n Respondents also said that measures to address wage and rental costs were their top two areas of concern. \n The novel coronavirus, now known officially as Covid-19, originated in Wuhan of China’s Hubei province, and has now spread to 28 countries, including Singapore.  \n On Thursday, the Ministry of Health announced eight new people who were infected with Covid-10, bringing the total number of diagnosed cases to 58, the highest number in the world outside of China.  \n RAS’ president Vincent Tan said that the F&B sector has reported a 50 to 80 per cent decline in business since the virus outbreak, with more shoppers staying home and avoiding malls or other crowded places.  \n “If we don’t do something to help the industry, there will be a big collapse,” he said.  \n LANDLORDS NEED TO BE ‘SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE’  \n As rent makes up a high proportion of operational costs for restauranteurs, RAS is calling on landlords to be “socially responsible”.  \n Mr Andrew Tjioe, president adviser of the association and also chief executive officer of Tung Lok Group, said that they are trying to avoid a situation where they have to ask their employees to go on unpaid leave.  \n “I think we really want to avoid this. This is the time that landlords and tenants have to be in good partnership and landlords have to do the social responsible thing to help us protect jobs,” Mr Tjioe said.  \n “You can see how our landlords are performing financially, and there is an imbalance of distribution of income. It’s a very, very heavy burden on F&B operators,” he added, saying that both landlords and tenants need each other to survive.  \n The association said that restaurants are starting to engage fewer part-time workers and some have even started asking full-time staff members to go on unpaid leave.  \n While there are no closures yet, Mr Tan said that many restaurants are now quite empty as shoppers avoid malls.  \n Referring to how the sector suffered back in 2003 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) disease struck, Mr Tan recalled that business bounced back only six months after the outbreak ended.  \n “So we need to help (restaurants) these three to six months. Let us overcome the situation. We are not asking for long-term rental rebates. We are asking for help to ride through this very difficult time,” Mr Tan said.   \n  The Restaurant Association of Singapore told reporters at a press conference that it is appealing to landlords and the Ministry of Trade and Industry for support to tide through the slump during the Covid-19 outbreak. Photo: Janice Lim/TODAY \n In Hong Kong, reports have emerged that landlords of major malls are cutting rents for the month of February by as much as 60 per cent to help tenants through the coronavirus outbreak.  \n When asked whether RAS have received any response from any of the 24 landlords, the association said that some have replied by saying that they wish to understand the situation more and speak to the individual tenants directly.  \n While RAS recognises that landlords are trying to help tenants by bringing in more shoppers, such as CapitaLand launching a S$10 million marketing campaign, Mr Tan said that these efforts do not help them immediately.  \n A rental rebate would have a direct impact on the bottomline of the restaurants, he added.  \n ‘HAEMORRHAGING FROM ARTERIES’ \n As for the likely impact if landlords do not agree to reduce rents, Mr Andrew Kwan, vice-president of the association, said that restaurant closures would be likely because it is “just untenable”.  \n “It’s not something where you can kind of wait it out over a few months without any sort of assistance. \n “I liken this to a patient that is haemorrhaging from the arteries. We don’t have time to say that, ‘Let’s assess and let’s decide what’s the next measure’, and then slowly stop the bleeding. It’s something that is happening very rapidly,” Mr Kwan said.  \n During this period, some F&B outlets have reported an increase in food delivery orders, but the association said that this increase is not enough to cover the drastic drop in business at the physical outlets.  \n RAS has also written a letter last Sunday to Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing, asking for help in these areas. \n First, it hopes that the Government can help reduce labour costs by temporarily waiving foreign worker levies and providing wage credits.  \n Second, it is appealing to government agencies such as the Housing and Development Board, National Parks Board, Singapore Tourism Board and industrial estate developer JTC to get them to offer rental rebates to their tenants as well.  \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "PARIS (BLOOMBERG) - Alibaba Group is offering Europe's embattled health systems a cloud-based coronavirus diagnostic tool it says it has successfully tried in China's hospitals. \n The move by billionaire co-founder Jack Ma's technology giant comes amid a bigger push by China to promote its efforts to contain the pandemic that started in the city of Wuhan and was left undiagnosed for a few weeks before spreading to the rest of the world. \n The company said it presented its machine-learning software for chest scans to healthcare representatives in France and Italy. \n Alibaba's efforts come as China and its top technology companies step up their outreach in Europe, showcasing virus-diagnosis and analysis tools. Telecoms giant Huawei Technologies said it offered Italian hospitals video conferencing and wireless connectivity capabilities. Internet search engine Baidu is proposing an algorithm to analyse the virus's biological structure. \n As Europe becomes the epicentre of the virus, Beijing's diplomatic and material efforts in the fight against the outbreak coincide with what's seen as an attempt by the Trump administration to distance itself from the region. \n \"Alibaba and other private companies are enrolled by China's government in its long-term plan: show their ability to be an ally for Europe, and pass the message that the US is failing to help them,\" said Dr Antoine Bondaz, a researcher at the Strategic Research Foundation in Paris. \n France wouldn't refuse the help being offered, and that if Alibaba wanted to contribute to research and diagnosis it could be allowed to, a French government official said, declining to be named in line with internal policy. \n The health ministry said it hasn't received a proposal from Alibaba, adding that the \"techniques have not been validated\". The diagnostic tool is also seen as costly and time-consuming. \n Alibaba, which has been expanding its European footprint in the payments and retail sectors, claims its software, developed at its research centre called Damo, can diagnose the Covid-19 virus quickly and with 96 per cent accuracy. The company says it has tested the product in China on 5,000 patients. \n Artificial intelligence-powered scans have been increasingly used in hospitals, and companies like Alphabet Inc's Google have developed data-learning solutions to help doctors diagnose diseases like cancer. \n In Europe, no private company or research lab has come forward with a broad diagnosis solution so far. Atos SE, the big data and cybersecurity company, said it has offered computing capabilities to reproduce and model the 3D atomic structure of the virus to labs in Spain and France. \n In the United States, Alphabet Inc's healthcare unit Verily ran tests for about 20 people on its first day screening the virus on Tuesday (March 17) in California. Verily is a questionnaire-based diagnostic tool. Potential patients answer questions to determine if they need testing and are then redirected when required to Verily's two testing sites where another sample is taken, Bloomberg reported. \n Meanwhile, in Italy, Huawei said it donated protective suits and 200,000 masks to hospitals in Milan. Mr Thomas Miao, chief executive officer of Huawei Italy, said the company also offered equipment for wireless networks to about 10 temporary hospitals and said it's working with partners to create a video-conferencing platform for a real-time connection between hospitals. \n Alibaba said it shipped two million masks to the continent through Belgium last Friday. \n On Wednesday, the company published a \"digital handbook\" to \"share their learnings from screening, to diagnosis and treatment of patients who contracted Covid-19, as well as sanitation and facility management\".

        "news_content_translate_en": "WASHINGTON (AFP) - The United States and China on Monday (March 16) each demanded that the other stop smearing its reputation over the novel coronavirus as the pandemic became the latest row between the powers. \n The clash came on the day that the World Health Organisation said more cases and deaths had been reported in the rest of the world than in China, where the new coronavirus virus was first detected late last year. \n US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a phone call he initiated with top Chinese official Yang Jiechi, voiced anger that Beijing has used official channels \"to shift blame for Covid-19 to the United States\", the State Department said. \n Mr Pompeo \"stressed that this is not the time to spread disinformation and outlandish rumours, but rather a time for all nations to come together to fight this common threat\", the department added. \n The State Department last Friday summoned the Chinese ambassador, Mr Cui Tiankai, to denounce Beijing's promotion of a conspiracy theory that had gained wide attention on social media. \n Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, in tweets last week in both Mandarin and English, suggested that \"patient zero\" in the global pandemic may have come from the US - not the Chinese metropolis of Wuhan. \n \"It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation,\" tweeted Mr Zhao, who is known for his provocative statements on social media. \n Scientists suspect that the virus first came to humans at a meat market in Wuhan that butchered exotic animals. \n Mr Pompeo himself has sought to link China to the global pandemic, repeatedly referring to Sars-CoV-2 as the \"Wuhan virus\" despite advice from health professionals that such geographic labels can be stigmatising. \n Mr Yang issued a \"stern warning to the United States that any scheme to smear China will be doomed to fail,\" the official Xinhua news agency said in its summary of the call with Pompeo. \n The key Chinese foreign policy leader \"noted that some US politicians have frequently slandered China and its anti-epidemic efforts and stigmatised the country, which has enraged the Chinese people\", Xinhua said. \n \"He urged the US side to immediately correct its wrongful behaviour and stop making groundless accusations against China.\" \n US President Donald Trump, under fire over his handling of the pandemic, and his allies have sought to cast the coronavirus as a disease brought by foreigners. \n Republican Senator Tom Cotton, a Trump ally, has spoken of the \"Chinese coronavirus\" and in a recent statement vowed, \"we will hold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\". \n While Covid-19 - the disease caused by the virus - has largely come under control in China, it has killed more than 7,000 people around the world and severely disrupted daily life in Western countries. \n The pandemic comes at a time of wide-ranging tensions between the US and China on issues from trade to human rights to Beijing's military buildup. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China suffered an even deeper slump than analysts feared at the start of the year as the coronavirus shuttered factories, shops and restaurants across the nation, underscoring the fallout now facing the global economy as the virus spreads around the world. \n Industrial output plunged 13.5 per cent in January and February from a year earlier, versus a median estimate for a 3 per cent contraction. Retail sales fell 20.5 per cent in the period, compared to a projected 4 per cent fall. \n Fixed-asset investment dropped 24.5 per cent, versus a forecast 2 per cent decline. The unemployment rate jumped to 6.2 per cent, the highest on record. \n Gross domestic product is now all but certain to contract in the first quarter compared to the same period last year - the first time that has happened since comparable data began in 1989. \n \"Covid-19 made the economy stop, from factories to spending,\" said Iris Pang, ING Bank NV in Hong Kong. \"As the coronavirus spread to almost everywhere, global demand and global supply chains will take a hit and will feedback to China's manufacturers and exporters in March and April.\" \n The outbreak of deadly viral pneumonia in Wuhan dramatically worsened in January, prompting China to lock down Hubei province, extend holidays and restrict travel and business across the country. \n That brought much of the nation's economic activity to a halt in February, undercutting a stabilisation seen in December. \n While there are increasing signs that companies and people are getting back to work in March, the economy is still not back to normal. \n Even as governments in China and some other Asian nations look to be getting their outbreaks under control, the coronavirus is now spreading rapidly in Europe, the US and other parts of the world. \n That will likely hit demand for Chinese exports, extending the damage to firms and the economy. \n \"China is bottoming out. But it's not going to be a V-shaped rebound,\" said Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group in Hong Kong. \n The People's Bank of China bank acted last Friday to support the economy, providing banks more money to lend by cutting the amount of cash they must place in reserve at the central bank. \n It refrained from cutting the interest rate of its medium-term loans on Monday in step with the Federal Reserve. The move signals it'll maintain a targeted, measured easing approach for now, in spite of the bad economic data. \n \"The data are awful,\" said Macquarie Group chief China economist Larry Hu. \"It's clear that the coronavirus is both a supply shock and a demand shock. It hurts both internal and external demand. It brings both inflation and deflation pressure. As such, we don't expect massive stimulus coming out anytime soon, but China will stay in the current rate-cutting cycle.\" \n ",

But the spread of the virus, which causes fever, cough and breathing difficulties, has already caused widespread disruption. \n St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said China's economy was expected to \"slow noticeably\" in the first quarter and anyone pricing assets should for now consider the \"tail risk\" that the outbreak could get worse. \n But Bank of England governor Mark Carney said the financial spillover from the outbreak looked containable, though it was still early to judge the economic impact. \n WHO's Dr Tedros was less sanguine about the coronavirus. \n \"To be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, social and economic upheaval than any terrorist attack,\" he said. \"It's the worst enemy you can imagine.\" \n The impact of travel curbs, lockdowns and production suspensions is being felt increasingly on China's economy. \n JPMorgan analysts downgraded forecasts for Chinese growth this quarter and Norwegian energy consultancy Rystad Energy predicted the outbreak would cut growth in global oil demand by a quarter this year. \n Cisco Systems Inc, Facebook Inc, AT&T and Sprint Corp became the latest US technology companies to pull out of an international telecoms conference in Barcelona because of the outbreak. The organiser of the event, the telecoms industry's biggest annual gathering, will discuss whether to cancel it, an industry source said. \n Inside China, more than 300 companies are seeking bank loans totalling 57.4 billion yuan (S$11.4 billion) to help cope with the disruption, banking sources said. \n Prospective borrowers include food delivery giant Meituan Dianping, smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp and ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing Technology Co. \n Chinese firm Xinchao Media said on Monday it had laid off 500 people, or just over a tenth of its workforce, and restaurant chain Xibei said it was worried about how to pay its roughly 20,000 workers. \n The authorities said they would roll out measures to stabilise jobs. \n The World Bank ruled out any new health loans to China, though technical assistance would be offered. \n Hubei, where the flu-like virus emerged from a wildlife market in the provincial capital of Wuhan, remains in virtual lockdown, its stations and airports shut and roads blocked. But its health authority reported 2,097 new cases and 103 new deaths on Feb 10. \n With public anger rising, Hubei's government dismissed the provincial health commission's Communist Party boss Zhang Jin, and director Liu Yingzi, state media said. \n Washington, whose travel measures have offended Beijing, authorised the voluntary departure of US government employees and family members from Chinese-ruled Hong Kong \"out of an abundance of caution\", the State Department said. \n Dr Anne Schuchat, an official from the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said she hoped the first group of Americans evacuated from Wuhan could be released from their quarantine on Tuesday. \n Off Japan's port of Yokohama, the Diamond Princess cruise ship with 3,700 passengers and crew remained quarantined, with the number of confirmed cases at 135. \n Thailand said it had barred passengers from getting off another ship, Holland America Line's MS Westerdam, though no confirmed infections have been found on board. \n LISTEN TO HEALTH CHECK PODCAST \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Authorities in Anhui province, China, have reported that a Chinese national who visited Bali late last month has tested positive for the coronavirus disease Covid-19, as Indonesian authorities scramble to verify the information on Wednesday (Feb 12). \n The administration announced via Weibo on Feb 6 that the Huainan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on Feb 5 that a patient, identified only as Jin, flew on Lion Air flight JT2618 from Wuhan - the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak - to Bali on Jan 22. The patient stayed on the island for about a week before flying on Garuda Indonesia flight GA858 from Bali to Shanghai on Jan 28. \n The patient was found to have been infected with the coronavirus on Feb 5 by Huainan CDC according to the Weibo post. \n \"For passengers on the aforementioned flights, please enact preventative measures immediately,\" wrote the Anhui administration on its Weibo account, which is a local version of Twitter. \n \"Please don't go out for a while and if you get a fever, go to the nearest hospital,\" the statement said. \"Please use masks when you travel to the medical centre and don't use public transportation,\" it went on. \n Garuda Indonesia spokesman Dicky Irchamsyah said he had not yet received a report about the case but \"will check up on it\". Lion Air spokesman Danang Mandala separately said he would also look into the case. \n Meanwhile, the Health Ministry's disease control and environmental health director-general, Mr Anung Sugihantono, said his office had not yet received the information and was still \"confirming it\" but he was quick to say that it was \"a rumour\". \n The ministry advises regular washing of hands, avoiding uncooked meat and wearing face masks when sick to minimise the chances of contracting the disease. \n The Jakarta Post first obtained the information about the Anhui administration's statement from a Chinese citizen who sent a letter on Wednesday. The citizen provided two links: one was the Weibo post and the other was a search page for \"Epidemic situation, public transportation epidemic inquiry\". \n The Post asked two Chinese journalists from two respected media in China to check whether the links are official or not and both confirmed that the links are official. \n The Chinese citizen who first informed the paper about the alert from the Anhui provincial authorities provided an English translation of the Weibo post and The Post also asked an Indonesian journalist friend who understands Chinese to translate it into Indonesian. \n The Post also ran a search with keyword \"GA858\" on the public transportation history site and found a result dated Jan 28 that contained a link to the Weibo post from Anhui. The newspaper also searched the site with the keyword \"JT2618\" but it did not show any result. \n The Post tried to contact the Anhui and Huainan CDC offices on Wednesday to find more information about the patient but calls were not answered. Indonesian Ambassador to China Djauhari Oratmangun told the Post he had yet to receive any information about the matter but he would find out more information. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "(REUTERS) - The effects of the coronavirus outbreak are likely to reverberate beyond China as most major economies in the region are expected to either slow down significantly, halt or shrink outright in the current quarter, Reuters polls of economists found. \n Singapore is forecast to be the worst affected from the fallout, with growth dropping by more than 1 percentage point for 2020. The least impact would be on Indonesia, which is expected to grow 4.7 per cent this year. \n A port city and a major trade partner with China, Singapore is expected to contract 0.6 per cent in the January to March quarter of this year, a first since the 2009 recession after the global financial crisis. \n Many Asian economies, which were just limping back to growth from the spillover effects of the 18-month United States-China trade dispute, were again dealt a blow by the outbreak, which has shut down businesses and cities. \n With the Covid-19 contagion interrupting global supply chains that most countries depend on for trade and commerce, economic activity is likely to slow, but at varying degrees. \n Forecasts from economists collected from Feb 19 to 25 showed that Singapore, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand are all expected to put in their worst performance in years in the first quarter. Only Indonesia is expected to remain relatively unscathed. \n \"The impact of the coronavirus on economies in Asia is potentially huge, as tourism in the region takes a beating. From deserted hotels to empty airports, the impact of this little scrap of protein and lipid on economies in the region is potentially enormous,\" said Mr Robert Carnell, chief economist and head of research for Asia-Pacific at ING in Singapore. \n \"If this doesn't sound sufficiently scary, bear in mind that tourism is just one of the channels through which the coronavirus can weaken the GDP growth of Asian countries grappling with this epidemic.\" \n A similar Reuters poll published a little over a week ago found that the Chinese economy will grow at its slowest pace in the current quarter since the financial crisis, with a worst-case scenario showing it at 3.5 per cent, nearly half of the 6 per cent reported in the fourth quarter of 2019. \n \"The base case is rapidly shifting from 'Bad', meaning only China is impacted, to 'Ugly', where both emerging Asia and developed economies see soaring infection rates and deaths,\" said Mr Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Asia-Pacific at Rabobank in Hong Kong. \n \"Its effects will likely resemble the global financial crisis of 2008-2009 more than the Sars outbreak in 2003,\" he said, referring to the economic impact. \n That fear in financial markets was clear on Monday, when world stocks took a nosedive to a two-year low as a surge in virus infections outside mainland China fuelled fears of a global pandemic. \n Proximity to the region's economic powerhouse and trade relations mean any impact from a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy is likely to be felt across the region. \n While a bounce back in the next quarter is expected for most major Asian economies polled, growth for this year is likely to be lower than predicted just last month, suggesting some activity would be permanently lost. \n More than three-quarters of economists, 57 of 77, who answered an additional question also expect growth across these other Asian economies to pick up in the second quarter. \n While South Korea was the hardest hit by the virus outside China, its impact on the economy so far seems modest, according to forecasters who expect it to grow 2.1 per cent in the first quarter, down only 0.4 percentage point from a January Reuters poll. \n Thailand's and Taiwan's economies are forecast to expand at a paltry 0.2 per cent and 1.3 per cent in the current quarter, the lowest in nearly half a decade. \n Australia's economy, a proxy for Chinese economic growth, is forecast to grind to a halt in the current quarter, ending the country's near three-decade growth streak that started in 1991. \n \"This (the virus outbreak) can be hurtful to growth in several countries beyond just the negative spillovers from China. A sharp rise in infections reported by several countries raises concerns of a deeper hit to these countries and also global growth,\" said Ms Johanna Chua, emerging markets Asia economist at Citi in Hong Kong. \n But if the grim outlook does not improve, under a worst-case scenario, economists expect growth in all countries polled to drop further by 0.5 percentage point to 1 full percentage point. \n ",

        "news_content_translate_en": "WUHAN (CAIXIN GLOBAL) - At least 19 people, mostly seniors, died in a social welfare facility in Wuhan located just one block away from the seafood market where the deadly Covid-19 outbreak is suspected to have originated, even though the local government acknowledged only one death from the virus. \n As of last Thursday (Feb 20), 11 seniors died from respiratory failure after recurrent fevers, a nurse at Wuhan Social Welfare Institute told Caixin. She said the facility's infirmary didn't have Covid-19 testing capability and many medical workers have had fever symptoms. \n The facility recently arranged chest CT scans at a nearby hospital for residents and staff. A scan report the nurse showed a Caixin reporter states that the patient has multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs, similar to many confirmed Covid-19 cases. \n Unexplained deaths from lung ailments among the elderly at the Wuhan Social Welfare Institute and similar facilities suggest that nursing homes may be another blind spot as the government's epidemic-fighting efforts have focused on hospitals and other communities. \n Last week it came to light that Chinese prisons reported more than 500 previously uncounted Covid-19 cases among guards and inmates. \n At least two other nursing homes in Wuhan also recorded deaths either possibly from the virus or confirmed cases. A family member of an 85-year-old resident at Gu Tian Rong Ji Nursing Centre told Caixin that his mother died at the nursing home and the family suspected she was infected by a care worker. The head of the nursing home acknowledged that one of the caregivers was confirmed with the coronavirus but denied that the deceased resident was infected by the worker. \n Another community senior care centre with about 40 residents also found eight tested positive for the virus. The rest of the residents and staff are quarantined at the centre and no visitors are allowed, a community worker said. \n The Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau disputed the report about the Wuhan Social Welfare Institute Friday night through the government's official WeChat account, saying the facility checked its residents and staff and found that 11 seniors tested positive for the virus and one of them died while being transferred to a hospital. \n According to the government response, the welfare facility started testing residents and staff on Feb 11, although Caixin learnt from sources that multiple seniors died between late December and Feb 19 after showing virus symptoms such as fever, breathing difficulty and loss of appetite. \n After Wuhan tightened quarantine measures to restrict people from leaving their homes and to send the sick into makeshift quarantine quarters, many people lost contact with elderly family members in nursing homes. Family members of people in nursing homes say they have been trying to find out how many residents may be infected, where the elderly are quarantined, whether there are caregivers, what test results show and whether the government can send more medical and care staff to institutions. \n A list of the dead at the social welfare facility obtained by Caixin showed 15 fatalities between Dec 23 and Feb 11 and four more on Feb 18. Of the total of 19 fatalities, only the death of an 83-year-old male on Feb 15 was clearly linked to Covid-19. Eight others were attributed to infections, including six to lung infections and two deaths from shock caused by infection. The remaining 10 fatalities were reportedly from other causes, and five of them took place before Feb 11 when the nursing home started testing for Covid-19. \n The nursing home has never before had so many deaths in such a short time, according to a staff member who has worked there many years. Except for one 27-year-old female with cholecystitis, all of the 18 others on the fatalities list were in their 80s and 90s and most had diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke or disabilities, according to the list. \n The facility, just a few hundred yards from the seafood market that may have been the starting point of the outbreak, is a combination senior hospital and nursing home. It is home to 458 senior residents with 190 staff, 21 property management personnel and eight care workers. The facility has been sealed off since Jan 21 as local authorities stepped up efforts to contain the outbreak. All staff have been asked to stay in the facility. \n A doctor in the welfare facility's infirmary said he participated in the treatment of a patient in late December who had a fever as high as 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit (42 deg C). The patient died from septic shock possibly caused by infection, but the cause of infection was unknown because no virus check was done, according to the doctor, who was later confirmed infected with Covid-19 himself. \n The doctor said he treated three seniors who died since late December. Several doctors, nurses and attendants have also shown symptoms of lung infection, the doctor said. \n A care worker said more than 10 seniors died during the Chinese New Year holiday. At first, they had fever and lost appetite. Those with recurrent fevers were transferred to quarantine rooms but died after a couple of days, the worker said. \n \"Since they were never confirmed with tests, we don't know whether they died from the virus,\" the worker said. \"But before the outbreak, even though many of the seniors at the nursing home have chronic diseases, we have never seen so many deaths in such a short time.\" \n A family member with the last name Zhu said he was told his 92-year-old father died from a heart attack on Feb 11 in the infirmary. The nursing home called the son on Feb 9, telling him to take his father to a hospital because he had a fever of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (40 deg C). As the son had a fever himself and his community was locked down, he couldn't come to the nursing home. \n Some family members of deceased seniors told Caixin that the nursing home didn't take sufficient protective measures and residents were not even asked to wear masks. \n The doctor at the infirmary said the nursing home wasn't sealed off until Jan 21, when the outbreak was already spreading quickly in the city. Because it was close to the Chinese New Year, there were many visitors at the nursing home every day. It hasn't been ruled out that visiting family members might have brought the virus into the nursing home, the doctor said. \n A medical worker at the nursing home said it's also difficult to implement quarantine measures because of staff shortages and residents with dementia. \n Hubei Vice-Governor Wan Yong emphasised on Saturday in a video conference that nursing homes face severe situations as the elderly are at high risk of infection. The Wuhan Civil Affairs Bureau said on Friday that it aimed to finish screening tests on every person in nursing facilities that have found confirmed or suspected vases by Saturday and will finish tests in all other nursing facilities by Feb 28. \n Bao Zhiming, Xiao Hui, Gao Yu contributed to this report. \n This story was originally published by Caixin Global. \n ",
